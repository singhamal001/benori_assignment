    "## Overview\n",
    "This document describes a Python script that extracts text from PDF files and saves the extracted text into .txt files.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Script Functionality\n",
    "- Reads PDF files from the `pdf` folder.\n",
    "- Extracts text using the PyMuPDF library (`fitz`).\n",
    "- Saves the extracted text into a separate .txt file for each PDF in the `txt` folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dependencies\n",
    "- Python\n",
    "- os\n",
    "- fitz (PyMuPDF)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Code Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Function Descriptions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **extract_text_from_pdf(pdf_path)**\n",
    "   - Extracts text from a PDF file using PyMuPDF.\n",
    "   - Iterates through each page to collect text.\n",
    "   - Handles exceptions if extraction fails.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **save_text_to_file(text, txt_path)**\n",
    "   - Saves the extracted text into a .txt file.\n",
    "   - Ensures text encoding is UTF-8 to handle special characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **convert_all_pdfs_to_txt(pdf_folder, output_folder)**\n",
    "   - Iterates through all PDF files in the input folder.\n",
    "   - Calls `extract_text_from_pdf()` for each PDF.\n",
    "   - Saves the extracted text using `save_text_to_file()`.\n",
    "   - Creates the output folder if it doesn’t exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Main Script Logic**\n",
    "   - Calls `convert_all_pdfs_to_txt()` with `pdf` as the input folder and `txt` as the output folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Brief Explanation\n",
    "This script automates the extraction of text from PDFs saved in the `pdf` folder and exports them as .txt files in the `txt` folder, using PyMuPDF for reliable text extraction.\n"
