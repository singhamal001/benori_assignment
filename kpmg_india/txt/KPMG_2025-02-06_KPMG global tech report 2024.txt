Foreword
A key theme from this year’s research is the perception among 
tech executives that they are struggling to keep up with the pace 
of change. In response to this sense of falling behind, organizations 
may be tempted to make a hurried response. However, this can lead 
to misguided investments that may prove both risky and expensive, 
potentially increasing the burden of technical debt which many 
well-established organizations are already struggling with.
Our research suggests that organizations are increasingly aware of 
this dilemma, and they are looking to pivot from imitating others to 
becoming leaders themselves. Typically, technology leaders are paving 
the way by bringing structure, discipline and an enterprise mindset to 
the adoption of new technology.
In doing so, they are looking to evidence-based investment decisions 
that align to the broader business and technology strategies and balance 
value creation with appetite for risk.
Overall, the sense from our respondents is that organizations are 
doing well with measurable improvement in many areas over the 
past year. Mistakes provide great learning opportunities for the 
future, and the positive perspective on progress shared by our 
survey participants is encouraging.
2,450
technology professionals worldwide 
from a variety of industries
The relentless speed of technology innovation is undeniable. When combined with a natural fear of missing out, 
ideas that may once have seemed like science fiction are rapidly converting into tangible reality. From generative AI 
to quantum computing, the potential benefits are huge, and so is the risk of making costly mistakes.
By taking a measured approach to technology investment, executives 
are already benefiting from key advancements while keeping a firm 
hold on their business models and successfully running the enterprise. 
A willingness to enter the realm of science fiction does not mean leaving 
the facts of sound business management behind.

Foreword
Identifying value amid the hype
To harness the full potential of the 
wave of new tech advancements, 
organizations must sustain a measured, 
strategic approach to investment.
Rapid change is driving fear of missing out (FOMO) 
Our research shows that the rapidly accelerated technology 
innovation over the past year has amplified a strong sense of FOMO 
among organizations. 
The flood of AI-related news entering the mainstream has stirred 
a collective interest in AI that transcends seniority and technical 
expertise. This has only served to stoke the fires of ‘tech-envy’ and 
could encourage a ‘spend now, ask questions later’ attitude.
Digital transformation can bring many exciting benefits, and 
ambition to progress is only healthy, but organizations must not let 
it distort their judgement. Progress paranoia could lead to misguided 
investments and disjointed implementation initiatives. 
Despite FOMO, organizations are taking a more 
balanced approach to investment decisions
While execs continue to look at the trends set by their market peers 
for guidance, this year sees more of them basing investment decisions 
on their own primary evidence. 
This year, executives are drawing on a wider range of sources to 
inform their investment decisions. All investment drivers measured in 
Tapping into the pace of change 
is something we are focused 
on and excited about, all in the 
context of doing so in a safe 
and secure way.

means their organization is 
slower than competitors to

2023 have seen an increase in prevalence for 2024 by an average of 
15 percentage points. 
That said, the drivers have shifted in terms of which has the strongest 
influence on tech choices. While following competitors is still a top 
decision driver in 2024, it has fallen to third behind looking to third-party 
guidance (89 percent) and in-house trials and proof of concept (PoC; 
83 percent of the base). This may reflect the desire for organizations to 
overtake competitors in getting emerging tech to market.
Still, for many, FOMO remains a strong influence on investment 
decisions: 82 percent are still choosing tech investments such 
as virtual and augmented reality (VR and AR) in order to follow 
in their competitors’ footsteps. In comparison, the study’s digital 
transformation high performers are 22 percentage points more likely 
than other organizations to rely on customer feedback. And these 
leading organizations place following competitors outside of their top 
three motivations for investing in certain tech.

Organizations are spreading their bets across the  
tech portfolio
Compared to 2023, tech implementation maturity has improved across 
the board, with the biggest increases seen in data analytics and XaaS. 
In the 2023 tech report the most common implementation stage 
for XaaS was that companies had a strategic vision but were limited 
because of low buy-in or investment approvals. This year, the majority of 
organizations are proactive in progressing against their XaaS strategies. 
Priorities for further 
investment over the next 
year include XaaS, which 
86% 
chose, as organizations 
focus on the agility and cost 
reductions enabled by cloud 
computing.
Across all tech, ASPAC is the region that is most likely to be at the 
proactive implementation stage, with India and China leading the way. 
Priorities for further investment over the next year include XaaS, 
which 86 percent chose, as organizations focus on the agility and 
cost reductions enabled by cloud computing. Other priorities include 
cybersecurity (68 percent), AI/automation (65 percent) and edge 
computing (61 percent). These investment appetites indicate that 
many organizations put tech at the core of their business strategies.

Organizations are getting better at delivering 
value from tech investments
For many organizations, tech adoption is paying off. Most 
(72 percent) agree that their digital transformation decision-
making processes usually lead to outcomes that generate 
business value. In fact, 69 percent of those surveyed are 
broadly satisfied with the value they generate from their tech — 
especially in China (90 percent), Netherlands (83 percent), 
Nigeria (80 percent) and Israel (79 percent). 
Across tech categories, an average of 87 percent of organizations 
have managed to use tech to increase profits over the past 
24 months. Across those categories surveyed in both 2023 
and 2024, there has been a 25 percentage point year-on-year 
increase in the number of execs who say these systems have 
had a positive impact on their company’s profitability. So there 
is an uplift in the number of organizations seeing tech initiatives 
boost profitability.

What do the high performers do?
How are leading organizations advancing more quickly along their digital transformation 
journeys? Our research suggests these high performers are:
Neglecting legacy systems can compromise new 
tech investments
The desire to accelerate transformation appears to be favored: 
74 percent of organizations say that over the next 12 months, 
they plan to focus on investing in new tech rather than on 
enhancing the value of their existing tech suite. 
There is a risk that the allure of new technologies distracts 
organizations from addressing flaws and technical debt in 
their existing systems. This approach can, in turn, undermine 
transformation progress. 
Often, unresolved issues in current tech infrastructure can 
obstruct the implementation of emerging tech. 
In fact, unaddressed tech debt blocking the path to new 
upgrades is one of the top challenges holding back the digital 
transformation progress of the study’s digital transformation 
high performers. Further, 57 percent of organizations overall say 
that flaws in their foundational enterprise IT systems disrupt 
business-as-usual on a weekly basis. 
“The longer you delay addressing tech debt, the higher the costs 
and risks become,” says Commonwealth Bank of Australia’s 
Gavin Munroe. “Continuous investment is crucial. Accumulated 
tech debt often results in embedded business rules and logic, 
which can make future replacements costly and complex. So, 
it’s essential to consistently invest in unraveling tech debt to 
avoid escalating surprise costs and complexity over time.” 
Organizations must strike a healthy balance between new and 
existing tech investments. Executives’ intentions to prioritize 
XaaS investments will help here. By replacing outdated systems 
and consolidating multiple functions into centralized hubs, XaaS 
platforms can reduce the complexity of infrastructures and the 
volume of redundant tech.
Less likely to be gripped by FOMO:  
In comparison to non-leaders, our leader group is 23 percentage points 
less likely to worry about keeping up with the pace of change. Also, they 
are five percentage points less likely than the mainstream group to be 
choosing technologies because their competitors have already done so. 
Iteratively course-correcting: 
High-performing organizations are adopting a more proactive and 
adaptive approach to evaluating tech investments. As many as 83 percent 
of leaders continuously evaluate the business value and outcomes of all 
tech investments, which is 17 percentage points higher than non-leaders. 
This always-on approach will provide organizations with more opportunity 
to intervene and optimize where required.
Utilizing primary empirical evidence: 
Leaders are 21 percentage points more likely than non-leaders to run 
calculations to forecast the potential value of tech initiative before 
they invest. 
Leaning on external sources of expertise:  
To enhance their digital transformation decision-making, 93 percent of 
our leader group plan to expand and strengthen their ecosystem and 
partnerships, compared with 70 percent of the mainstream sample.
Aware of tech debt: 
In contrast with non-leaders, leading organizations place unaddressed 
tech debt as one of the top challenges holding back digital transformation 
progress. To avoid escalating surprise costs and complexity over time, 
organizations must consistently invest in unraveling tech debt.

Optimizing value through evidence-based decisions
When measuring the effectiveness of 
digital transformation or the adoption 
of a certain piece of tech, it’s 
important not to get fixated on just 
one metric. You have to think about 
the implications a metric may have 
on other metrics, and adjust your 
approach accordingly. 
Naveen Zutshi 
CIO, Databricks
On balance, organizations are content 
with the outcomes of their digital 
transformation investments, mostly 
thanks to their ability to make sound 
decisions along the journey. 
With the pace of change pressuring tech 
execs, organizations must ensure haste 
does not compromise the quality of 
their judgment calls.
Investing for the long term is still a good discipline 
to follow
With execs fearing that their organizations are struggling to keep 
up with the pace of change, planning for the long term can be 
difficult when balancing the needs of the latest technological 
advancements. To maximize progress, tech execs should channel 
digital transformation efforts towards what matters most strategically 
to their organizations. 
“Where we’ve seen organizations achieving the most value from 
tech is where they step away from the habit of just following a tech 
trend for the sake of it,” says Michelle Chang, CFO/CVP of Microsoft 
Customer and Partner Solutions. “And, instead, start with, ‘What 
is our business trying to accomplish, what’s our purpose and what 
problems are blocking us from achieving our purpose?’ The answers 
to these questions will indicate how tech can help them move 
forward in a meaningful way.” 
Our study’s top performers get this, with 53 percent strategically 
evaluating their tech investment portfolio to ensure it is aligned 
with their long-term goals (compared with 41 percent of other 
organizations). The good news is that most execs want to imbue 
their tech initiatives to provide value in non-tech areas; 70 percent 
ensure that their tech investments directly target their sustainability 
and social responsibilities. 
Executives understand that the value of tech goes beyond financial 
gain. “One of the lessons we’ve learnt is that tech initiatives cannot 
just be anchored in financial ROI — that’s not the only win available,” 
says Chang. “You must have other anchors of improvement in the 
KPIs, such as creating a better customer experience.”

Organizations are raising the bar on data maturity
According to the group of high performers in our research, frequent data-centric evaluation is one  
of the two effective tactics for achieving quick wins from tech investments. And the wins from  
data-centric approaches are stacking up. Organizations that are in the top two data maturity 
categories across the factors measured are more likely to be satisfied with the value generated 
across all their tech investments. For example, these organizations are likely to achieve better 
service reliability, as they are 18 percentage points less likely to say that flaws in their foundational 
IT systems disrupt business as usual on a weekly basis.
The data management maturity of many organizations is now strengthening across the board, 
setting a new corporate benchmark.

Conclusion and key recommendations
Foreword
Optimizing value through evidence-based decisions
Value must be quantifiable and comparable
Once executives have identified the problem areas that require 
support from tech, they need to deliver and measure value. 
For the executives in our research, the three most popular ways of 
measuring value are: 
In general, data maturity has increased, with over half of respondents 
(52 percent on average) now at one of the two highest levels of data 
proficiency — the influential/embedded stages, up from 40 percent  
in 2023. 
Cloud platforms play a key role in enhancing proficiency in this area. 
Better data management and integration is the most commonly 
identified gain from increased use of XaaS tech.
Organizations can do much more with customer 
feedback
According to our execs, directing tech investments towards the 
service pain points flagged by customers and employees is the 
most influential tactic for generating quick wins from IT investments. 
For instance, process points that have multiple handoffs between 
stakeholders and multiple systems of record, with complex contracts 
can often be riddled with human-error related execution issues 
resulting in delays for customers. As an example, using data mining 
to identify opportunities to employ smart contracts, supported by 
blockchain or tokenization, can target these pain points to speed 
up processing times and reduce the need for intervention from 
intermediaries, while ensuring strong transparency and security levels.
“Look at your major business processes and ask: Where are 
inefficiencies dragging you down and keeping your organization from 
achieving its purpose?” says Microsoft’s Chang. “These are the 
points where technology is likely to be uniquely helpful.” 
However, customer insights tend to be wasted: 78 percent of 
execs say their business fails to use customer feedback effectively. 
Perhaps this is because organizations are struggling to decide on 
the required action to address the user feedback, or there may be 
communication issues between front and back office. Ultimately, 
unless organizations get better at using customer insights, tech 
execs risk wasting their investments on low-value areas.
Business growth metrics, 
such as number of new 
products launched
Financial metrics, such 
as cost-to-serve and 
profitability
Customer-centric metrics, 
such as customer satisfaction 
and customer base growth
78%
of execs say their business 
fails to use customer feedback 
effectively.

Optimizing value through evidence-based decisions
What do the high performers do?
Which behaviors set leading organizations apart when it comes to defining and delivering value? Our research suggests they are more 
likely to:
Developing data-backed measurements tailored to the business 
helps organizations establish cause and effect when they choose 
and implement tech. Predictive modeling capabilities, when used 
alongside these metrics, can advance the value creation journey by 
enabling proactive decision-making, forecasting demand and internal 
performance changes, identifying growth and cost optimization 
opportunities, and mitigating potential risks. 
Metrics forecasts are a helpful reference point for tracking 
investment performance, enabling informed course correction 
where required. For instance, 73 percent of execs say they perform 
accurate cost forecasts in their digital transformation projects. It 
also follows that the majority (67 percent) manage to prevent hidden 
costs from disrupting their digital transformation journeys. 
But our leading organizations go further. Compared with other 
organizations, the top performers are more likely to use both 
qualitative and quantitative metrics to establish causal trends, and 
are more likely to use real-time data to guide decision-making. 
By continuously monitoring performance, organizations spot where 
to adjust in response to internal and external influences. As such, 
the high performers in the research are 10 percentage points more 
likely than the mainstream group to regularly review and update their 
value-tracking metrics to stay aligned with market changes. 
Make value-driven decisions aligned with their long-term goals: 
Leaders are dedicated to ensuring their daily decisions contribute to long-term strategic goals and organizational 
definitions of success. Over half (53 percent) of leading organizations strategically evaluate their tech investment 
portfolio to ensure it aligns with their long-term goals, 12 percentage points higher than non-leaders.
Get everyone on the same page: 
Despite the challenge of managing a growing number of priorities and stakeholders, high performers achieve speed 
to action by ensuring they have strong alignment across the organization. For instance, 90 percent of leaders can 
efficiently achieve consensus between stakeholders, whereas other organizations are 18 percentage points less likely 
to be able to do so.
Adopt an “always-on” approach to performance management: 
Leading organizations continually develop the quality and breadth of the inputs that are informing their decisions. 
For instance, leaders are more likely to regularly review and update their value-tracking metrics as the market changes 
and use qualitative and quantitative insights to assess their digital transformation plans.
Master the balance between acting as a risk guardian and a transformation accelerator: 
Leading organizations rank risk and cybersecurity metrics as most important for evaluating tech investments; 
87 percent are confident in their ability to measure this type of value (compared with just 66 percent of other 
organizations). Also these leaders are 21 percentage points more likely to ensure their portfolio of tech investments 
are balanced from a risk perspective.

Delivering resilient solutions
Securing the most value from 
identified opportunities relies on 
robust data-driven processes, 
security and governance. As 
they troubleshoot the problems 
that threaten their resilience, 
organizations are placing 
cybersecurity and data proficiency 
at the top of their priority lists.
Organizations are prioritizing data security, governance and accessibility
To achieve this level of data proficiency, organizations are pursuing a high level of data security, governance and accessibility through stronger 
compliance programs, frameworks and clear ownership and accountability of roles.

Data both drives and sustains digital transformation. 
Data maturity, security, and governance enable the pace of 
innovation, and can help improve customer experiences. 
Insufficiently secure solutions create the risk of data 
breaches, inefficiencies, or missed opportunities, which 
can erode business value and customer trust. Data security 
and governance form a robust transformation delivery 
infrastructure that underpins an organization’s strategic 
ability to differentiate, maintain cost effectiveness and 
manage risk in the digital era.

Foreword
Delivering resilient solutions
Data proficiency should be a core 
competency for the organization
While organizations are investing in data accessibility, 
research indicates that only 24 percent are focusing 
on nurturing a data-centric culture and ensuring data 
interoperability in the near term. This oversight presents a 
substantial barrier to fully harnessing technology’s potential 
and undermines the ability to effectively use and understand 
data across all levels of the organization. 
In a landscape increasingly dominated by data, it’s crucial 
that organizations break down these silos and cultivate 
a deep, enterprise-wide appreciation of data strategy. 
By doing so, they can accelerate digital transformation 
towards success by optimizing processes, and dynamically 
enhancing their products and services to meet customers’ 
evolving needs.
For sustainable innovation, execs need 
to prioritize trust and security
Execs must ensure that pace of innovation is sustainable, 
secure and that they can communicate value to 
stakeholders. The high performers in our research rate risk 
and cybersecurity metrics, including reduced frequency of 
cybersecurity incidents, improved compliance and lower 
failure rates, as the most important lenses through which to 
evaluate tech. They are also more likely to be confident that 
they can track their performance in these areas. 
This security-led stance of the leader group underlines the wider 
importance of trust, and how to pursue it. Overall, for the executives 
surveyed, cybersecurity and privacy are the biggest concerns for 
achieving a successful digital transformation. They also maintain that 
the top skill organizations need to thrive in a digital economy is the 
ability to ensure such considerations are front and center of business 
and tech priorities of the organization. 72 percent of organizations are 
embracing a secure-by-design mindset by involving and empowering 
cybersecurity teams in the early stages of tech investment projects. 
In fact, cybersecurity and privacy can enable organizations to pursue 
their business objectives securely and confidently, and embrace new 
opportunities. Organizations need to learn from our high performers 
group and do more to evaluate tech investments against risk and 
cybersecurity factors. For this to be comprehensive, cybersecurity 
experts need a seat at the table from the outset so they can advise 
on how security can be embedded to build resilience and trust. 
In doing so, cybersecurity and privacy can support the organization, 
as a trust enhancer and protector of brand reputation, by minimizing 
the need for costly retrofitting of security fixes and the risk of data 
breaches.
For many organizations, there is a disconnect between intentions 
and reality regarding the security-related habits of their workforces. 
Almost 8 in 10 (78 percent) respondents overall say that their staff 
training treats cybersecurity as a box-ticking exercise and it is not 
embedded as required.
Rather than rely exclusively on formal training sessions, 
organizations should focus on implementing controls and 
operational features that make cybersecurity easy for employees 
to embrace in their daily work. For instance, strategies such as 
automating DevSecOps processes or providing access to password 
manager platforms can promote more secure employee behaviors. 
Michael Wagner, CISO at Kenvue, agrees that cybersecurity and 
resilience must be at the forefront of daily tech usage. This includes 
maintaining business continuity plans, having a retainer with an 
incident response firm, testing backups and conducting regular 
recovery exercises. 
“Incident exercises, where different scenarios are presented, are 
vital so that we can be prepared should the worst occur,” says 
Wagner. “For instance, the CrowdStrike patch update issue [in 
July 2024] caused widespread IT outages around the globe.”
The wider picture here is that tech innovation is not the enemy 
of risk management — rather, they should reinforce each other. 
By starting with a clear definition of success that is rooted in  
their organization’s purpose, tech execs will be able to direct  
tech initiatives towards areas that will bring meaningful value. 
An insight-led approach will enable execs to prioritize and make 
decisions when it comes to delivering value.
Polly Sumner 
Chief Adoption Officer, Salesforce
When data is embedded and people are 
empowered, tools like AI are adopted very 
quickly and this creates value super-fast. 
Start with automation and free up people 
to do what they do best, more quickly and 
in more interesting ways.

Foreword
Delivering resilient solutions
Tie investment to value: 
Leaders consider it a top two priority to ensure data system 
investments align with the priorities of key business stakeholders, 
whereas other organizations place this outside of their top three  
focus areas. 
Perform routine data-hygiene audits: 
Eighty percent of leaders conduct routine data hygiene audits to 
address gaps in data integrity and create data ownership frameworks. 
Other organizations are 31 percentage points less likely to have this as 
a fundamental part of their strategies.
Use data and internal knowledge sharing to respond to 
market risks: 
Leaders say data-centric decision-making (61 percent) and internal 
knowledge sharing (48 percent) enable them to adjust their digital 
transformation strategies in response to evolving market risks 
(compared with 43 and 38 percent, respectively, of non-leaders). 
While data insights can sharpen risk resilience, internal knowledge 
sharing is crucial. By educating employees and keeping them informed 
of developments, organizations will empower them to adapt and 
contribute to positive change.
Prioritize data security:  
Leaders are 9 percentage points more likely than non-leaders to 
cite security as a key area of focus for improvement over the next 
12 months.
What do the high performers do?
How are the high-performing organizations strengthening their data backbones and 
using data as an asset to deliver secure digital transformation outcomes? Our research 
suggests these organizations are more likely to:
Involve security 
teams from the 
outset: 
Executives maintain 
that cybersecurity 
and privacy are the 
biggest concerns for achieving a 
successful digital transformation 
but, when it comes to security, 
moving at a measured pace is 
important. Involving cybersecurity 
and information governance 
teams from the outset of 
digital transformation initiatives 
will help minimize delays and 
enable businesses to progress 
investments confidently. To reduce 
security-related downtime, battle 
test your organization’s threat 
response reflexes. Kenvue’s Wagner 
suggests that business continuity 
plans, having a retainer with an 
incident response firm, backups 
testing and regular recovery 
exercises will prove vital here.
Challenge risk 
aversion by 
articulating the 
costs of inaction: 
A high 80 percent 
of executives say 
that a risk averse attitude leads 
senior leadership to respond to 
market forces more slowly than 
competitors. When faced with 
a scenario where risk aversion 
is influencing senior leadership 
towards gridlock, one helpful 
tactic to kick-start movement is to 
evaluate the risks of inaction against 
the change being considered. For 
instance, losing market share to 
competitors because of a failure 
to adapt your product offering. If 
analysis reveals that the threats 
associated with staying idle are 
too concerning to ignore, this can 
stimulate forward momentum and 
creative thinking to tackle challenges 
and manage the risks that come 
with embracing the change.
Accelerate 
progress by 
removing 
governance 
bottlenecks: 
Poor governance 
and coordination appear in the 
top three toughest challenges 
that derail transformation 
progress. For instance, 
58 percent say their centralized 
decision-making reduces their 
organization’s ability to respond 
to market signals and embrace 
new tech, while 57 percent say 
that friction and communication 
breakdowns occur frequently 
between teams at times of 
high workload.

How to overcome threats to digital transformation 
Executives are keen to speed up their tech progress, but to do so reliably, effective risk management is essential. 
Consider the following tactics to manage the most common threats to digital transformation velocity and quality.

Scaling AI with confidence
Applying AI as an organization can 
unlock a lot of excitement for your 
workforce because it can really boost 
employee wellbeing.
AI can take the pain out of longstanding 
problems that have previously sapped 
time and energy from employees and, 
in turn, enhance job satisfaction. 
Michelle Chang 
CFO/CVP, Microsoft Customer and Partner Solutions

Almost three-quarters of organizations 
are already achieving business value 
from their AI investments, but only 
one in three has been able to achieve 
this at scale.
Enthusiasm is being fueled by 
democratized experimentation 
approaches, but as use cases scale up 
many predict a tipping point marking a 
drive towards greater centralization. 
The AI ‘black-box’ is causing workforce anxiety
It is positive that 74 percent of respondents say AI is already 
increasing the productivity of their knowledge workers, improving 
their organization’s overall performance. Furthermore, just over 
8 in 10 respondents expect automation efforts to shift the focus of 
knowledge workers towards more creative roles, and that AI will 
even redefine the future of knowledge itself. 
However, AI is also fueling anxiety in the workforce. Consensus 
and trust will be the keys to progress. More than three-quarters 
of organizations (78 percent) are concerned that many users see 
AI as a ‘black box’. Almost as many (77 percent) expect AI to pose 
challenges to their current operational structures, potentially leading 
to job reduction and ethical concerns. 
Managing employee anxiety around change will be critical to AI 
adoption at speed. Those who navigate the evolving tech landscape 
with a focus on employee empowerment, and bringing everyone on 
board, will flourish amid rapid change. Organizations believe their 
workforce has an appetite for cutting-edge tech. But there is also 
fear that some individuals feel left behind by the rapidly evolving 
tech landscape. 
In an era where AI’s rapid evolution and adoption are reshaping the 
competitive landscape, tech execs need to rethink their strategic 
leadership roles. Three-quarters (76 percent) of tech execs surveyed 
feel that their role has evolved significantly over the past two 
years as the nature of tech and the workforce itself is changing. 
Tech execs must manage board level expectations during a period 
of hype cycles and cost sensitivity. At the same time, they must 
balance this against the need for a stable, coherent environment 
in which the workforce can harness AI, rather than stifling it. Tech 
execs play a critical role in steering their organizations through 
uncertain times, acting as a strategic innovator, adaptive pioneer, 
trend navigator and risk guardian. 
To find out more about the use cases for AI across the enterprise, visit our website.
Importantly, there are ways to address such concerns. KPMG’s 
Trusted AI1 framework, for example, emphasizes 10 pillars upon 
which to design, build, deploy and use AI solutions in an ethical 
manner. They include priorities such as fairness, sustainability, 
privacy, security and accountability.

Which of the following best describe how your company is 
experimenting with potential AI use cases?
Rather than a stringent centralized approach, organizations are 
adopting a more inclusive mindset around AI experimentation, 
crowdsourcing use cases from their workforces. The most popular 
approach is open collaboration, where diverse working groups 
conduct controlled experiments, sometimes supported by AI centers 
of excellence (CoEs) with representatives from every department. 
This approach is prioritized by organizations at the most mature level 
of AI implementation. Only 6 percent of organizations subscribe to 
a top-down approach to AI experimentation with heavy constraints 
around AI use from the outset. 
While initially encouraging democratized experimentation, many 
respondents (40 percent) plan a shift to a more centralized approach 
once they reach a critical mass of ideas that require stricter 
management to control risk and reduce duplication. In doing so, 
organizations should apply a balanced approach and steer away from 
overly stringent approval processes to avoid stifling innovation. One 
way of balancing speed with risk is driving alignment through cross-
functional CoEs or user groups, and only centrally managing AI 
initiatives that those groups identify as high-risk or high complexity. 
Regardless of their chosen experimentation approach, organizations 
have the opportunity to consolidate underlying processing and data 
infrastructure leading to gains in efficiency, reduced technical debt 
and a more effective end solution.
A systematic approach is key to prioritizing AI 
investment in alignment with business goals
To ensure the use cases with the greatest potential receive the 
attention and cross-functional support they require, there must be a 
strong roadmap to scaling and a clear link to business value. Many 
organizations are chasing short-term value by implementing AI tools 
in discrete parts of the value chain — that is, identifying specific use 
cases for deployment — where they see potential to solve problems 
or drive value. This is an understandable approach, but they must be 
careful not to create a tangle of initiatives that become increasingly 
difficult to track and compare.
Tracking expenditure and return on poorly integrated initiatives is even 
more pressing, given organizations expect to increase investment in 
AI over the next 12 months. Their top short-term goals for AI over the 
next year are to drive increased operational efficiency via automation, 
improve product and service development and innovation, and 
enhance pattern detection and issue correction. 
Data outlining customer behavior and feedback can help organizations 
understand where to apply AI for maximum effect. Salesforce’s 
Sumner raises the example of insurance, where automating contact 
points with customers worked well until policyholders wanted to 
notify their insurer of a loss. “Insurers were never able to get more 
than 10 percent of customers to do that online. They realized people 
were looking for human empathy.” This example shows how truly 
listening to customers can guide to the right path for delivering real 
value, and it’s a reminder that AI should be a tool or collaborator for 
human workers, rather than a replacement. 
Organizations should move away from disjointed AI use cases, and 
adopt a portfolio approach towards AI, focus on maximizing ROI while 
balancing innovation with risk mitigation.
Success that outlasts the hype will require 
consensus across the enterprise
The biggest barrier facing many organizations is moving from 
experimentation to production, says Naveen Zutshi, from Databricks. 
In scaling up an AI use case from a PoC to a more widespread 
production-level organizational practice, “the bottleneck is the 
confidence in the reliability, quality and safety of those AI models,” 
Zutshi says. “That comes back to data quality. You need to understand 
how the data is flowing: do you have sovereignty rights over the data, 
are you doing the right masking and encryption, and how are you 
looking at access controls right down to row and column level?”

Generative AI is introducing a brand-new risk vector to the tech 
domain, such as ‘hallucinations’, ‘jailbreaks’ and ‘adversarial 
prompting’ that can manipulate AI. The unexpected consequences 
of generated content have appeared seemingly frequently in 
the news this year. In light of this, when scaling emerging tech, 
organizations will need to have the governance and processes in 
place to control emerging risks. Survey respondents highlight the 
importance of continually developing AI governance policies for 
ethical and fair use in line with the evolving regulatory landscape. 
The process of establishing trusted guardrails and controls requires 
a multi-lens end-to-end secure approach to designing, building and 
deployment that incorporates coding best practice, code reviews, 
staff training and red teaming exercises that test the performance 
and reliability of AI models.
The ongoing AI hype may tempt organizations to make hurried 
decisions. However, successful AI adoption requires an enterprise-
wide multidisciplinary effort and a clear alignment across the 
enterprise, and a shared understanding of AI’s role and its potential. 
Organizations that can clearly define and communicate the value of AI 
to all stakeholders within the context of their business objectives, and 
execute through thoughtful collaboration, will have a greater chance of 
maximizing its impact across the enterprise.
As organizations embark on their AI transformation journeys, tech execs are at the forefront of navigating this complex and evolving 
landscape. In order to go beyond the hype and harness the potential of AI while balancing speed, risk, and value, they should focus on 
five key areas: 
Delivering value from AI: 
By aligning AI initiatives with overall business strategy, setting expectations for ROI, and allocating budget to AI transformation.
Unlocking AI capability: 
By upskilling teams to work with AI, setting up organizational governance structures, and identifying capabilities required 
across the business.
Building trust in AI: 
By identifying and addressing risks associated with AI, ensuring data quality and integrity, managing shadow AI and securing 
sensitive data used in AI.
Scaling AI with confidence: 
By deciding whether to build or buy AI capabilities, identifying suitable partners and vendors, and focusing on interoperability 
with existing IT infrastructure.
Architecting AI transformation: 
By engaging with the business and its various leaders to plan AI rollouts by value stream, function, or product, establishing an 
adoption roadmap, and integrating AI into existing business, digital, and tech strategies.

Conclusion and key recommendations
While the pace of digital transformation can 
be daunting, our research shows that many 
organizations are taking considerable strides 
forward in their implementation journeys, 
especially with AI, XaaS and cybersecurity.
The additional profitability that transformation has yielded so far is certainly 
encouraging and organizations are seeking value beyond profits. Execs are 
calibrating their digital transformation formulas to supercharge progress 
across a range of strategic objectives, including ESG responsibilities and 
customer experience elevation.
This year’s findings reveal that primary evidence, such as PoC tests and ROI, 
is taking precedence over a herd mentality. This empirical ethos will be integral 
to securing value and making wise choices, especially as tech execs try to 
balance the maintenance of legacy systems with a focus on new technology. 
To help guard against stakeholder skepticism associated with the safety and 
viability of new digital transformation opportunities, organizations should also 
bring structure, discipline and an enterprise mindset to the adoption of new 
technology, to mitigate risks and optimize value realization. 
The tech execs who make the superior decisions, safely steering their 
organization through various headwinds and risks, will be those that stay 
firmly rooted in a data-centric and value-led approach. These transformers 
will draw on both real-time and predictive data insights from a broad range 
of sources to make balanced judgment calls that align to the broader 
business and tech strategies, to drive sustainable value. 
Organizations that consistently 
demonstrate these behaviors 
can outpace their competition 
and unlock the potential of 
their technology investments, 
securing and growing market 
share as they do so.

Conclusion and key recommendations
Our respondents demonstrate that AI is already living up to the hype, with the majority of executives confirming they have already achieved business value from AI systems. To maintain momentum, organizations 
should reinforce their data management foundations. As AI PoC experiments are scaled up to production level, data integrity and reliability among other criteria, will dictate whether these innovations result in 
breakthroughs or costly setbacks. 
The attitudes and behaviors of high-performing organizations in this report provide many clues as to how to secure value from tech innovation.
Harness the 
power of 
partnership 
Resist being 
hypnotized by 
FOMO 
While a desire to 
progress and outpace 
your competition is 
healthy, do not let this 
boil over and distort your 
judgment. Rather than 
blindly following the herd, 
anchor decisions in your 
organization’s strategic 
objectives and look for 
tangible primary evidence 
of the right path to take.
Be empirical about 
deﬁning and 
delivering value 
Align stakeholders around a 
clear deﬁnition of success 
that cascades into a set of 
tangible metrics. Adopt an 
“always-on” approach to 
performance management 
and continuously monitor and 
adjust metrics in accordance 
with internal and external 
changes. These steps will help 
the organization to conﬁdently 
make decisions and deliver 
the value promised.
Mitigate 
technical debt
Embrace structured 
technical debt 
management. Establish 
clear remediation plans 
and robust architecture 
principles to contain and 
rationalize the technology 
landscape.
Innovation is not 
restricted to new 
technology. Explore new 
ways to collaborate, 
co-invest and share 
risk with your chosen 
partners. Use their 
networks to gain access 
to the latest technology 
and inventive ideas from 
around the globe.
Prioritize trust 
and security 
Ensure solutions are 
secure by design and 
embed trust and security 
assurance from the 
outset. Design, build, 
deploy and use AI and 
emerging tech solutions 
in a responsible and 
ethical manner so 
your organization can 
accelerate value with 
conﬁdence.
Build a strong 
data backbone 
Establish a robust data 
management framework 
that combines data, people, 
processes and policies 
to ensure information 
is reliable, relevant and 
appropriately used. Drive 
a shared understanding 
across the organization 
of how to harness data 
more effectively to support 
rapid and informed 
decision-making.
Develop AI 
proﬁciencies through
knowledge sharing
Test your workforce 
competence and 
sentiment on AI, and 
use this to determine 
the best way to bridge 
knowledge gaps, 
facilitate continuous 
learning and encourage 
cross-functional 
collaboration.
