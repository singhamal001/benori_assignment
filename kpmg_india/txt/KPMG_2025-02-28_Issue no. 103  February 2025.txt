Editorial
Ind AS 103, Business Combination provides 
guidance on accounting for business combinations 
under the acquisition method. Business 
combinations are transactions or events in which a 
reporting entity (acquirer) obtains control of one or 
more businesses (the acquiree). The date of 
acquisition is the date on which acquirer obtains 
control of the acquiree. Ind AS 103 provides the 
acquirer a time frame, referred to as the 
‘measurement period’, after the acquisition date to 
finalise its initial accounting of the business 
combination. An acquirer in a business 
combination is required to report provisional 
amounts when the measurements are incomplete 
at the end of the reporting period covering the 
business combination. This edition of Accounting 
and Auditing Update (AAU) includes an article to 
discuss the key aspects of the measurement 
period in a business combination. It discusses the 
use of provisional amounts, the accounting 
implications of adjustments made within this 
period, and the required disclosures in such 
situations.
The IFRS Sustainability Disclosure 
Standards IFRS S1, General Requirements for 
Disclosure of Sustainability-related Financial 
Information and IFRS S2, Climate-related 
Disclosures issued by the International 
Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) form the 
global baseline for sustainability-related 
disclosures. The standards require companies to 
provide a complete and balanced explanation of 
sustainability-related risks and opportunities. 
Companies disclose material information about the 
sustainability-related risks and opportunities that 
could reasonably be expected to affect an entity’s 
cash flows, its access to finance or its cost of 
capital over the short, medium, or long term. 
To support the implementation of IFRS 
Sustainability Disclosure Standards, in November 
2024, the ISSB issued an education material 
‘Sustainability-related risks and opportunities and 
the disclosure of material information’. The 
educational material provides guidance to help 
identify and disclose material information about 
sustainability-related risks and opportunities that 
are likely to affect an entity’s prospects. The article 
on this topic summarises the education material 
and discusses guidance related to identification 
and disclosure of material information.
There have been various regulatory developments 
in India and internationally during the month. 
Recently, the Securities and Exchange Board of 
India (SEBI) various notifications such as a 
consultation paper to review aspects relating to 
secretarial compliance report, appointment of 
auditors and Related Party Transactions (RPT). 
Additionally, SEBI issued a circular to provide 
Industry Standards Forum (ISF) to introduce 
standards for minimum information to be provided 
by listed entities for review by audit committee and 
shareholders for approval of RPTs. Subsequently, 
ISF introduced ‘Industry Standards on minimum 
information to be provided for review of the audit 
committee and shareholders for approval of RPT’. 
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) issued revised 
guidelines for Asset Reconstruction Companies 
(ARCs) to provide a structured and detailed 
framework for the settlement of dues by ARCs. 
Recently, the Institute of Chartered Accountants of 
India (ICAI) released its publication ‘Guidance on 
Non-Compliances Observed by Quality Review 
Board (QRB)’ to highlight common non-
compliances identified by the QRB and provides 
essential guidance to address these issues 
effectively. Our regulatory updates section covers 
these and other important regulatory 
developments.
We would be delighted to receive 
feedback/suggestions from you on the topics we 
should cover in the forthcoming editions of AAU.

CHAPTER 1
The measurement 
period in business 
combination
This article aims to:
• Discuss the key aspects around measurement period in a 
business combination.
Accounting and Auditing Update – February 2025
Ind AS 103, Business Combination provides 
guidance on accounting for business combinations 
under the acquisition method. Business 
combinations are transactions or events in which a 
reporting entity (acquirer) obtains control of one or 
more businesses (the acquiree). 
Business combinations are generally complex 
transactions and amongst the many challenges in 
accounting of these transactions, determining the 
fair values of acquiree’s assets liabilities and non-
controlling interest are particularly challenging 
when the business combination occurs shortly 
before the reporting period end or in situations 
where terms of business combination agreement 
are complex. Ind AS 103 provides an acquirer a 
time frame, referred to as the ‘measurement 
period’, to finalise its initial accounting of the 
business combination. In such situations, the 
acquirer is required to report provisional amounts 
for the items for which the accounting is 
incomplete, in its financial statements prepared 
during the measurement period. 
This article discusses the key aspects of 
measurement period, use of provisional amounts, 
accounting implications of adjustments made 
within the measurement period and the 
disclosures required.

What is measurement period?
Measurement period is the period after the 
acquisition date during which the acquirer may 
adjust the provisional amounts recognised for the 
business combination. Measurement period 
provides entities with a reasonable period of time 
to obtain the information necessary to identify and  
measure the following as of the acquisition date in 
accordance with the requirements of Ind AS 103:
The identifiable assets acquired, liabilities 
assumed and any non-controlling interest in the 
acquiree.
The consideration transferred for the acquiree 
(or other amount used in measuring goodwill)
The equity interest in the acquiree previously 
held by the acquirer if the business 
combination is achieved in stages
The resulting goodwill or gain on a 
bargain purchase

Ind AS 103 states that the measurement period ends as 
soon as the acquirer receives the information that it 
needs or learns that more information is not obtainable 
and such period cannot exceed one year from the 
acquisition date.
Is measurement period an open period?
06
Ind AS 103 does not provide specific guidance on determining 
provisional amounts. These amounts are determined based on the 
available information at the date of acquisition, consistent with the 
recognition and measurement requirements of the standard. Entities 
would be expected to make a reasonable effort to determine 
provisional amounts, and it would not be appropriate to assign only 
nominal amounts, or no amounts, solely because the acquirer 
anticipates it is likely to receive additional information about facts and 
circumstances that existed at the date of acquisition.
Ind AS 103 requires the acquirer to consider all pertinent factors in 
determining whether information obtained after the acquisition date 
would result in an adjustment to the provisional amounts recognised or 
whether that information results from events that occurred after the 
acquisition date. Some of the pertinent factors are: 
•
Date when additional information is obtained 
•
Whether the acquirer can identify a reason for a change to 
provisional amounts. 
Information obtained shortly after the acquisition date is more likely to 
reflect circumstances that existed at the acquisition date than the 
information obtained several months later. For example, unless an 
intervening event that changed its fair value can be identified, the sale 
of an asset to a third party shortly after the acquisition date for an 
amount that differs significantly from its provisional fair value measured 
at that date is likely to indicate an error in the provisional amount.
Thus, whether an event should be recognised as an adjustment to a 
provisional amount or as a post-combination event may involve 
significant judgement.
An example where an entity may report in its financial statements using 
provisional amounts during the measurement period would be when an 
entity has not obtained the final valuation report required to account for 
the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in an acquisition by the 
time it issues its financial statements for the first reporting period 
following the business combination. 
Measurement period adjustments may affect not only the measurement 
of assets and liabilities but also their recognition. There could also be 
situations where new information is obtained about facts and 
circumstances that existed at the date of acquisition that may result in 
recognition of additional assets or liabilities that were not recognised at 
the acquisition date In other words, new information might be obtained 
about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date, but 
that were unknown at that date. This may indicate additional assets or 
liabilities (including those arising from contingencies) not recognised in 
the initial accounting for an acquisition should be recognised as part of 
the accounting for the business combination.
What are provisional amounts?

Chapter 3
Until the accounting for a business combination is 
complete, the acquirer is required to disclose the 
following in its annual financial statements and in 
any interim financial statements:    
•
The reasons why the initial accounting for the 
business combination is incomplete
•
The assets, liabilities, equity interests or items 
of consideration for which the initial accounting 
is incomplete, and
•
The nature and amount of any measurement-
period adjustments recognised during the 
period.
Adjustment to provisional amounts 
Measurement-period adjustments are analogous 
to adjusting events after the reporting date under 
Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period i.e. 
events that occur after the reporting date but 
before the financial statements are authorised for 
issue and that provide evidence of a condition that 
existed at the reporting date .
Similarly, the effects of information that first 
becomes available during the measurement period 
and that provides evidence of conditions or 
circumstances that existed at the date of 
acquisition are reflected in the accounting at the 
date of acquisition – i.e. the adjustments are 
recognised retrospectively as if the accounting 
was completed at the date of acquisition. 
The acquirer revises its comparative information 
for prior periods presented in financial statements 
as needed, including making any change in 
depreciation, amortisation or other effects on 
comprehensive income that arise as a result of the 
adjustments.  
After the measurement period ends, the 
acquisition accounting is adjusted only to correct 
an error in accordance with Ind AS 8, Accounting 
Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and 
Errors.

These concepts are discussed by way of the following case studies:
Case Study 1
•
Company A acquires Company B on 28 February 2024. Company A seeks an independent valuation 
for an item of Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) acquired in the business combination.
•
The valuation for the said PPE was not complete by the time Company A issued its financial 
statements for the year ended 31 March 2024(*). 
•
In its financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2024, Company A recognised provisional fair 
value for such PPE, based upon information available, as INR30 crore. 
•
At the acquisition date, the said PPE had a remaining useful life of five years. 
•
Five months after the acquisition date, Company A received the independent valuation, which 
estimated the asset’s acquisition-date fair value as INR40 crore.
Evaluation of the measurement period adjustment in the financial statements for year ended 
31 March 2025:
In the year ended 31 March 2025, 
a) Company A would determine the measurement period adjustment of INR9.83 crore at the acquisition 
date as follows:
•
Fair value of INR40 crore less provisional value of INR30 crore i.e. INR10 crore less the additional 
depreciation that would have been recognised if the PPE was accounted at INR40 crore at the 
acquisition date (INR16.83 lakh for depreciation for a month).
b) Company A would retrospectively adjust the prior year information related to the acquisition of 
Company B as follows:
•
The carrying amount of PPE as at 31 March 2024 will increase by INR9.83 crore
•
The carrying amount of goodwill as at 31 March 2024 will decrease by INR10 crore
•
Depreciation expense for the year ended 31 March 2024 will increase by INR16.83 lakh.
c)
In accordance with paragraph B67(a) of Ind AS 103, Company A would disclose that the 
comparative information for the year ended 31 March 2024 is adjusted retrospectively to increase the 
fair value of the item of PPE at the acquisition date by INR9.83 crore, with a corresponding decrease 
in goodwill of INR10 crore and an increase in depreciation expense of INR16.83 lakh.
*It is pertinent to note that Company A in its financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2024 would disclose the reasons of why the initial accounting for PPE acquired in the business combination is incomplete.

Accounting and Auditing Update – February 2025
Distinguishing between new information about conditions that existed at the date of acquisition from 
Information that result from events that occur after the date of acquisition could have a significant impact 
on accounting of business combination. This assessment involves exercise of significant judgement. 
It is pertinent to note that measurement period does not provide an open one-year period following the 
acquisition date to complete the acquisition accounting. This is only to provide reasonable time to the 
acquirer to deal with accounting of complex business combination transaction and ends as soon as the 
acquirer receives the information it was seeking about facts and circumstances that existed as of the 
acquisition date or learns that more information is not available. In no circumstances should the 
measurement period exceed one year from the acquisition date.
As the standards do not provide elaborate guidance to determine provisional amounts, this requires 
companies to make reasonable efforts and significant judgement to determine these amounts 
appropriately based upon information available as at the acquisition date. Further, the entities should 
provide comprehensive disclosures about the items for which the business combination accounting has 
not been completed along with reasons and the nature and amount of any measurement-period 
adjustments recognised during the period.

Case Study 2
•
Company A acquires Company B on 28 February 2024
•
In its financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2024, Company A accounted for the assets 
acquired and liabilities assumed at provisional fair values
•
In April 2025, Company A obtained new information about facts and circumstances that existed as of 
the acquisition date that, if known, would have resulted in the recognition of an additional liability at 
that date.
Evaluation of the measurement period adjustment in the financial statements for year ended 
31 March 2025:
•
In this case, the measurement period ended on 28 February 2025 i.e. one year from the acquisition 
date
•
Management obtained the  new information about facts and circumstances that existed as at the 
acquisition date in April 2025 i.e. after the end of measurement period, and concluded that such 
adjustment is not resulting from an error in the business combination accounting
•
In this case, because the measurement period has ended and the adjustment resulting from the new 
information is not due to an error, Company A would not adjust the business combination accounting 
•
Instead, Company A would treat the new information as a subsequent event with respect to its 
financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2025. Accordingly, the financial statements for the 
year ended 31 March 2025 would reflect the effect of the adjustment resulting from the new 
information in financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2025 by recognising the additional 
liability through a charge to Statement of profit and loss.

Chapter 3
In continuation of our previous article in January 2025 edition, this article aims to discuss the guidance related to identification and disclosing of material information.
With an aim to support the implementation of first two IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards (the ISSB standards):
•
IFRS S1, General Requirements for Disclosure of Sustainability-related Financial Information (IFRS S1)
•
IFRS S2, Climate-related Disclosures (IFRS S2)
In November 2024, the ISSB issued an education material ‘Sustainability-related risks and opportunities and the disclosure of material information’. The standards require companies to disclose material 
information about the sustainability-related risks and opportunities that could reasonably be expected to affect entity’s prospects. The educational material explains the requirements related to identifying and 
disclosing material information about sustainability-related risks and opportunities that could reasonably be expected to affect an entity’s prospects. 
The educational material is structured into three sections:
•
Chapter 1: The definition of material information and its application in ISSB standards: Discusses the main components of the definition of ‘material information’ to enable an understanding of the use of 
this term and how to make materiality judgements in that context. 
•
Chapter 2: Sustainability-related risks and opportunities that could reasonably be expected to affect an entity’s prospects and its application in ISSB standards: Discusses what sustainability-related 
risks and opportunities are and how they could reasonably be expected to affect an entity’s prospects to enable an understanding of how this concept is used in ISSB standards. 
•
Chapter 3: Identifying and disclosing material information: Discusses the requirements associated with identifying and disclosing material information about sustainability-related risks and opportunities that 
could reasonably be expected to affect an entity’s prospects. 
In our previous edition of Accounting and Auditing Update January 2025, we have discussed the guidance related to identification of sustainability-related risks and opportunities. The subsequent section discusses 
guidance related to identification and disclosing of material information.

Chapter 3
The standard requires entities to provide material information about an entity’s sustainability-related risks and opportunities to help meet the information needs of primary users. The information is considered 
material when omitting, misstating or obscuring that information could reasonably be expected to influence primary users’ decisions. However, the distinct scope of the reported information including differences in 
relevant time horizons and the types of information required to meet the respective objectives of sustainability-related financial disclosures and the related financial statements requires that distinct materiality 
judgements should be used for those disclosures and for the related financial statements.
In relation to definition of ‘material information’, the education material provides following guidance relating to main components of the definition:
•
Information needs of primary users and the decisions they make based on general purpose financial reports: Materiality judgements involve considerations relating to both who the primary users are 
and what decisions they make based on general purpose financial reports. General purpose financial reports do not, and cannot, provide all the information that all primary users need. Therefore, an entity 
should meet the common information needs of primary users. Additionally, an entity assesses whether information is material based on whether that information could reasonably be expected to influence 
decisions of primary users. Although the entity itself makes this assessment, it is based on the perspective of primary users and their information needs. The materiality assessment requires an entity to consider 
the characteristics of primary users (such as, potential investors), while also considering the entity’s own circumstances (for example, the entity’s own industry). 
•
In the context of sustainability-related financial disclosures: Sustainability-related financial disclosures provide information about an entity’s sustainability related risks and opportunities that is useful to 
primary users of general-purpose financial reports in making decisions about providing resources to the entity. Although the definition of ‘material information’ in ISSB Standards is aligned with the definition of 
the same term in IFRS Accounting Standards, however, the information required to meet the objective of the respective general purpose financial reports is distinct. The materiality judgements an entity makes 
in preparing its sustainability-related financial disclosures will be distinct from those it makes in preparing its financial statements.
•
Meaning of ‘omitting, misstating or obscuring’ information: In assessing whether information is material, an entity considers the effect of omitting, misstating or obscuring that information on primary users’ 
decisions. An entity is required to identify its sustainability-related financial disclosures clearly and distinguish them from other information the entity provides. Therefore, an entity should ensure that 
sustainability-related financial disclosures are clearly identifiable and not obscured by additional information.

material information, November 2024)
Step 1: Identify information about sustainability-related risks and 
opportunities that has the potential to be material
Considering the requirements of ISSB standards, the education material states that as first step an entity 
should identify information about its sustainability-related risks and opportunities that primary users might 
need to understand to make decisions relating to providing resources to the entity. Once the entity has 
identified a sustainability-related risk or opportunity, an entity should apply the ISSB Standard 
requirements that specifically applies to identified sustainability-related risk or opportunity. Further, an 
entity should apply IFRS S2 in combination with IFRS S1, for example, if an entity identifies a climate-
related risk or opportunity then in determining the required level of disaggregation of climate-related 
information to provide, an entity should refer to the relevant requirements in IFRS S1.
The education material also highlights that the disclosure requirements in ISSB Standards specify items 
of information that an entity is required to provide if that information is material in the entity’s 
circumstances. The information to be provided should be useful to primary users in making decisions 
about providing resources to the entity. If an entity determines that information required by an ISSB 
Standard is not material, the entity need not disclose that information. In case, ISSB standard does not 
provide disclosure requirements relating to an entity’s identified sustainability-related risk or opportunity, 
in such scenarios IFRS S1 requires that an entity apply judgement to identify information that is:
• Relevant to primary users’ decision-making; and
• Faithfully represents the sustainability-related risk or opportunity. 
In applying such judgement, an entity needs to assess what information is useful to primary users. 
Further, to help an entity in assessing whether the information is relevant and faithfully represents the 
identified risk or opportunity, IFRS S1 specifies sources of guidance for the identification of relevant and 
hence, potentially material information.
The output of Step 1 is a set of potentially material information.

Accounting and Auditing Update – February 2025
Step 2: Assess whether the potentially material information identified in 
Step 1 is material
The education material highlights that in Step 2, an entity assesses whether the potentially material 
information identified in Step 1 is, in fact, material. Considering that materiality judgements are specific to 
the entity, ISSB Standards do not specify any thresholds for material information or predetermine what 
information would be material in a particular situation.
When making materiality judgements, an entity considers whether the item of information could 
reasonably be expected to affect primary users’ assessment of the amount, timing and uncertainty of 
future net cash inflows to the entity and their assessment of stewardship of the entity’s economic 
resources sufficiently to influence their decisions. The education material highlights that following points 
should be considered when making materiality judgements:
•
Consideration of quantitative and qualitative factors: An entity should assess the materiality of 
information by considering both quantitative and qualitative factors, it would not be appropriate to rely 
on purely numerical guidelines or to apply a uniform quantitative threshold for all materiality 
judgements. Below are some of the considerations:
o Quantitative factors: An entity ordinarily assesses whether information is quantitatively material by 
considering the size of the effect of the sustainability-related risk or opportunity against other 
related measures. Examples of quantitative factors might include impact on cash flows, amount of 
resource consumption, return on investment or market share. A quantitative factor can be used to 
assess both the materiality of quantitative information, such as GHG emissions, and also 
qualitative information, such as qualitative information about an entity’s resilience to a specific 
sustainability-related risk.
o Qualitative factors: Qualitative factors, on other hand, are factors that an entity considers in making 
materiality judgements related to characteristic of the entity, such as its governance, and its 
interactions with its stakeholders, society, the economy and the natural environment throughout the 
entity’s value chain, that ultimately give rise to sustainability-related risks or opportunities. The 
ISSB standards highlights that existence of qualitative factor more likely to influence the decisions 
of primary users. Therefore, when making materiality judgements, an entity should consider both 
entity-specific and external qualitative factors. The table on next column discusses some examples 
of both entity-specific and external qualitative factors qualitative factors.
•
The nature of the risk or opportunity
•
The extent to which the entity’s business model 
and strategy depend on particular resources or 
relationships—for example, relationships with 
important suppliers or customers
•
Unexpected variation or change in trends. 
Entity-specific qualitative factors
•
The entity’s geographical location 
•
The entity’s industry or sector
•
The state of the economy or economies in 
which the entity operates.
External qualitative factors
While determining whether information is material, an entity considers both quantitative and qualitative 
factors, however. the presence of a qualitative factor is likely to lower the threshold for a quantitative 
assessment. The more significant the qualitative factors, the more likely it is that lower quantitative 
thresholds will apply. While, in some circumstances a quantitative threshold could be reduced to zero 
and the information would still be material as it is expected to influence primary users’ decisions. Thus, 
an entity needs to identify information as material based on one or more quantitative or qualitative 
factors.
•
Consideration of possible future events with uncertain outcomes: When assessing whether 
information about events is material, IFRS S1 requires an entity to consider the range of possible 
outcomes and the likelihood of the possible outcomes. When considering possible outcomes, an entity is 
required to consider all pertinent facts and circumstances. An entity is more likely to conclude that 
information about a possible future event is material if the potential effects are significant and the event 
is likely to occur.  Information about a possible future event that is expected to affect an entity’s cash 
flows many years in the future is less likely to be material than information about a possible future event 
with similar effects that has the possibility of occurring sooner.

Step 3: Organise the information within the draft sustainability-related 
financial disclosures
An entity should organise a preliminary set of material information in the draft sustainability-related 
financial disclosures in a way that communicates information clearly and concisely to primary users. An 
entity needs to exercise judgement while organising material information, including those related to: 
•
Aggregating and disaggregating information: An entity is required to consider all facts and 
circumstances and decide how to aggregate and disaggregate information in its sustainability-related 
financial disclosures. While aggregating an entity should consider that aggregating would not obscure 
information that is material and aggregated items only if information has shared characteristics. 
Further, the entity might need to disaggregate information about sustainability-related risks and

Obscuring information: IFRS S1 requires an entity to clearly identify its sustainability-related 
financial disclosures and distinguish these disclosures from other information so it cannot obscure 
material information.
The output of Step 3 is the draft sustainability-related financial disclosures.

Consideration of changed circumstances and assumptions: An entity should make new, and 
reassess old, materiality judgements at each reporting date, considering changed circumstances and 
assumptions. Such changes can relate to changes in the entity’s individual circumstances or in the 
external environment. Changed circumstances and assumptions might impact materiality of the 
information included in sustainability-related financial disclosures. An entity is required to reassess its 
materiality judgements at each reporting date to consider any changes in circumstances and 
assumptions. If an entity is exposed to a sustainability-related risk or opportunity that might have 
consequences in the long term, the entity should disclose the material information about this 
sustainability-related risk or opportunity.
The output of Step 2 is a preliminary set of material information.
•
Disclosing material information: If an entity concludes that information that is necessary to enable 
primary users to understand the effects of a sustainability-related risk or opportunity on the entity’s 
prospects is material, then an entity should disclose such information, regardless of whether it is 
specifically required by an ISSB Standard. An entity makes judgements about whether this 
information is material in the same way it makes judgements about other types of information that is, 
based on the expectation of whether the information could reasonably be expected to influence 
primary users’ decisions.

Step 4: Review the draft sustainability-related financial disclosures
As a last step, the entity ‘steps back’ and considers its sustainability-related financial disclosures as a 
whole to ensure that it has complied with the requirements related to connected information, such as 
whether primary users will understand connections between the disclosures in its sustainability-related 
financial disclosures and other disclosures that are part of general-purpose financial reports. 
An entity assesses whether information is material both individually and in combination with other 
information in the context of its whole sustainability-related financial disclosures. The following chart 
summarises considerations an entity might make while reviewing draft sustainability-related financial 
disclosures:
The output of Step 4 is the final sustainability-related financial disclosures.
In performing this review, the entity 
considers whether:
The review might lead to:
Additional information being provided in the 
sustainability-related financial disclosures.
Greater aggregation or disaggregation of 
information.
Information that is identified as immaterial being 
removed from the sustainability-related financial 
disclosures to avoid obscuring material information.
Information being reorganised within the 
sustainability-related financial disclosures.
All relevant relationships between different items of 
information have been identified. Identifying new 
relationships between information might lead to that 
information being identified as material for the first 
time.
Items of information that are individually immaterial, 
when considered together, could nevertheless 
reasonably be expected to influence primary users’ 
decisions.
The information in the sustainability-related financial 
disclosures is communicated in an effective, 
understandable way, and organised to avoid 
obscuring material information.
The sustainability-related financial disclosures 
provide a fair presentation of the entity’s 
sustainability-related risks and opportunities.
(Source: ISSB’s Education material: Sustainability-related risks and opportunities and the disclosure of 
material information, November 2024)
The review of draft sustainability disclosures might lead an entity to reconsider its assessment in and 
decide to reassess some information, which might conclude that information previously identified as 
material and remove it from its sustainability-related financial disclosures.

When applying ISSB Standards, an entity is 
required to provide information in a manner that 
enables primary users to understand the 
connections between disclosures provided across 
its sustainability-related financial disclosures and 
its related financial statements. In addition, an 
entity needs to consider materiality in context of 
sustainability-related financial disclosures. ISSB 
Standards are designed to result in an entity 
providing information that is useful for the primary 
users of general-purpose financial reports. 
The entities reporting in accordance with ISSB 
Standards should consider developing a process 
to identify and disclose material information about 
the sustainability-related risks and opportunities it 
has identified and to ensure that it has complied 
with the requirements of ISSB standards.

On 7 February 2025, the Securities Exchange 
Board of India (SEBI) issued a consultation paper 
to review aspects relating to secretarial compliance 
report, appointment of auditors and Related Party 
Transactions (RPT) of a listed entity (the 
consultation paper). The consultation paper seeks 
public feedback on proposed amendments to the 
SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure 
Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (LODR 
Regulations) and SEBI (Share Based Employee 
Benefits and Sweat Equity) Regulations, 2021 
(SBEBS Regulations) and is open for comments 
until 28 February 2025.
The key amendments  proposed are as follows:
1. Strengthening the secretarial compliance 
report: Regulation 24A(2) of the LODR 
Regulations requires every listed entity to submit 
a secretarial compliance report to stock 
exchanges every year in the specified format. 
However, to enhance secretarial compliance by 
listed entities, SEBI proposed following 
amendments relating to secretarial audit and 
secretarial compliance report:
a) Disclosure of Annual Secretarial Compliance 
Report (ASCR) in the annual report 
b) Mandatory compliance with secretarial 
standards referred under Section 118(10) of 
the Companies Act, 2013 (2013 Act)
c) Change in or resignation of a secretarial 
auditor will be deemed to be a material event 
requiring disclosure without application of 
materiality guidelines as per Schedule III of 
the LODR Regulations
d) Total fees paid by listed entity and its 
subsidiaries to a secretarial auditor along with 
the fact about the resignation or removal of a 
secretarial auditor before end of tenure with 
reasons thereof to be disclosed in the annual 
report as per Schedule V of the LODR 
Regulations
e) Removal of duplication in certifications 
between ASCR and requirements in other 
SEBI Regulations.
2. Eligibility criteria for appointment of 
statutory auditor and disclosure to audit 
committee and board of directors: Regulation 
36(5) of the LODR Regulations outlines specific 
disclosure requirements for the notice to be sent 
to shareholders for an annual general meeting 
when appointing or re-appointing statutory or 
secretarial auditors. However, considering that 
the current requirement does not specify the 
standardised format for these disclosures and 
does not mandate minimum information 
disclosure to the Audit Committee or Board of 
Directors, SEBI proposed to prescribe the format 
for disclosure of minimum information to the 
Audit Committee and/or Board of Directors, 
shareholders of the listed entity for considering 
appointment or re-appointment of statutory or 
secretarial auditors of the listed entity. 
3. Approval of RPTs undertaken by subsidiaries 
of listed entity: Regulation 23(2) of the LODR 
requires prescribes ‘approval requirements’ 
relating to RPT involving a subsidiary of a listed 
entity. However, to further clarify the applicability 
of monetary thresholds, SEBI proposed to 
introduce monetary thresholds of INR1,000 crore 
for audit committee approval of RPTs in addition 
to the existing percentage-based threshold (10 
per cent of the annual standalone turnover) 
where the lower of the two thresholds (monetary 
or percentage-based) will be used to determine 
the need for audit committee approval. In case of 
SME listed entities, INR50 crore threshold would 
be applicable. 
Additionally, in case of subsidiaries which do not 
have financial track record i.e. published 
financial statements for at least one year, it is 
proposed to consider 10 per cent of the certified 
net worth on standalone basis instead of10 per 
cent of standalone turnover, as the threshold for 
audit committee approval. In cases of negative 
net worth, the share capital plus securities 
premium will be considered as the threshold 
instead of net worth. This threshold would be 
compared with INR 1,000 crore (or INR50 crore) 
i.e. lower of monetary threshold and percentage-
based threshold, may be considered for 
approval of RPTs by an audit committee. 
4. Clarifications pertaining to applicability of 
RPT provisions: Regulation 2(1)(zc) of the 
LODR Regulations defines an RPT as any 
transaction between a listed entity (or its 
subsidiaries) and a related party of the listed 
entity (or its subsidiaries). In this regard, SEBI 
received requests for clarification on how this 
definition applies to subsidiaries of listed entities 
for RPT compliance. Considering that, SEBI 
proposed to provide following clarifications:
i. To determine related parties for subsidiaries - 
definition of RPT (Regulation 2(1)(zc)) should 
be read along with definition of a related party 
(Regulation 2(1)(zb)) 
ii. The exemption under Regulation 23(5)(b) will 
apply only when the wholly owned 
subsidiary’s accounts are consolidated with a 
listed holding company and presented to 
shareholders. Further, SEBI proposes to 
clarify that the exemption applies only to listed 
holding companies.

Recently, SEBI issued the ‘Industry Standards 
Recognition Manual’ to outline guidelines for 
recognising industry standards to facilitate 
compliance with regulatory directions for various 
regulated entities like Market Infrastructure 
Institutions (MIIs), Mutual Funds, and listed 
companies and it provides for the creation and 
regulation of Industry Standards Forums (ISFs) to 
develop specific standards, checklists, and 
Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for 
implementation of the various regulatory 
directions. 
Key points of the manual include:
•
Scope of ISF: Formulating standards for 
regulatory compliance, not drafting regulations 
or taking regulatory actions.
•
Constitution of ISF: Comprising members of 
the concerned industry or regulated entities, 
including small and medium-sized players, with 
a chairperson having at least 10 years of 
relevant experience.
•
Functioning of ISF: Preparing of 
implementation standards in consultations with 
SEBI for the identified regulatory directive 
and/or suggest additional directives for framing 
of standards. 
•
Recognition process: Standards must be 
specific, aligned with regulatory intent, and 
include step-by-step implementation 
procedures.
•
Publishing standards: Recognised standards 
would be published on SEBI and industry 
association websites and must be adopted by 
regulated entities.
The manual aims to ensure uniformity and ease of 
compliance while allowing SEBI to modify 
guidelines as needed.

Regulation 23 of the SEBI LODR Regulations 
require Related Party Transactions (RPTs) to be 
approved by the audit committee and by the 
shareholders, if material. Additionally, Part A and 
Part B of Section III-B of the SEBI Master Circular 
dated 11 November 2024 (Master Circular) specify 
the information that should be placed before the 
audit committee and shareholders, respectively, 
for consideration of RPTs. Considering these 
requirements, SEBI on 14 February 2025 issued a 
circular, wherein it has provided that, the Industry 
Standards Forum1 (ISF) to introduce standards for 
minimum information to be provided for review by 
an audit committee and shareholders for approval 
of RPTs which will enable listed entities comply 
with requirements of LODR Regulations and SEBI 
Master circular.
Considering the circular, ISF introduced ‘Industry 
Standards on minimum information to be provided 
for review of the audit committee and shareholders 
for approval of RPT’. The standards provide a 
standard format for listed entities to provide 
minimum information to the audit committee and 
shareholders for RPTs entered into on or after 
1 April 2025. The industry standard covers the 
following aspects:
1. Applicability: The standards are applicable to 
material RPTs as defined under the SEBI 
LODR Regulations and where the 
transaction(s) to be entered into individually or 
taken together with previous transactions during 
a financial year, exceed lower of the following: 
a) Two per cent of turnover, as per the last 
audited consolidated financial statements of 
the listed entity
b) Two per cent of net worth, as per the last 
audited consolidated financial statements of 
the listed entity, except in case the arithmetic 
value of the net worth is negative
c) Five per cent of the average of absolute 
value of profit or loss after tax, as per the last 
three audited consolidated financial 
statements of the listed entity. 
2. Minimum information: Specifies minimum 
information required for audit committee’s and 
shareholders’ review and approval of RPTs.
3. Format for information: Provides standardised 
format for presentation of information to the 
audit committee.

In May 2024, SEBI issued a master circular for 
Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) 
Rating Providers (ERPs). The master circular 
mandates ERPs to monitor significant 
developments or events that could alter the ESG 
profile of a rated company. Such events include 
the publication of the Business Responsibility and 
Sustainability Report (BRSR) or any controversies 
and penalties related to ESG areas. ERPs are 
required to review ESG ratings immediately, but 
no later than 10 days after such events.
However, stakeholders have raised concerns 
about the feasibility of reviewing ESG ratings for 
numerous listed companies within the 10 days 
timeframe following the publication of the BRSR. 
Considering these challenges and aiming to 
facilitate ease of doing business, SEBI issued a 
circular on 17 January 2025 to extend the review 
timeline for ESG ratings following the publication 
of the BRSR to 45 days.
This extension is expected to provide ERPs with 
sufficient time to conduct thorough reviews and 
ensuring more accurate and reliable ESG ratings.

Asset reconstruction companies (ARCs) play a 
crucial role in the financial system by taking over 
Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) from banks, 
allowing lenders to focus on core banking 
activities. However, ARCs often face challenges in 
recovering dues from borrowers, making 
settlements a common solution. 
Considering the challenges, on 20 January 2025, 
the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) introduced 
revised guidelines to prescribe more structured 
and detailed framework for the settlement of dues 
by ARCs. Key changes include:
1.
Board approved settlement policy: 
The requirement for a board-approved policy 
covering specific aspects of settlement, such 
as cut-off date for one-time settlement 
eligibility, methodology for arriving at the 
realisable value of the security, etc.
2.
Settlement procedure: The criteria for 
settlement of dues are now divided into three 
categories:
a) Principal amounts exceeding INR1 crore: 
Requires forming the Independent Advisory 
Committee (IAC) consisting of professionals 
having technical/finance/legal background. 
Borrowers with outstanding dues exceeding 
INR1 crore, settlement proposal is to be 
reviewed by IAC and recommendations of 
IAC to be considered by the Board of the 
ARC with at least two independent directors. 
The Board must contemplate every avenue 
of recovery before it allows and orders 
settlement.
b) Principal amounts are less than equal to 
INR1 crore: Settlement of accounts to be 
done as per the criteria prescribed by the 
authority in the Board-approved policy, 
subject to specified conditions.
c) Dues from borrowers classified as frauds 
or wilful defaulters: Settlement of accounts 
to be done under same procedures as 
settlement of accounts where principal 
amount exceeds INR1 crore, irrespective of 
value. An ARC may settle without prejudice 
to any criminal action that might be pending 
against such borrowers.
3.
Other legal provisions: All settlements must 
comply with existing laws and regulations. If 
recovery proceedings are ongoing in a judicial 
forum, any settlement must obtain a consent 
decree from the relevant judicial authority.

The SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) 
Regulations, 2012 (AIF Regulations) provide 
guidelines to regulate private pools of capital in 
India. Recently, SEBI issued a consultation paper 
to review Regulation 17(a) of AIF Regulations. 
The paper addresses concerns about the 
shrinking investment opportunities in unlisted debt 
securities due to recent amendments in the LODR 
Regulations, which mandate the listing of non-
convertible debt securities. The key proposals 
include allowing Category II AIFs to invest more 
than 50 per cent of their investible funds in either 
unlisted securities or listed debt securities with a 
credit rating of 'A' or below. 
This aims to expand the investment universe for 
AIFs while maintaining their role in providing 
capital to industries lacking access to traditional 
funding sources. The consultation paper is open 
for comments until 28 February 2025.

Standards Board (ISSB) issued, IFRS S1, General 
Requirements for Disclosure of Sustainability-
related Financial Information and IFRS S2, 
Climate-related Disclosures which provide 
requirements related to disclosure of sustainability-
related risks and opportunities, including those 
related to climate, for capital markets. With an aim 
to aid companies in implementing these standards, 
The IFRS Foundation has published a new 
guide, Applying IFRS S1 when reporting only 
climate-related disclosures in accordance with 
IFRS S2, which aims to help companies 
understand how to report only climate-related 
information when applicable using International 
Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) Standards. 
Further, in response to the concerns about data 
availability and readiness, the ISSB introduced 
transition reliefs in IFRS S1 and IFRS S2. As per 
ISSB standards, companies must apply both 
standards together, but paragraph E5 of IFRS S1 
allows them to disclose only climate-related risks 
and opportunities in the first year, following the 
'climate-first' approach.
This transition relief temporarily narrows the scope 
of reporting in accordance with IFRS S1 from the 
requirements of information about all sustainability 
related risks and opportunities that could 
reasonably be expected to affect a company’s 
prospects to the provision of information about only 
climate-related risks and opportunities, giving 
companies time to prepare reports on all 
sustainability related risks and opportunities. 
However, this relief is optional and in case, 
companies have the resources to do so, they may 
report on all sustainability matters as well.
