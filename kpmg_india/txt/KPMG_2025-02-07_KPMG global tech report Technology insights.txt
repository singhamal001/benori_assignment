Executive summary
The digital transformation journey is an important strategic  
consideration for all sectors, none more so than technology. 
This means the tech sector has to do two things simultaneously: 
lead by example and rethink its own strategies. 
Yet, like all industries, the tech sector also faces challenges —  
and opportunities — in the rapidly evolving tech landscape. For 
example, the KPMG 2024 Technology and Telecommunications 
CEO Outlook showed that, in 2024, a top-three challenge for 
tech and telecommunications CEOs has been the adoption of 
generative AI.1 
The tech sector’s position ahead of other sectors can be 
attributed to its formula for success. Much of the tech sector’s 
accomplishments are the result of discipline and targeted 
investments. Through strategic spending decisions, such as 
the prioritization of AI and environmental, social and governance 
(ESG) activities, the industry has become skilled at protecting its 
transformation progress from volatility. 
This and other valuable insights are provided in our Global 
Tech Report 2024 — a survey of 2,450 executives from 
26 countries, including 490 leaders from the tech sector. 
Tech stands strong against headwinds, but higher expectations for the sector mean 
that it is required to respond with clarity and strategic investments.
Executive summary
Key findings
The tech sector is targeting profitability
This year’s survey reveals an increase in the number  
of tech professionals who say that technology has directly 
improved their organization’s profitability over the past 24 
months. Some of the most notable growth in profitability, 
with increases of 10 percentage points or more, has 
resulted from efforts in AI, data and analytics, everything-
as-a-service (XaaS), cyber security and modern delivery.
ESG goals are a key focus for tech’s 
digital investments
Today’s tech organizations are recognizing the importance 
of using tech for good. About three-quarters of tech 
executives report that their tech investments directly target 
their sustainability and social responsibility goals, 
surpassing the cross-sector average. 
Tech sector plans to maintain 
a democratized approach 
with AI experiments
Most sectors are working toward a centralized approach 
to AI implementation. But the tech sector plans to 
continue developing AI governance policies and 
experimentation practices in a democratized way as it 
builds more experience in this rapidly developing area.

The tech sector is targeting profitability
Today’s macroeconomic and geopolitical landscape might be turbulent, 
but tech companies are continuing to fund digital innovation with 
confidence and commitment. There are good reasons for this: three-
quarters of tech executives (76 percent) say their total cost of 
ownership and cost–benefit forecasts are usually accurate. Roughly 
the same proportion say they run calculations to forecast the potential 
value of a technology before they invest, a figure that is slightly above 
the cross-sector average. 
As a result, tech is one of the sectors most likely in our survey to feel 
confident in its ability to manage expenditure so that hidden costs do 
not disrupt the digital transformation. 
Mark Gibson, Global Head of Technology, Media & Telecommunications, 
KPMG International and Line of Business Leader for Technology, Media 
& Telecommunications, KPMG in the US, says we are seeing a shift in 
how tech companies spend their money. “We’re seeing a much stronger 
focus on outcomes than we did before,” says Gibson. “It used to be all 
about how much they could invest in research and development, but as 
tech companies mature, priorities are shifting.” 
Gibson says that profitability is paramount in today’s economy: “It’s a 
constant seesaw between wanting to invest in innovation and needing to 
keep costs down. That’s why most tech firms are now on a journey of 
targeted investment in key transformation areas.”
This year’s survey shows an 
increase in the number of 
tech professionals who say 
that technology has directly 
improved their 
organization’s profitability 
over the past 
24 months. 
There is notable growth in 
profitability, with increases 
of 10 percentage points or 
more from efforts in AI, 
data and analytics, XaaS, 
cyber security and modern 
delivery methods.

Case study
Sierra Wireless
Helping to ensure trust in IoT solutions
As a major global IoT solutions provider, Sierra Wireless utilizes 
manufacturing facilities around the world — delivering innovative 
technologies that are enhancing operational efficiencies and customer 
experiences for some of the world’s leading organizations.
The Canadian-based multinational, which is particularly proud of its nearly    
30-year record of building trusted client relationships across an array of 
industries, was forced to take decisive action as its operations, including 
manufacturing, were temporarily disrupted in March 2021 by a ransomware 
attack on the company’s internal IT systems and corporate website.
Sierra Wireless immediately countered the attack — turning to KPMG firms’ 
cyber-incident response specialists from Canada and the UK to assist with 
response and recovery efforts.
Sierra Wireless leaders worked closely with KPMG’s cyber professionals to 
resolve the root cause of the ransomware attack and contain and recover 
the disrupted operations. As part of the larger recovery effort, KPMG in 
Canada and KPMG in the UK were able to prioritize and recover Sierra’s 
manufacturing operations within days. In the wake of the incident, KPMG 
and Sierra Wireless professionals worked together to enhance Sierra’s IT 
operations and cyber-security program. 
Sierra Wireless’ IoT solutions help customers in industries such as 
transportation, healthcare, industrial manufacturing, and energy transform 
and thrive in today’s connected economy. The timely actions taken in 
response to this incident helped maintain the trust of these customers in the 
security of Sierra Wireless’ IoT solutions.

And perhaps a direct result of using tech for good is the industry’s 
progress in addressing environmental, social and governance (ESG) 
issues. In fact, our recent KPMG 2024 Technology and 
Telecommunications CEO Outlook showed that the number of tech 
and telecommunications CEOs who are confident about reaching 
their net-zero goals by 2030 has increased from 36 percent in 2023 
to 46 percent in 2024. A large part of this optimism comes from the 
sector’s transformation of how data centers are built and run — and 
their impact on the environment.
ESG efforts are particularly important to the tech sector’s workforce. 
As Gibson emphasizes, “In tech, employees have high expectations 
for each of the three areas of ESG. Not only do they want to see 
thoughtfulness around environmental impact, but they also hold the 
industry responsible for the way in which information is spread — 
particularly around key social and political issues.” 
The good news is that KPMG research confirms that tech 
organizations are taking their employees’ opinions seriously, with 
tech being one of the sectors most likely to prioritize tech 
investments based on employee feedback (5 percentage points 
above the global average). 
This has important implications for the ‘governance’ part of ESG as 
organizations work to ensure they have both the right policies in 
place to address ESG challenges and the ability to be a voice for their 
workforce. According to Gibson, the tech sector has a huge 
responsibility related to cyber protection and the way in which the 
sector manages and shares information. “ESG is about the future of 
the industry from a people perspective,” he says. “That’s why tech 
organizations must focus on protecting people’s data and having the 
processes and controls in place to build consumer trust as part of 
their formulas to getting ESG right.”

Tech firms plan to keep a democratized

Tech firms plan to keep a democratized 
approach with AI experiments
Appetite for AI is growing across all sectors, and many companies are taking a 
democratized approach while they encourage their workforces to find new ways 
to use it. But as they scale AI, while keeping governance, trust and security at 
the center, most sectors are switching to a more centralized approach.
Here, the tech sector bucks the trend, as centralization is not on the roadmap. Instead, tech companies 
plan to maintain their democratized approach to AI experimentation, while continually developing their AI 
governance policies as they build more experience in the area. 
Gibson notes, “We want everyone in a tech company experimenting and using AI daily. Yet, it’s important 
to balance this with a centralized governance layer so companies have a framework for their workforces to 
operate within. This should allow tech companies the space to continuously adapt and refine their AI 
strategies while protecting their values, security and customers.”
According to our KPMG global tech report 2024, successful AI implementation will require the tech sector 
to take a systemic approach2 that is based on cross-functional effort. From building strategic frameworks 
to upskilling teams and identifying risks, tech is uniquely positioned to lead the way across this new 
frontier with confidence. 
The earlier you appoint a chief artificial intelligence officer (CAIO),  
the easier it is to shape and coordinate the transformation before 
business units and functions have invested in similar capabilities.  
In addition, first movers may secure scarce CAIO talent in the external  
or internal market before they become even more in demand.3

Key recommendations
To lead by example while fostering innovation, tech executives should:
• Prioritize trust and security in the initial phases of designing 
solutions. With tech rapidly evolving, designing and building 
solutions in a responsible way is now more important than ever. 
Including cyber security experts at the start of every project can 
enhance trust and protect brand reputation. It can also help 
minimize the risk of data breaches and the need for costly 
retrofitting of security fixes.
• Turn ESG into a competitive advantage by implementing embedded 
strategies that address environmental and social risks while 
capitalizing on commercial opportunities. As technology plays a 
crucial role4 in integrating ESG into strategic processes, the tech 
sector has an opportunity to thrive and make a real difference in this 
space. To do so, it needs to improve its own processes while also 
building solutions that help other sectors do better. 
• Lead successful AI adoption by ensuring that all departments work 
together and AI value is communicated clearly and with a strong 
connection to departmental business objectives. To help the sector 
move beyond the AI hype, KPMG has identified five key areas for 
organizations to focus on: delivering value, unlocking capabilities, 
building trust, scaling with confidence and architecting 
transformation. Our global tech report elaborates on each of these. 
In line with the KPMG 2024 Technology and Telecommunications CEO 
Outlook5, this research shows that there is optimism about growth in 
the tech sector. To navigate new technologies such as generative AI 
alongside environmental and economic challenges, tech companies 
will have to remain disciplined and strategic during their 
transformation journeys.
