In the rapidly evolving landscape of industrial manufacturing (IM), 
organizations are increasingly recognizing the imperative of digital 
transformation to enhance operational efficiency, quality control, and 
sustainability. The KPMG global tech report highlights that industrial 
manufacturing firms are at the forefront of this transformation, 
showcasing the highest levels of digital maturity across various 
technology categories compared to other sectors. This report 
serves as a critical resource for understanding the current state of 
digital adoption in industrial manufacturing and the strategic steps 
necessary for continued advancement.
The research conducted by KPMG surveyed 2,450 executives 
from 26 countries, including 368 leaders from the industrial 
manufacturing sector. The findings reveal that 76 percent of 
industrial manufacturing firms express a strong willingness to 
embrace cutting-edge technology, the highest among all sectors 
surveyed. Notably, the sector excels in AI adoption, with 34 percent 
of organizations achieving a return on investment (ROI) from multiple 
AI use cases. However, the report also identifies significant maturity 
gaps in areas such as supply chain, procurement, and finance 
functions, which hinder the full realization of digital potential. 
To address these challenges and capitalize on the opportunities 
presented by digital transformation, several recommendations emerge 
from the report. First, organizations should focus on enhancing their 
data strategies to help ensure seamless integration and analysis 
across disparate systems. This is crucial for unlocking the full potential

Second, upskilling the workforce is essential to help bridge the skills 
gap exacerbated by the rise of AI. Training programs should target 
analytical decision-making and foster a data-centric culture, enabling 
employees to leverage real-time data effectively. Furthermore, 
organizations must prioritize the development of robust cybersecurity 
measures to protect internal data networks, especially as they begin 
to share data in real time with external partners.
Lastly, fostering a culture of innovation 
and agility will be vital for meeting 
evolving client expectations regarding 
lead times and customization. By 
investing in processes that elevate the 
voice of the customer, manufacturers 
can gain insights that drive new product 
lines and revenue streams.

Striving for digital maturity and a culture of 
innovation is a continual goal of and challenge 
for our industrial manufacturing clients. Today 
we’re helping them architect and implement 
strategies that embrace AI, machine learning 
and data transformation, but with a concurrent 
focus on how their human talent can thrive in 
such environments. Both elements are equally 
important to their long-term success.

According to Saurabh Bhatnagar, Partner, Industrial Automation, 
Intelligence and Digitalization, KPMG in India, meeting client 
expectations around lead times and customization is a prime area for 
the sector to generate value from technologies.
“Clients’ lead-time expectations are becoming shorter by the 
day,” says Bhatnagar. “The market requires more agile, responsive 
production capabilities — from the sourcing of raw materials to the 
downstream supply of goods.” 
As production specifications become more complex and bespoke, 
many organizations are turning to digital interventions, systems, 
processes and controls to bring customization, reliability and speed 
into production cycles. These upgrades should also extend to 
operational workflows in supply chain, procurement, sales, and 
finance functions, among other areas.
“The value chain of industrial manufacturing is being connected and 
enhanced by digital features,” says Bhatnagar. “This hybrid model is 
making the entire value chain faster, informed, more disciplined and 
agile in responding to market needs.” 
These efficiency gains are also helping to improve the energy 
efficiency of production processes, according to Bhatnagar, for 
instance in reducing the idle time of machines or reducing batch 
cycle times of certain other processes. Here, AI and machine learning 
(ML) are playing crucial roles in finding more sustainable and green 
operational strategies for manufacturers to deploy. 
This maturity is underpinned by a culture of tech enthusiasm: 
76 percent of industrial manufacturing firms say their workforce 
has an appetite to embrace cutting-edge technology — the highest 
proportion of all sectors surveyed. 
The manufacturing sector appears to be taking a more comprehensive 
approach to its technology evaluation. This year, executives are drawing 
on a wider range of sources to inform their investment decisions. 
That said, the drivers have shifted in terms of which has the strongest 
influence on tech choices. While “following competitors” is still a top 
decision driver (85 percent) in 2024, it has fallen to second, behind 
“looking to third-party guidance” (89 percent). 
These tactics, paired with the sector’s proactive and progressive 
spirit, appear to be paying off.

Industrial manufacturing is the leading sector in AI adoption. It  is one of the three sectors most likely to be at the 
most mature phase of AI adoption, with 34 percent securing ROI on several of their AI use cases. But, while there 
are pockets of success, the sector needs to address critical gaps that prevent it from accessing the full potential 
of AI, including but not limited to improving data-based predictions, optimizing products, augmenting innovation, 
enhancing productivity and efficiency, and lowering costs.

One of the prominent AI use cases in the sector is using predictive 
maintenance to enhance equipment reliability. Performance 
diagnostics AI, alongside strategic data generation and storage, allows 
workers to analyze real-time data from various machine components. 
This helps them to make informed decisions about equipment 
functionality, performance and reliability. Also, organizations are 
applying AI and ML image recognition technologies to evaluate 
the quality of a finished product to inform interventions that will 
improve later batches. Firms are also using AI and ML to upgrade the 
environmental efficiencies of their equipment as ESG targets become 
more important across the sector.
Another productive use case is how the sector is using AI to address 
talent shortages. Four in five manufacturing executives say that 
AI is filling skills gaps among knowledge workers — gaps that had 
previously presented a major challenge. 
Bhatnagar advises that, as industrial manufacturers incorporate AI 
and ML into their business models, upskilling programs should target 
analytical decision-making and science technology skills, as well as 
creating a data-centric culture.

“So, factory workers can make better real-time decisions on the 
ground based on data that’s being thrown at them,” says Bhatnagar. 
“[Factory] floor workers should take the lead on the decisions that AI 
and ML are not reliable enough to make right now. Before AI, floor 
workers made 30 to 40 decisions a day. Now, they just need to focus 
on, say, 10 extremely critical, high-value decisions.” 
In terms of other AI use cases at play in the sector, the rapid 
development of industrial and process control applications 
underpinned by AI packages, low-cost computer hardware and 
graphical-user-interface technology has led to the emergence 
of virtual instrumentation. Also known as ‘soft sensors,’ virtual 
instrumentation acts as a substitute for physical sensors and 
combines real-time data, digital tech and AI-backed mathematical 
models to estimate product quality. 
These soft sensors provide measurements at points in production lines 
where it is impossible to install a physical sensor due to prohibitive 
costs or harsh operational conditions. They combine multiple real-
time data sources of process variables — such as water flow rates, 
temperatures, pressure and speed of travel on a conveyor — and 
convert them into a number to forecast the quality of a product. 
In the realm of industrial manufacturing, the integration of advanced engineering systems and design 
methodologies is paramount for fostering innovation and enhancing operational efficiency. While the 
sector has been meticulously working to adopt the latest technologies, including artificial intelligence 
(AI) and extensive machine learning capabilities, these are often siloed within individual systems such 
as customer relationship management and procurement platforms. 
 
Martin Kaestner 
Technology Leader, Industrial Manufacturing 
KPMG in the US
For instance, rather than waiting to evaluate batch quality at the end 
of the production process, one large integrated steel manufacturing 
plant is deploying soft sensors at all stages of its manufacturing 
cycle. This end-to-end monitoring provides opportunities for 
proactive interventions that can preserve the stability of production 
and minimize the presence of contaminants that could cause 
batches to be rejected. “This saves the plant from wasting 
production capacity and energy on producing off-spec materials,” 
says Bhatnagar.  
While these advanced engineering systems and design 
methodologies are crucial to innovation, the influence of these AI 
use cases is often restricted by connectivity gaps between systems 
and data sets, says Martin Kaestner, Technology Leader, Industrial 
Manufacturing, KPMG in the US.
“The true potential of AI is realized when data from disparate 
systems, such as customer relationship management and 
procurement platforms, is aggregated and analyzed holistically,” 
says Kaestner. “This is particularly critical in sectors such as 
aerospace and defense, where organizations often possess some 
of the best-engineered products, yet they struggle to identify critical 
gaps in their operational frameworks because of silos.” 
“The inability to synthesize data across various platforms in modern 
manufacturing environments will skew the visibility AI models have of 
critical areas such as global supply chain dynamics,” Kaestner adds.
Without a cohesive strategy to fully integrate and analyze data from 
multiple sources, companies risk missing out on valuable AI-powered 
insights that could drive efficiency, reduce costs, and accelerate time 
to market.

How effective are your data and analytics activities in the following areas? (Influential/embedded)
But rather than become complacent, the sector continues to hold 
itself to high standards and maintains ambitious data goals. Although 
its access to data is high, industrial manufacturing is also the sector 
whose organizations are most likely to be alert to the fact that 
further improvements to the data strategy would accelerate the 
pace of digital transformation. For instance, to take full advantage 
of generative AI, industrial manufacturers will need to construct a 
reliable, trustworthy data infrastructure that is customized to their 
business needs. 
So, how can the sector’s organizations make sure that their data 
strategies are enablers of progress, rather than blockers? “To make 
their businesses more profitable and customer centric, manufacturers 
need to keep increasing their visualization capabilities and workflows 
to facilitate data-led decision-making and ensure these insights reach 
the right employees at the right time,” says Bhatnagar. “There is still 
work to be done here, but they are on the verge of getting this right.” 
A crucial step will be to provide dashboard interfaces that present 
data insights in a clear and intuitive format, so that workers can 
make decisions quickly. The success of these platforms will depend 
heavily on data governance and interoperability capabilities, which, 
in comparison with other sectors, are both key skills for industrial 
manufacturing. On both counts, industrial manufacturing performed 
7 percentage points higher than the cross-sector average of 
51 percent. 
Interoperability will be an especially important requirement for 
trustworthy digital innovation, and particularly when it comes to AI. 
To sustain their momentum and move data at high speeds and even 
in real time, manufacturers must focus parts of their cyber security 
strategies on protecting internal data transfer. “One of the biggest 
things manufacturers have to address is building enough security 
protection around their internal networks to engineering design 
systems,” says Bhatnagar. “Especially for when they begin to share 
data in real time with the outside world.”

As the manufacturing sector responds strategically to shifting supply chain dynamics and growing environmental demands, its organizations should:  
Nurture the proactive and progressive spirit that is powering their digital transformation efforts. The ongoing evolution of cyber security 
strategies should feature initiatives that enhance the security protection of internal data networks plugging into engineering design systems, 
especially for real-time data sharing.
Improve visualization capabilities and workflows to help workers make better decisions based on data insights. And make sure that these 
insights reach the right employees at the right times. 
In parallel with the rise of AI in the workplace, prepare the workforce by upskilling factory workers with learning programs that target 
analytical decision-making and science technology skills. IM executives are more inclined than most to believe that Gen AI will boost 
productivity and enhance collaboration with a positive impact in IT and creative jobs.1
Explore new ways to innovate to meet clients’ expectations of speed and customization, and make operations more energy efficient. By 
capturing and centralizing the ad hoc data provided by consumers when they share their preferences and feedback on certain product features, 
manufacturers could find insights that lead to new product lines or revenue streams. Invest in processes and systems that elevate the voice of 
the customer so that the organization can give its target audience what it wants.
Manufacturing might be ahead of other sectors in digital transformation, but the need to innovate does not stop here. “We will continue to see a constant 
push for innovation,” says KPMG in India’s Saurabh Bhatnagar. “More technology, more agility, more tailoring to suit the customer, and faster speed to 
delivery. To meet these needs, the industrial manufacturing sector will need to rely on digital interventions even more in future.”

To really optimize the use of AI and new 
technology, industrial manufacturers 
need to combine what they do best 
(manufacture physical products) with 
what digital does best (collect real-time 
data and embed AI) to differentiate their 
products and gain a new competitive 
advantage. It will not be enough to add 
digital functionality to analog machines — 
a complete re-imagination is needed.
