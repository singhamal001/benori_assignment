Drive the next wave of digital transformation with 
data and decisiveness 
KPMG global 
tech report: 
Energy insights
Executive summary
The energy sector is at a pivotal crossroads, facing unprecedented 
challenges and opportunities. Addressing the challenges and seizing 
the energy transition opportunities will require a unified approach 
that integrates technology, data and strategy across the entire 
business. This dual challenge demands innovative solutions and 
strategic foresight, making it imperative for energy leaders to leverage 
advanced technologies and data-driven insights to drive the next 
wave of digital transformation.
Our research finds that the energy sector is more resilient and 
willing to take risks than other sectors, but it needs to increase 
investments in data capabilities and artificial intelligence (AI) 
to unlock its next wave of digital transformation. Based on a 
comprehensive survey of 2,450 global technology leaders, this 
report examines the experiences of 122 energy technology 
leaders from 19 countries and provides valuable insights into digital 
transformation in the energy industry.
Energy is more resilient and willing to take risks than other sectors, but it needs to increase investments in 
data capabilities and AI to unlock its next wave of digital transformation. 
This report advocates that energy leaders must leverage data and 
decisiveness to drive the next wave of digital transformation within 
their organizations. By methodically experimenting with AI use cases 
and leveraging cyber security frameworks, energy companies can 
protect against threats that could hinder digital innovation. While 
the energy sector matches or surpasses other industries in many IT 
disciplines, achievements are often confined to isolated functional 
areas rather than spanning entire organizations or ecosystems.
As technological innovation opens new potential in the energy 
sector, a balance needs to be struck between rapid adoption and 
a strategic approach to extracting genuine value from technology. 
Evidence-based decisions should be made to navigate through the 
hype and find resilient solutions, scaling new tools such as AI safely 
and responsibly.
Energy CEOs view Gen AI as both 
a risk and an opportunity. But the 
risks — of falling behind and/or 
making a fatal error in terms of 
privacy, ethics or integrity — 
can be managed, while there is 
hardly an area of business where 
AI can’t bring value. Integrating 
AI really comes down to change 
management, and that’s something 
CEOs should feel confident about as 
long as they have the fundamental 
guardrails in place.

Key 
findings
The energy sector is bolder than 
others on technology
Energy is not letting influences such as economic 
uncertainty, complex regulatory developments 
and market competitiveness crush its confidence 
about exploring new technologies. For instance, 
growing market competitiveness has dented 
the investment confidence of other sectors to a 
larger extent than the energy industry. Energy 
has a more resilient mindset than the cross-sector 
average across all influences measured.
“The energy sector is resilient by nature because companies cannot 
survive without planning for the long haul,” says Sushant Rabra, 
Partner at KPMG in India. This pragmatic thinking is reflected in how 
energy companies make investment decisions around technology. 
Executives in the sector are committed and have a clear view of what 
they want to achieve, which empowers them to end projects that are 
not performing as hoped. Energy is the sector that is most likely to say 
it can stop a digital transformation project when it becomes clear that it 
is not bringing the anticipated value.
“Energy companies must prioritize strategic direction over specific 
technologies or platforms,” says Rabra. This requires companies to 
constantly re-evaluate performance, take stock of competition and  
stay on top of emerging technologies. It also helps reduce the risk  
of complacency. 
According to Rabra, “Energy companies are surrounded by 
opportunities because they are at the forefront of enabling multiple 
transitions, including AI and sustainability.” The survey suggests that 
this translates into an appetite for innovation and risk-taking, with 
25 percent of the energy organizations saying that risk aversion 
either never or hardly ever makes senior leadership in their 
organizations move more slowly than the competition in embracing 
tech; the cross-sector average is 17 percent.
Like last year, the sector has a strong belief in 22the potential of 
modern delivery systems: 70 percent of energy organizations are 
planning to invest in low-code/no-code platforms in the next year — 
7 percentage points more than the cross-sector average. And similar 
to the cross-sector average, the most immediate investments are 
likely to go to XaaS systems: 80 percent plan to invest in them in the 
next 6 months.
“The evolving nature of XaaS provides energy companies with 
opportunities to experiment in a low-cost way,” says Rabra. “But 
they must think about the architectural integrity of their entire 
tech stacks when they deploy it. However mature the individual 
components of XaaS are, merging them can be risky. To combat 
this, companies should be intentional about the technology they use 
and avoid moving too quickly between solutions.” 
25% 
of energy businesses have no 
trouble managing costs and 
keeping within their budget — 
the highest of all sectors.

Article 1
The energy sector is bolder 
than others on technology
67% 
of energy businesses have 
already seen business value 
from AI.
Fortunately, the energy sector’s bold outlook is 
not tipping over into recklessness. For instance, 
energy firms appear to be taking a slightly more 
gradual, methodical approach to AI adoption 
than other sectors. The majority of energy firms 
are in the top two maturity stages of AI adoption 
and are achieving business value from their 
active AI use cases.
Energy companies are methodically 
experimenting with AI use cases
But a sizable proportion of the sector (33 percent) is taking a 
cautious approach and is still within the proof-of-concept stage for 
AI experimentation. Energy sector executives are 8 percentage 
points more likely than the cross-sector average to be in the two 
earlier stages of AI implementation. 
While the majority of energy firms are in the top two maturity 
stages of AI use case adoption, a sizable proportion of the sector is 
still within the proof-of-concept stage.
“Energy executives are showing an increased interest in AI,” says 
Dan Fisher, Principal, Advisory, Digital Lighthouse, KPMG in the US. 
“But while they’re eager to explore AI’s potential, there are three 
main factors tempering the pace of their adoption.”
First, the sector must be methodical about maximizing the value 
of its investment lifecycles. Unlike other industries, the energy 
sector was a fast mover in making significant investments in earlier 
generations of enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems. “So now 
it faces a larger task in modernizing this entrenched infrastructure 
to access the cloud capabilities required for additional AI initiatives,” 
says Fisher.  
Second, many of the energy companies that have already started 
to implement AI are struggling to scale it across the board because 
they did not sufficiently redesign the roles and processes involved. 
Fisher adds “And finally, many energy firms lack robust, unified  
data foundations, which hinders their ability to benefit fully from 
AI’s capabilities.”
Nevertheless, the industry clearly recognizes AI’s potential:  
67 percent of energy executives say they have already seen business 
value from it. One prominent way in which the sector uses AI is 
predictive maintenance, where performance of the electrical grid is 
continuously monitored to identify potential failures before they happen. 
This should benefit both energy organizations and their customers 
because it significantly improves resource reliability.

has accelerated its adoption of advanced 
technology, including AI. 
Building solid data foundations and

Working with data requires a fundamentally different approach than 
traditional technology systems. Businesses should adopt measures that help 
ensure greater accountability and transparency throughout the entire data 
lifecycle — from collection to storage and analysis. Establishing guiding 
principles rooted in fairness, explicability and purpose is essential to fostering 
the ethical use of enterprise AI assets. Effective monitoring systems are also 
critical, providing regular assessments to ensure compliance and maintain 
necessary checks and balances. Additionally, investing in initiatives that 
cultivate an AI-enabled workforce will embed a culture of ethical AI in the 
workplace. For energy companies, which naturally possess a higher degree of 
self-awareness, implementing these measures should come more seamlessly.

Data maturity gaps make it harder for the 
sector to prove the value of its technology
The majority of energy executives in the survey say that their 
organization is satisfied with the value it gets from technology 
investments, but they do lag behind other industries.
Visibility limitations are likely to be a contributing factor for the energy industry. In the nine 
areas measured in the survey, energy executives are on average 11 percentage points less 
likely than the cross-sector average to say they are confident in their organization’s ability to 
quantitatively measure the value being generated by its technologies. Customer, employee 
and environmental metrics are the areas where confidence is lowest. 
“This lack of visibility presents challenges when it comes to decision-making and capital 
allocation,” says Rabra.  
A likely contributing factor here will be that the sector is lagging on data maturity in all 
categories measured. Just 36 percent of executives describe their organization’s ability to 
extract meaningful insights as either influential or embedded — our top two levels of data 
maturity — compared with 52 percent across all sectors. And just 35 percent of energy 
executives say their data science capabilities are in the top two levels of data maturity, 
compared with 50 percent across all sectors.

The energy sector is going to have to invest in the quality, visibility, 
transparency and integration of its data across the value chain.3 
It needs to unite the many data pools it has access to — from 
operational data to financial data. “This will allow companies to get 
a much better sense of where impact is being made and where 
corrections are needed,” says Rabra. “Not having this visibility can 
lead to suboptimal performance, for instance with grid maintenance 
and investment allocation.” 
Fortunately, these investments are already under way. Compared with 
2023, energy businesses are now more likely to say both their data 
investments and data governance are influential or embedded. 
“Many clients are building data expertise through internal quality 
assessments,” says Rabra. “We’re also seeing many organizations 
unbundling their tech, digital and data teams and appointing separate 
leaders for each. Making one person solely accountable for the 
quality of data can significantly boost consistency and efficiency.” 
KPMG’s value realization framework is an effective way to do this.

Case study
It helps organizations map their technology investments against 
business goals by using balanced scorecards and KPIs aligned with 
strategic objectives. This high-level insight is crucial to avoiding a 
‘tech for tech’s sake’ mindset, where tech is implemented without 
having real business value.
XaaS is also playing a crucial role in creating business value. It is 
having more impact on the data maturity of energy than any other 
sector: 43 percent of energy executives say their organization has 
improved data management and integration because of its XaaS 
usage in the past 12 months — 6 percentage points higher than the 
overall average.
Generative AI will also be a game changer for data-led decision-
making and capital allocation via predictive analytics. While the 
predictive maintenance of assets is not a new practice, the 
sophistication of today’s models makes it possible to integrate 
predictive insights into broader digital production processes. This 
allows organizations to optimize cash flow and predict margins more 
effectively, ultimately improving decision-making about investments.
 
When oil and gas producer Encino Energy 
acquired 900 wells from Chesapeake Energy, it 
quickly became clear that its operational needs 
exceeded the capabilities of its usual ways of 
working. These working practices depended on 
a small set of applications, spreadsheets, email 
and offline communications. 
As Chesapeake’s data poured in, Encino’s 
employees spent hours compiling reports from 
disconnected sources, fixing conflicting data 
formats and disputing data integrity. Encino 
lacked visibility into real-time well economics, 
struggled to optimize field operations and 
burned through cycles manually comparing 
production output to forecasts. 
To swiftly modernize its data and analytics 
functions, Encino asked KPMG in the US 
to create a scalable data foundation. As a 
result, Encino now has a scalable cloud-based 
architecture, fitted with master datasets that 
surface insights across disparate systems. 
This data infrastructure is improving Encino’s

Energy executives maintain that using cyber 
security and privacy considerations 5 to guide 
technology implementation is essential for 
organizations to thrive in a digital economy. This 
explains why energy companies are increasingly 
making sure that their digital solutions are secure 
by design. 
5 KPMG International, ‘Cybersecurity considerations 2024: Energy and natural resources sector,’ 2024  
6 KPMG International, ‘Investing in cybersecurity to safeguard innovation,’ 2024
“Digital solutions are designed to create value, but once this is 
generated it must be preserved,” explains Rabra. “This is especially 
true in the energy sector, where the huge scale of operations and 
direct impact on the economy creates many risks of data exposure.” 
This might explain why energy companies are 9 percentage points 
less likely than the cross-sector average to say that cyber security is 
frequently treated as a tick-boxing exercise in staff training and is not 
embedded as extensively as it could be. 
“Energy companies understand that cyber security is not just 
a shield but a catalyst for value creation,” says Ronald Heil, 
Global Cyber Lead for Energy and Natural Resources at KPMG 
International. “Treating cyber security as a driver of value, 
operational integrity and profitability helps organizations to build 
resilience and maximize digital ROI.”
This organizational mindset goes beyond reducing incidents; 
it helps transforms security into a critical enabler for growth and 
agility.6 A collaborative approach, within and across sectors, ensures 
that companies can collectively defend against emerging threats, 
strengthening resilience across industries rather than leaving 
individual organizations vulnerable to cyber-attacks. “While larger 
firms also strive to maintain a balance with the principle that cyber 
security should not be a competitive advantage, sharing intelligence is 
essential to helping secure the entire supply chain and ecosystem as 
a whole,” says Heil.

for AI adoption.
Empower your teams by 
building AI literacy and 
fostering cross-functional 
collaboration. Continuous 
knowledge-sharing 
initiatives can close 
skills gaps and promote 
confidence in deploying 
AI for operational 
improvements and clean 
energy initiatives.
06.
Scale pilots 
responsibly. 
Pilot emerging 
technologies on a 
small scale to validate 
their effectiveness 
before broader 
implementation. For 
instance, test AI models 
for renewable energy 
forecasting or grid 
optimization in select 
regions, scaling based 
on proven outcomes.
07.
Build a strong  
data backbone.
As the industry evolves, 
robust data infrastructure 
is expected to be essential 
for evaluating the impact of 
new technologies. Investing 
in data systems not only 
increases confidence in 
performance metrics but 
also unlocks synergies 
across departments by 
integrating data pools. 
Establishing a centralized 
data leadership team 
can further enhance data 
quality and accountability, 
empowering executives 
with precise insights to 
inform strategic decisions.
02.
Leverage AI’s 
transformative 
capabilities across 
operations and  
climate initiatives. 
The potential of AI in the 
energy sector is vast, from 
enabling predictive analysis to 
enhancing climate action efforts. 
According to KPMG India’s 
ACED (accelerating clean energy 
delivery) through AI report,7 
AI can dramatically improve 
efficiency within energy systems 
and drive the rapid scaling of 
renewables. Embracing AI 
fully, with a strategic focus 
on sustainability, can position 
companies at the forefront of the 
clean energy transition.
