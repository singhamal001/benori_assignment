https://kpmg.com/in/en/insights/2025/02/aau-accounting-and-auditing-update-february-2025.html,Issue no. 103 | February 2025,This edition of AAU covers relevant financial and reporting updates,2025-02-28 00:00:00,"Ind AS 103, Business Combination provides guidance on accounting for business combinations under the acquisition method. Business combinations are transactions or events in which a reporting entity (acquirer) obtains control of one or more businesses (the acquiree). The date of acquisition is the date on which acquirer obtains control of the acquiree. Ind AS 103 provides an acquirer a time frame, referred to as the ‘measurement period’, after the acquisition date to finalise its initial accounting of the business combination. An acquirer in a business combination is required to report provisional amounts when the measurements are incomplete at the end of the reporting period covering the business combination. This edition of Accounting and Auditing Update (AAU) includes an article to discuss the key aspects of the measurement period in a business combination. It discusses the use of provisional amounts, the accounting implications of adjustments made within this period, and the required disclosures in such situations.
 
The IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards IFRS S1, General Requirements for Disclosure of Sustainability-related Financial Information and IFRS S2, Climate-related Disclosures issued by the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) form the global baseline for sustainability-related disclosures. The standards require companies to provide a complete and balanced explanation of sustainability-related risks and opportunities. Companies disclose material information about the sustainability-related risks and opportunities that could reasonably be expected to affect an entity’s cash flows, its access to finance or its cost of capital over the short, medium, or long term. To support the implementation of IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards, in November 2024, the ISSB issued an education material ‘Sustainability-related risks and opportunities and the disclosure of material information’. The educational material provides guidance to help identify and disclose material information about sustainability-related risks and opportunities that are likely to affect an entity’s prospects. The article on this topic summarises the education material and discusses guidance related to identification and disclosure of material information.   

As always, we have included a regular round-up of recent regulatory updates in India and internationally.   

We would be delighted to receive feedback and suggestions from you on the topics we should cover in forthcoming editions of AAU.

https://kpmg.com/in/en/insights/2025/02/food-and-nutritional-security-in-india.html,Food and Nutritional Security in India,"Solutions for achieving zero hunger and ensuring food and nutritional security, addressing gaps in access, distribution, and sustainability",2025-02-20 00:00:00,"Food security has been a critical aspect of India's public policy since Independence. While the country ranks among the top global food producers and exporters, millions still struggle with access to adequate and nutritious food. According to the 2024 Global Hunger Index (GHI), India ranks 105th out of 127 countries, highlighting the persistent challenges of hunger and malnutrition. Additionally, the UN’s State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World (SOFI) report states that over 19.46 crore people—approximately 13.4% of India’s population—are chronically undernourished.
Strengthening India’s public food distribution system (PDS)
One of the key strategies to achieve zero hunger is strengthening India’s public food distribution system (PDS). The Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS) under the National Food Security Act (NFSA) has been instrumental in providing subsidized food grains to millions. However, challenges such as inefficiencies in supply chain management, leakages, and exclusion errors must be addressed through digital reforms, Aadhaar-linked beneficiary tracking, and improved last-mile delivery mechanisms.
Sustainable Agriculture
Sustainable agriculture is another crucial pillar in ensuring long-term food security. Promoting climate-resilient farming practices, enhancing irrigation efficiency, and encouraging crop diversification can help improve productivity while preserving natural resources. Additionally, supporting smallholder farmers through direct income support, improved market linkages, and access to quality seeds and fertilizers will contribute to a more robust food supply system.
Balanced Nutrition
Another major aspect of food security is ensuring balanced nutrition, particularly for vulnerable groups such as children, pregnant women, and lactating mothers. Government programs like the Mid-Day Meal Scheme (MDMS) and the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) play a vital role in addressing malnutrition. Expanding these programs with fortified foods, nutrition education, and community participation can further enhance their impact.
Technology and Innovation
Technology and innovation can also drive improvements in food security. The use of artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, and remote sensing can help monitor food supply chains, reduce wastage, and optimize distribution. Digital platforms connecting farmers directly to consumers can eliminate middlemen, ensuring better prices for farmers and lower costs for consumers.
Additionally, achieving food security and zero hunger requires collaboration across various stakeholders, including government bodies, private sector players, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and international agencies. Public-private partnerships (PPPs) can help scale up successful models of food production, distribution, and nutritional interventions. Global best practices, such as Brazil’s Zero Hunger Program, can offer valuable insights for policy refinement in India.
Lastly, raising awareness about sustainable consumption and reducing food waste are essential. Strengthening food banks, promoting community kitchens, and encouraging responsible consumer behavior can significantly impact food security at the grassroots level.
India has made progress in improving food availability, but significant challenges remain in accessibility and affordability. A multi-pronged approach integrating efficient distribution, sustainable agriculture, nutritional programs, technology-driven solutions, and strong policy frameworks is essential to achieve zero hunger and food security for all. With concerted efforts, India can move closer to eradicating hunger and malnutrition, ensuring a healthier and more prosperous future for its citizens.
The report outlines solutions for achieving zero hunger and ensuring food and nutritional security through a multi-stakeholder approach, addressing gaps in access, distribution, and agricultural sustainability

https://kpmg.com/in/en/insights/2025/02/financial-crime-bulletin.html,Financial Crime Bulletin,Dive deep into the financial crime avenues and stay up-to-date with Indian and global regulatory initiatives,2025-02-10 00:00:00,"Financial crimes have become an ever-evolving problem. Methods of perpetrating such crimes are going beyond traditional avenues and increasing in sophistication and technological integration, posing new challenges for financial institutions (FIs). Around USD3.1 trillion in illicit funds and USD485.6 billion in fraud scams and bank fraud schemes is estimated to have happened in 2023 alone with technology playing a major role in helping such crimes. 
In 2024, we saw some major regulatory initiatives/enactments with the U.S.A. enacting the Corporate Transparency Act (CTA), while the European Union introduced the AML Package, including the establishment of the Anti-Money Laundering Authority (AMLA), a new 6th Anti-Money Laundering Directive, and updated Transfer of Funds Regulations (TFRs) for crypto asset transfers. The U.K. has rolled out the Economic Crime Plan 2 (ECP2) and the G7 countries are working on AI regulations to combat financial crimes more effectively.
Corporate Transparency Act (CTA)2

Effective 1 January 2024, The U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) has started accepting beneficial ownership information reports under the Corporate Transparency Act (CTA). Existing companies must file by 1 January 2025, while new companies have 90 days from creation or registration to file beneficial ownership information such as name, date of birth, address, and identification number.
DOJ AML Policy Initiatives3

On 15 April 2024, the Department of Justice has introduced a pilot programme offering non-prosecution agreements (NPAs) to individuals who voluntarily disclose original information about corporate and white-collar crimes. The programme incentivises reporting by providing immunity in exchange for cooperation, including full disclosure, assistance in investigations, and restitution for disclosures made on or after 15 April 2024.











AML (Anti Money Laundering) Compliance for Securities Market15


On 6 June 2024, SEBI updated AML compliance requirements for securities market intermediaries, including enhanced due diligence and transaction monitoring. This aims to strengthen the integrity of the securities market and prevent financial crimes.
Internal Risk Assessment guidance for money laundering/terrorist financing risks16

The Reserve Bank of India issued comprehensive guidelines on 10 October 2024, for internal risk assessments by banks, NBFCs, and regulated entities to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and proliferation financing. These guidelines aim to streamline the AML/TF risk assessment process, enhance operational efficiency, and align with global standards. They address sector-specific risks and provide a detailed methodology for risk identification. This move equips financial institutions to manage current and future financial crime challenges effectively.
Fraud Risk Management in Commercial Banks (including Regional Rural Banks) and All India Financial Institutions17

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) issued the Master Directions on Fraud Risk Management in Commercial Banks (including Regional Rural Banks) and All India Financial Institutions (AIFIs) on 15 July 2024. These directions aim to provide a robust framework for the prevention, early detection, and timely reporting of frauds

Brokers' institutional mechanism for prevention and detection of fraud or market abuse18

On 4 July 2024, SEBI introduced measures focusing on brokers' institutional mechanisms for the prevention and detection of fraud or market abuse like surveillance systems, employee obligations, escalation and reporting mechanisms, whistleblower policy, implementation standards, and compliance timeline as these provisions will be phased on broker size, with effective dates ranging from 1 January 2025, to 1 April 2026.
We are already witnessing changes in the Financial Services landscape as result of Web 3.0 and digital payment advancements streamlining transactions. Such changes also provide fraudsters / criminals with advanced tools for more effective scams. Such evolutions in technology offers new avenues for deceptive tactics, from phishing scams utilising artificial intelligence to complex hacking methods that exploit blockchain vulnerabilities. 




The financial crime landscape will continue to evolve, and staying ahead requires a proactive approach, leveraging the latest technologies and consistently updating strategies. It’s an arms race, but with the right tool and knowledge, FIs can effectively combat these emerging threats. In times to come, it is expected that regulatory changes will continue encompass and embrace the challenges posed by such emerging technologies.
