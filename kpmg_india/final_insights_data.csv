Editorial
Ind AS 103, Business Combination provides 
guidance on accounting for business combinations 
under the acquisition method. Business 
combinations are transactions or events in which a 
reporting entity (acquirer) obtains control of one or 
more businesses (the acquiree). The date of 
acquisition is the date on which acquirer obtains 
control of the acquiree. Ind AS 103 provides the 
acquirer a time frame, referred to as the 
‘measurement period’, after the acquisition date to 
finalise its initial accounting of the business 
combination. An acquirer in a business 
combination is required to report provisional 
amounts when the measurements are incomplete 
at the end of the reporting period covering the 
business combination. This edition of Accounting 
and Auditing Update (AAU) includes an article to 
discuss the key aspects of the measurement 
period in a business combination. It discusses the 
use of provisional amounts, the accounting 
implications of adjustments made within this 
period, and the required disclosures in such 
situations.
The IFRS Sustainability Disclosure 
Standards IFRS S1, General Requirements for 
Disclosure of Sustainability-related Financial 
Information and IFRS S2, Climate-related 
Disclosures issued by the International 
Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) form the 
global baseline for sustainability-related 
disclosures. The standards require companies to 
provide a complete and balanced explanation of 
sustainability-related risks and opportunities. 
Companies disclose material information about the 
sustainability-related risks and opportunities that 
could reasonably be expected to affect an entity’s 
cash flows, its access to finance or its cost of 
capital over the short, medium, or long term. 
To support the implementation of IFRS 
Sustainability Disclosure Standards, in November 
2024, the ISSB issued an education material 
‘Sustainability-related risks and opportunities and 
the disclosure of material information’. The 
educational material provides guidance to help 
identify and disclose material information about 
sustainability-related risks and opportunities that 
are likely to affect an entity’s prospects. The article 
on this topic summarises the education material 
and discusses guidance related to identification 
and disclosure of material information.
There have been various regulatory developments 
in India and internationally during the month. 
Recently, the Securities and Exchange Board of 
India (SEBI) various notifications such as a 
consultation paper to review aspects relating to 
secretarial compliance report, appointment of 
auditors and Related Party Transactions (RPT). 
Additionally, SEBI issued a circular to provide 
Industry Standards Forum (ISF) to introduce 
standards for minimum information to be provided 
by listed entities for review by audit committee and 
shareholders for approval of RPTs. Subsequently, 
ISF introduced ‘Industry Standards on minimum 
information to be provided for review of the audit 
committee and shareholders for approval of RPT’. 
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) issued revised 
guidelines for Asset Reconstruction Companies 
(ARCs) to provide a structured and detailed 
framework for the settlement of dues by ARCs. 
Recently, the Institute of Chartered Accountants of 
India (ICAI) released its publication ‘Guidance on 
Non-Compliances Observed by Quality Review 
Board (QRB)’ to highlight common non-
compliances identified by the QRB and provides 
essential guidance to address these issues 
effectively. Our regulatory updates section covers 
these and other important regulatory 
developments.
We would be delighted to receive 
feedback/suggestions from you on the topics we 
should cover in the forthcoming editions of AAU.

CHAPTER 1
The measurement 
period in business 
combination
This article aims to:
• Discuss the key aspects around measurement period in a 
business combination.
Accounting and Auditing Update – February 2025
Ind AS 103, Business Combination provides 
guidance on accounting for business combinations 
under the acquisition method. Business 
combinations are transactions or events in which a 
reporting entity (acquirer) obtains control of one or 
more businesses (the acquiree). 
Business combinations are generally complex 
transactions and amongst the many challenges in 
accounting of these transactions, determining the 
fair values of acquiree’s assets liabilities and non-
controlling interest are particularly challenging 
when the business combination occurs shortly 
before the reporting period end or in situations 
where terms of business combination agreement 
are complex. Ind AS 103 provides an acquirer a 
time frame, referred to as the ‘measurement 
period’, to finalise its initial accounting of the 
business combination. In such situations, the 
acquirer is required to report provisional amounts 
for the items for which the accounting is 
incomplete, in its financial statements prepared 
during the measurement period. 
This article discusses the key aspects of 
measurement period, use of provisional amounts, 
accounting implications of adjustments made 
within the measurement period and the 
disclosures required.

Accounting and Auditing Update – February 2025
What is measurement period?
Measurement period is the period after the 
acquisition date during which the acquirer may 
adjust the provisional amounts recognised for the 
business combination. Measurement period 
provides entities with a reasonable period of time 
to obtain the information necessary to identify and  
measure the following as of the acquisition date in 
accordance with the requirements of Ind AS 103:
The identifiable assets acquired, liabilities 
assumed and any non-controlling interest in the 
acquiree.
The consideration transferred for the acquiree 
(or other amount used in measuring goodwill)
The equity interest in the acquiree previously 
held by the acquirer if the business 
combination is achieved in stages
The resulting goodwill or gain on a 
bargain purchase

Ind AS 103 states that the measurement period ends as 
soon as the acquirer receives the information that it 
needs or learns that more information is not obtainable 
and such period cannot exceed one year from the 
acquisition date.
Is measurement period an open period?
06
Ind AS 103 does not provide specific guidance on determining 
provisional amounts. These amounts are determined based on the 
available information at the date of acquisition, consistent with the 
recognition and measurement requirements of the standard. Entities 
would be expected to make a reasonable effort to determine 
provisional amounts, and it would not be appropriate to assign only 
nominal amounts, or no amounts, solely because the acquirer 
anticipates it is likely to receive additional information about facts and 
circumstances that existed at the date of acquisition.
Ind AS 103 requires the acquirer to consider all pertinent factors in 
determining whether information obtained after the acquisition date 
would result in an adjustment to the provisional amounts recognised or 
whether that information results from events that occurred after the 
acquisition date. Some of the pertinent factors are: 
•
Date when additional information is obtained 
•
Whether the acquirer can identify a reason for a change to 
provisional amounts. 
Information obtained shortly after the acquisition date is more likely to 
reflect circumstances that existed at the acquisition date than the 
information obtained several months later. For example, unless an 
intervening event that changed its fair value can be identified, the sale 
of an asset to a third party shortly after the acquisition date for an 
amount that differs significantly from its provisional fair value measured 
at that date is likely to indicate an error in the provisional amount.
Thus, whether an event should be recognised as an adjustment to a 
provisional amount or as a post-combination event may involve 
significant judgement.
An example where an entity may report in its financial statements using 
provisional amounts during the measurement period would be when an 
entity has not obtained the final valuation report required to account for 
the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in an acquisition by the 
time it issues its financial statements for the first reporting period 
following the business combination. 
Measurement period adjustments may affect not only the measurement 
of assets and liabilities but also their recognition. There could also be 
situations where new information is obtained about facts and 
circumstances that existed at the date of acquisition that may result in 
recognition of additional assets or liabilities that were not recognised at 
the acquisition date In other words, new information might be obtained 
about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date, but 
that were unknown at that date. This may indicate additional assets or 
liabilities (including those arising from contingencies) not recognised in 
the initial accounting for an acquisition should be recognised as part of 
the accounting for the business combination.
What are provisional amounts?

Until the accounting for a business combination is 
complete, the acquirer is required to disclose the 
following in its annual financial statements and in 
any interim financial statements:    
•
The reasons why the initial accounting for the 
business combination is incomplete
•
The assets, liabilities, equity interests or items 
of consideration for which the initial accounting 
is incomplete, and
•
The nature and amount of any measurement-
period adjustments recognised during the 
period.
Adjustment to provisional amounts 
Measurement-period adjustments are analogous 
to adjusting events after the reporting date under 
Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period i.e. 
events that occur after the reporting date but 
before the financial statements are authorised for 
issue and that provide evidence of a condition that 
existed at the reporting date .
Similarly, the effects of information that first 
becomes available during the measurement period 
and that provides evidence of conditions or 
circumstances that existed at the date of 
acquisition are reflected in the accounting at the 
date of acquisition – i.e. the adjustments are 
recognised retrospectively as if the accounting 
was completed at the date of acquisition. 
The acquirer revises its comparative information 
for prior periods presented in financial statements 
as needed, including making any change in 
depreciation, amortisation or other effects on 
comprehensive income that arise as a result of the 
adjustments.  
After the measurement period ends, the 
acquisition accounting is adjusted only to correct 
an error in accordance with Ind AS 8, Accounting 
Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and 
Errors. 
Disclosures required during the measurement period

These concepts are discussed by way of the following case studies:
Case Study 1
•
Company A acquires Company B on 28 February 2024. Company A seeks an independent valuation 
for an item of Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) acquired in the business combination.
•
The valuation for the said PPE was not complete by the time Company A issued its financial 
statements for the year ended 31 March 2024(*). 
•
In its financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2024, Company A recognised provisional fair 
value for such PPE, based upon information available, as INR30 crore. 
•
At the acquisition date, the said PPE had a remaining useful life of five years. 
•
Five months after the acquisition date, Company A received the independent valuation, which 
estimated the asset’s acquisition-date fair value as INR40 crore.
Evaluation of the measurement period adjustment in the financial statements for year ended 
31 March 2025:
In the year ended 31 March 2025, 
a) Company A would determine the measurement period adjustment of INR9.83 crore at the acquisition 
date as follows:
•
Fair value of INR40 crore less provisional value of INR30 crore i.e. INR10 crore less the additional 
depreciation that would have been recognised if the PPE was accounted at INR40 crore at the 
acquisition date (INR16.83 lakh for depreciation for a month).
b) Company A would retrospectively adjust the prior year information related to the acquisition of 
Company B as follows:
•
The carrying amount of PPE as at 31 March 2024 will increase by INR9.83 crore
•
The carrying amount of goodwill as at 31 March 2024 will decrease by INR10 crore
•
Depreciation expense for the year ended 31 March 2024 will increase by INR16.83 lakh.
c)
In accordance with paragraph B67(a) of Ind AS 103, Company A would disclose that the 
comparative information for the year ended 31 March 2024 is adjusted retrospectively to increase the 
fair value of the item of PPE at the acquisition date by INR9.83 crore, with a corresponding decrease 
in goodwill of INR10 crore and an increase in depreciation expense of INR16.83 lakh.
*It is pertinent to note that Company A in its financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2024 would disclose the reasons of why the initial accounting for PPE acquired in the business combination is incomplete.

Accounting and Auditing Update – February 2025
Distinguishing between new information about conditions that existed at the date of acquisition from 
Information that result from events that occur after the date of acquisition could have a significant impact 
on accounting of business combination. This assessment involves exercise of significant judgement. 
It is pertinent to note that measurement period does not provide an open one-year period following the 
acquisition date to complete the acquisition accounting. This is only to provide reasonable time to the 
acquirer to deal with accounting of complex business combination transaction and ends as soon as the 
acquirer receives the information it was seeking about facts and circumstances that existed as of the 
acquisition date or learns that more information is not available. In no circumstances should the 
measurement period exceed one year from the acquisition date.
As the standards do not provide elaborate guidance to determine provisional amounts, this requires 
companies to make reasonable efforts and significant judgement to determine these amounts 
appropriately based upon information available as at the acquisition date. Further, the entities should 
provide comprehensive disclosures about the items for which the business combination accounting has 
not been completed along with reasons and the nature and amount of any measurement-period 
adjustments recognised during the period.

Case Study 2
•
Company A acquires Company B on 28 February 2024
•
In its financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2024, Company A accounted for the assets 
acquired and liabilities assumed at provisional fair values
•
In April 2025, Company A obtained new information about facts and circumstances that existed as of 
the acquisition date that, if known, would have resulted in the recognition of an additional liability at 
that date.
Evaluation of the measurement period adjustment in the financial statements for year ended 
31 March 2025:
•
In this case, the measurement period ended on 28 February 2025 i.e. one year from the acquisition 
date
•
Management obtained the  new information about facts and circumstances that existed as at the 
acquisition date in April 2025 i.e. after the end of measurement period, and concluded that such 
adjustment is not resulting from an error in the business combination accounting
•
In this case, because the measurement period has ended and the adjustment resulting from the new 
information is not due to an error, Company A would not adjust the business combination accounting 
•
Instead, Company A would treat the new information as a subsequent event with respect to its 
financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2025. Accordingly, the financial statements for the 
year ended 31 March 2025 would reflect the effect of the adjustment resulting from the new 
information in financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2025 by recognising the additional 
liability through a charge to Statement of profit and loss.

Chapter 3
In continuation of our previous article in January 2025 edition, this article aims to discuss the guidance related to identification and disclosing of material information.
With an aim to support the implementation of first two IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards (the ISSB standards):
•
IFRS S1, General Requirements for Disclosure of Sustainability-related Financial Information (IFRS S1)
•
IFRS S2, Climate-related Disclosures (IFRS S2)
In November 2024, the ISSB issued an education material ‘Sustainability-related risks and opportunities and the disclosure of material information’. The standards require companies to disclose material 
information about the sustainability-related risks and opportunities that could reasonably be expected to affect entity’s prospects. The educational material explains the requirements related to identifying and 
disclosing material information about sustainability-related risks and opportunities that could reasonably be expected to affect an entity’s prospects. 
The educational material is structured into three sections:
•
Chapter 1: The definition of material information and its application in ISSB standards: Discusses the main components of the definition of ‘material information’ to enable an understanding of the use of 
this term and how to make materiality judgements in that context. 
•
Chapter 2: Sustainability-related risks and opportunities that could reasonably be expected to affect an entity’s prospects and its application in ISSB standards: Discusses what sustainability-related 
risks and opportunities are and how they could reasonably be expected to affect an entity’s prospects to enable an understanding of how this concept is used in ISSB standards. 
•
Chapter 3: Identifying and disclosing material information: Discusses the requirements associated with identifying and disclosing material information about sustainability-related risks and opportunities that 
could reasonably be expected to affect an entity’s prospects. 
In our previous edition of Accounting and Auditing Update January 2025, we have discussed the guidance related to identification of sustainability-related risks and opportunities. The subsequent section discusses 
guidance related to identification and disclosing of material information.

Chapter 3
The standard requires entities to provide material information about an entity’s sustainability-related risks and opportunities to help meet the information needs of primary users. The information is considered 
material when omitting, misstating or obscuring that information could reasonably be expected to influence primary users’ decisions. However, the distinct scope of the reported information including differences in 
relevant time horizons and the types of information required to meet the respective objectives of sustainability-related financial disclosures and the related financial statements requires that distinct materiality 
judgements should be used for those disclosures and for the related financial statements.
In relation to definition of ‘material information’, the education material provides following guidance relating to main components of the definition:
•
Information needs of primary users and the decisions they make based on general purpose financial reports: Materiality judgements involve considerations relating to both who the primary users are 
and what decisions they make based on general purpose financial reports. General purpose financial reports do not, and cannot, provide all the information that all primary users need. Therefore, an entity 
should meet the common information needs of primary users. Additionally, an entity assesses whether information is material based on whether that information could reasonably be expected to influence 
decisions of primary users. Although the entity itself makes this assessment, it is based on the perspective of primary users and their information needs. The materiality assessment requires an entity to consider 
the characteristics of primary users (such as, potential investors), while also considering the entity’s own circumstances (for example, the entity’s own industry). 
•
In the context of sustainability-related financial disclosures: Sustainability-related financial disclosures provide information about an entity’s sustainability related risks and opportunities that is useful to 
primary users of general-purpose financial reports in making decisions about providing resources to the entity. Although the definition of ‘material information’ in ISSB Standards is aligned with the definition of 
the same term in IFRS Accounting Standards, however, the information required to meet the objective of the respective general purpose financial reports is distinct. The materiality judgements an entity makes 
in preparing its sustainability-related financial disclosures will be distinct from those it makes in preparing its financial statements.
•
Meaning of ‘omitting, misstating or obscuring’ information: In assessing whether information is material, an entity considers the effect of omitting, misstating or obscuring that information on primary users’ 
decisions. An entity is required to identify its sustainability-related financial disclosures clearly and distinguish them from other information the entity provides. Therefore, an entity should ensure that 
sustainability-related financial disclosures are clearly identifiable and not obscured by additional information.

material information, November 2024)
Step 1: Identify information about sustainability-related risks and 
opportunities that has the potential to be material
Considering the requirements of ISSB standards, the education material states that as first step an entity 
should identify information about its sustainability-related risks and opportunities that primary users might 
need to understand to make decisions relating to providing resources to the entity. Once the entity has 
identified a sustainability-related risk or opportunity, an entity should apply the ISSB Standard 
requirements that specifically applies to identified sustainability-related risk or opportunity. Further, an 
entity should apply IFRS S2 in combination with IFRS S1, for example, if an entity identifies a climate-
related risk or opportunity then in determining the required level of disaggregation of climate-related 
information to provide, an entity should refer to the relevant requirements in IFRS S1.
The education material also highlights that the disclosure requirements in ISSB Standards specify items 
of information that an entity is required to provide if that information is material in the entity’s 
circumstances. The information to be provided should be useful to primary users in making decisions 
about providing resources to the entity. If an entity determines that information required by an ISSB 
Standard is not material, the entity need not disclose that information. In case, ISSB standard does not 
provide disclosure requirements relating to an entity’s identified sustainability-related risk or opportunity, 
in such scenarios IFRS S1 requires that an entity apply judgement to identify information that is:
• Relevant to primary users’ decision-making; and
• Faithfully represents the sustainability-related risk or opportunity. 
In applying such judgement, an entity needs to assess what information is useful to primary users. 
Further, to help an entity in assessing whether the information is relevant and faithfully represents the 
identified risk or opportunity, IFRS S1 specifies sources of guidance for the identification of relevant and 
hence, potentially material information.
The output of Step 1 is a set of potentially material information.

Step 2: Assess whether the potentially material information identified in 
Step 1 is material
The education material highlights that in Step 2, an entity assesses whether the potentially material 
information identified in Step 1 is, in fact, material. Considering that materiality judgements are specific to 
the entity, ISSB Standards do not specify any thresholds for material information or predetermine what 
information would be material in a particular situation.
When making materiality judgements, an entity considers whether the item of information could 
reasonably be expected to affect primary users’ assessment of the amount, timing and uncertainty of 
future net cash inflows to the entity and their assessment of stewardship of the entity’s economic 
resources sufficiently to influence their decisions. The education material highlights that following points 
should be considered when making materiality judgements:
•
Consideration of quantitative and qualitative factors: An entity should assess the materiality of 
information by considering both quantitative and qualitative factors, it would not be appropriate to rely 
on purely numerical guidelines or to apply a uniform quantitative threshold for all materiality 
judgements. Below are some of the considerations:
o Quantitative factors: An entity ordinarily assesses whether information is quantitatively material by 
considering the size of the effect of the sustainability-related risk or opportunity against other 
related measures. Examples of quantitative factors might include impact on cash flows, amount of 
resource consumption, return on investment or market share. A quantitative factor can be used to 
assess both the materiality of quantitative information, such as GHG emissions, and also 
qualitative information, such as qualitative information about an entity’s resilience to a specific 
sustainability-related risk.
o Qualitative factors: Qualitative factors, on other hand, are factors that an entity considers in making 
materiality judgements related to characteristic of the entity, such as its governance, and its 
interactions with its stakeholders, society, the economy and the natural environment throughout the 
entity’s value chain, that ultimately give rise to sustainability-related risks or opportunities. The 
ISSB standards highlights that existence of qualitative factor more likely to influence the decisions 
of primary users. Therefore, when making materiality judgements, an entity should consider both 
entity-specific and external qualitative factors. The table on next column discusses some examples 
of both entity-specific and external qualitative factors qualitative factors.
•
The nature of the risk or opportunity
•
The extent to which the entity’s business model 
and strategy depend on particular resources or 
relationships—for example, relationships with 
important suppliers or customers
•
Unexpected variation or change in trends. 
Entity-specific qualitative factors
•
The entity’s geographical location 
•
The entity’s industry or sector
•
The state of the economy or economies in 
which the entity operates.
External qualitative factors
While determining whether information is material, an entity considers both quantitative and qualitative 
factors, however. the presence of a qualitative factor is likely to lower the threshold for a quantitative 
assessment. The more significant the qualitative factors, the more likely it is that lower quantitative 
thresholds will apply. While, in some circumstances a quantitative threshold could be reduced to zero 
and the information would still be material as it is expected to influence primary users’ decisions. Thus, 
an entity needs to identify information as material based on one or more quantitative or qualitative 
factors.
•
Consideration of possible future events with uncertain outcomes: When assessing whether 
information about events is material, IFRS S1 requires an entity to consider the range of possible 
outcomes and the likelihood of the possible outcomes. When considering possible outcomes, an entity is 
required to consider all pertinent facts and circumstances. An entity is more likely to conclude that 
information about a possible future event is material if the potential effects are significant and the event 
is likely to occur.  Information about a possible future event that is expected to affect an entity’s cash 
flows many years in the future is less likely to be material than information about a possible future event 
with similar effects that has the possibility of occurring sooner.

Step 3: Organise the information within the draft sustainability-related 
financial disclosures
An entity should organise a preliminary set of material information in the draft sustainability-related 
financial disclosures in a way that communicates information clearly and concisely to primary users. An 
entity needs to exercise judgement while organising material information, including those related to: 
•
Aggregating and disaggregating information: An entity is required to consider all facts and 
circumstances and decide how to aggregate and disaggregate information in its sustainability-related 
financial disclosures. While aggregating an entity should consider that aggregating would not obscure 
information that is material and aggregated items only if information has shared characteristics. 
Further, the entity might need to disaggregate information about sustainability-related risks and 
opportunities.
•
Obscuring information: IFRS S1 requires an entity to clearly identify its sustainability-related 
financial disclosures and distinguish these disclosures from other information so it cannot obscure 
material information.
The output of Step 3 is the draft sustainability-related financial disclosures.

•
Consideration of changed circumstances and assumptions: An entity should make new, and 
reassess old, materiality judgements at each reporting date, considering changed circumstances and 
assumptions. Such changes can relate to changes in the entity’s individual circumstances or in the 
external environment. Changed circumstances and assumptions might impact materiality of the 
information included in sustainability-related financial disclosures. An entity is required to reassess its 
materiality judgements at each reporting date to consider any changes in circumstances and 
assumptions. If an entity is exposed to a sustainability-related risk or opportunity that might have 
consequences in the long term, the entity should disclose the material information about this 
sustainability-related risk or opportunity.
The output of Step 2 is a preliminary set of material information.
•
Disclosing material information: If an entity concludes that information that is necessary to enable 
primary users to understand the effects of a sustainability-related risk or opportunity on the entity’s 
prospects is material, then an entity should disclose such information, regardless of whether it is 
specifically required by an ISSB Standard. An entity makes judgements about whether this 
information is material in the same way it makes judgements about other types of information that is, 
based on the expectation of whether the information could reasonably be expected to influence 
primary users’ decisions.

Step 4: Review the draft sustainability-related financial disclosures
As a last step, the entity ‘steps back’ and considers its sustainability-related financial disclosures as a 
whole to ensure that it has complied with the requirements related to connected information, such as 
whether primary users will understand connections between the disclosures in its sustainability-related 
financial disclosures and other disclosures that are part of general-purpose financial reports. 
An entity assesses whether information is material both individually and in combination with other 
information in the context of its whole sustainability-related financial disclosures. The following chart 
summarises considerations an entity might make while reviewing draft sustainability-related financial 
disclosures:
The output of Step 4 is the final sustainability-related financial disclosures.
In performing this review, the entity 
considers whether:
The review might lead to:
Additional information being provided in the 
sustainability-related financial disclosures.
Greater aggregation or disaggregation of 
information.
Information that is identified as immaterial being 
removed from the sustainability-related financial 
disclosures to avoid obscuring material information.
Information being reorganised within the 
sustainability-related financial disclosures.
All relevant relationships between different items of 
information have been identified. Identifying new 
relationships between information might lead to that 
information being identified as material for the first 
time.
Items of information that are individually immaterial, 
when considered together, could nevertheless 
reasonably be expected to influence primary users’ 
decisions.
The information in the sustainability-related financial 
disclosures is communicated in an effective, 
understandable way, and organised to avoid 
obscuring material information.
The sustainability-related financial disclosures 
provide a fair presentation of the entity’s 
sustainability-related risks and opportunities.
(Source: ISSB’s Education material: Sustainability-related risks and opportunities and the disclosure of 
material information, November 2024)
The review of draft sustainability disclosures might lead an entity to reconsider its assessment in and 
decide to reassess some information, which might conclude that information previously identified as 
material and remove it from its sustainability-related financial disclosures.

When applying ISSB Standards, an entity is 
required to provide information in a manner that 
enables primary users to understand the 
connections between disclosures provided across 
its sustainability-related financial disclosures and 
its related financial statements. In addition, an 
entity needs to consider materiality in context of 
sustainability-related financial disclosures. ISSB 
Standards are designed to result in an entity 
providing information that is useful for the primary 
users of general-purpose financial reports. 
The entities reporting in accordance with ISSB 
Standards should consider developing a process 
to identify and disclose material information about 
the sustainability-related risks and opportunities it 
has identified and to ensure that it has complied 
with the requirements of ISSB standards.

On 7 February 2025, the Securities Exchange 
Board of India (SEBI) issued a consultation paper 
to review aspects relating to secretarial compliance 
report, appointment of auditors and Related Party 
Transactions (RPT) of a listed entity (the 
consultation paper). The consultation paper seeks 
public feedback on proposed amendments to the 
SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure 
Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (LODR 
Regulations) and SEBI (Share Based Employee 
Benefits and Sweat Equity) Regulations, 2021 
(SBEBS Regulations) and is open for comments 
until 28 February 2025.
The key amendments  proposed are as follows:
1. Strengthening the secretarial compliance 
report: Regulation 24A(2) of the LODR 
Regulations requires every listed entity to submit 
a secretarial compliance report to stock 
exchanges every year in the specified format. 
However, to enhance secretarial compliance by 
listed entities, SEBI proposed following 
amendments relating to secretarial audit and 
secretarial compliance report:
a) Disclosure of Annual Secretarial Compliance 
Report (ASCR) in the annual report 
b) Mandatory compliance with secretarial 
standards referred under Section 118(10) of 
the Companies Act, 2013 (2013 Act)
c) Change in or resignation of a secretarial 
auditor will be deemed to be a material event 
requiring disclosure without application of 
materiality guidelines as per Schedule III of 
the LODR Regulations
d) Total fees paid by listed entity and its 
subsidiaries to a secretarial auditor along with 
the fact about the resignation or removal of a 
secretarial auditor before end of tenure with 
reasons thereof to be disclosed in the annual 
report as per Schedule V of the LODR 
Regulations
e) Removal of duplication in certifications 
between ASCR and requirements in other 
SEBI Regulations.
2. Eligibility criteria for appointment of 
statutory auditor and disclosure to audit 
committee and board of directors: Regulation 
36(5) of the LODR Regulations outlines specific 
disclosure requirements for the notice to be sent 
to shareholders for an annual general meeting 
when appointing or re-appointing statutory or 
secretarial auditors. However, considering that 
the current requirement does not specify the 
standardised format for these disclosures and 
does not mandate minimum information 
disclosure to the Audit Committee or Board of 
Directors, SEBI proposed to prescribe the format 
for disclosure of minimum information to the 
Audit Committee and/or Board of Directors, 
shareholders of the listed entity for considering 
appointment or re-appointment of statutory or 
secretarial auditors of the listed entity. 
3. Approval of RPTs undertaken by subsidiaries 
of listed entity: Regulation 23(2) of the LODR 
requires prescribes ‘approval requirements’ 
relating to RPT involving a subsidiary of a listed 
entity. However, to further clarify the applicability 
of monetary thresholds, SEBI proposed to 
introduce monetary thresholds of INR1,000 crore 
for audit committee approval of RPTs in addition 
to the existing percentage-based threshold (10 
per cent of the annual standalone turnover) 
where the lower of the two thresholds (monetary 
or percentage-based) will be used to determine 
the need for audit committee approval. In case of 
SME listed entities, INR50 crore threshold would 
be applicable. 
Additionally, in case of subsidiaries which do not 
have financial track record i.e. published 
financial statements for at least one year, it is 
proposed to consider 10 per cent of the certified 
net worth on standalone basis instead of10 per 
cent of standalone turnover, as the threshold for 
audit committee approval. In cases of negative 
net worth, the share capital plus securities 
premium will be considered as the threshold 
instead of net worth. This threshold would be 
compared with INR 1,000 crore (or INR50 crore) 
i.e. lower of monetary threshold and percentage-
based threshold, may be considered for 
approval of RPTs by an audit committee. 
4. Clarifications pertaining to applicability of 
RPT provisions: Regulation 2(1)(zc) of the 
LODR Regulations defines an RPT as any 
transaction between a listed entity (or its 
subsidiaries) and a related party of the listed 
entity (or its subsidiaries). In this regard, SEBI 
received requests for clarification on how this 
definition applies to subsidiaries of listed entities 
for RPT compliance. Considering that, SEBI 
proposed to provide following clarifications:
i. To determine related parties for subsidiaries - 
definition of RPT (Regulation 2(1)(zc)) should 
be read along with definition of a related party 
(Regulation 2(1)(zb)) 
ii. The exemption under Regulation 23(5)(b) will 
apply only when the wholly owned 
subsidiary’s accounts are consolidated with a 
listed holding company and presented to 
shareholders. Further, SEBI proposes to 
clarify that the exemption applies only to listed 
holding companies.

Recently, SEBI issued the ‘Industry Standards 
Recognition Manual’ to outline guidelines for 
recognising industry standards to facilitate 
compliance with regulatory directions for various 
regulated entities like Market Infrastructure 
Institutions (MIIs), Mutual Funds, and listed 
companies and it provides for the creation and 
regulation of Industry Standards Forums (ISFs) to 
develop specific standards, checklists, and 
Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for 
implementation of the various regulatory 
directions. 
Key points of the manual include:
•
Scope of ISF: Formulating standards for 
regulatory compliance, not drafting regulations 
or taking regulatory actions.
•
Constitution of ISF: Comprising members of 
the concerned industry or regulated entities, 
including small and medium-sized players, with 
a chairperson having at least 10 years of 
relevant experience.
•
Functioning of ISF: Preparing of 
implementation standards in consultations with 
SEBI for the identified regulatory directive 
and/or suggest additional directives for framing 
of standards. 
•
Recognition process: Standards must be 
specific, aligned with regulatory intent, and 
include step-by-step implementation 
procedures.
•
Publishing standards: Recognised standards 
would be published on SEBI and industry 
association websites and must be adopted by 
regulated entities.
The manual aims to ensure uniformity and ease of 
compliance while allowing SEBI to modify 
guidelines as needed.

Regulation 23 of the SEBI LODR Regulations 
require Related Party Transactions (RPTs) to be 
approved by the audit committee and by the 
shareholders, if material. Additionally, Part A and 
Part B of Section III-B of the SEBI Master Circular 
dated 11 November 2024 (Master Circular) specify 
the information that should be placed before the 
audit committee and shareholders, respectively, 
for consideration of RPTs. Considering these 
requirements, SEBI on 14 February 2025 issued a 
circular, wherein it has provided that, the Industry 
Standards Forum1 (ISF) to introduce standards for 
minimum information to be provided for review by 
an audit committee and shareholders for approval 
of RPTs which will enable listed entities comply 
with requirements of LODR Regulations and SEBI 
Master circular.
Considering the circular, ISF introduced ‘Industry 
Standards on minimum information to be provided 
for review of the audit committee and shareholders 
for approval of RPT’. The standards provide a 
standard format for listed entities to provide 
minimum information to the audit committee and 
shareholders for RPTs entered into on or after 
1 April 2025. The industry standard covers the 
following aspects:
1. Applicability: The standards are applicable to 
material RPTs as defined under the SEBI 
LODR Regulations and where the 
transaction(s) to be entered into individually or 
taken together with previous transactions during 
a financial year, exceed lower of the following: 
a) Two per cent of turnover, as per the last 
audited consolidated financial statements of 
the listed entity
b) Two per cent of net worth, as per the last 
audited consolidated financial statements of 
the listed entity, except in case the arithmetic 
value of the net worth is negative
c) Five per cent of the average of absolute 
value of profit or loss after tax, as per the last 
three audited consolidated financial 
statements of the listed entity. 
2. Minimum information: Specifies minimum 
information required for audit committee’s and 
shareholders’ review and approval of RPTs.
3. Format for information: Provides standardised 
format for presentation of information to the 
audit committee.

In May 2024, SEBI issued a master circular for 
Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) 
Rating Providers (ERPs). The master circular 
mandates ERPs to monitor significant 
developments or events that could alter the ESG 
profile of a rated company. Such events include 
the publication of the Business Responsibility and 
Sustainability Report (BRSR) or any controversies 
and penalties related to ESG areas. ERPs are 
required to review ESG ratings immediately, but 
no later than 10 days after such events.
However, stakeholders have raised concerns 
about the feasibility of reviewing ESG ratings for 
numerous listed companies within the 10 days 
timeframe following the publication of the BRSR. 
Considering these challenges and aiming to 
facilitate ease of doing business, SEBI issued a 
circular on 17 January 2025 to extend the review 
timeline for ESG ratings following the publication 
of the BRSR to 45 days.
This extension is expected to provide ERPs with 
sufficient time to conduct thorough reviews and 
ensuring more accurate and reliable ESG ratings.

Asset reconstruction companies (ARCs) play a 
crucial role in the financial system by taking over 
Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) from banks, 
allowing lenders to focus on core banking 
activities. However, ARCs often face challenges in 
recovering dues from borrowers, making 
settlements a common solution. 
Considering the challenges, on 20 January 2025, 
the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) introduced 
revised guidelines to prescribe more structured 
and detailed framework for the settlement of dues 
by ARCs. Key changes include:
1.
Board approved settlement policy: 
The requirement for a board-approved policy 
covering specific aspects of settlement, such 
as cut-off date for one-time settlement 
eligibility, methodology for arriving at the 
realisable value of the security, etc.
2.
Settlement procedure: The criteria for 
settlement of dues are now divided into three 
categories:
a) Principal amounts exceeding INR1 crore: 
Requires forming the Independent Advisory 
Committee (IAC) consisting of professionals 
having technical/finance/legal background. 
Borrowers with outstanding dues exceeding 
INR1 crore, settlement proposal is to be 
reviewed by IAC and recommendations of 
IAC to be considered by the Board of the 
ARC with at least two independent directors. 
The Board must contemplate every avenue 
of recovery before it allows and orders 
settlement.
b) Principal amounts are less than equal to 
INR1 crore: Settlement of accounts to be 
done as per the criteria prescribed by the 
authority in the Board-approved policy, 
subject to specified conditions.
c) Dues from borrowers classified as frauds 
or wilful defaulters: Settlement of accounts 
to be done under same procedures as 
settlement of accounts where principal 
amount exceeds INR1 crore, irrespective of 
value. An ARC may settle without prejudice 
to any criminal action that might be pending 
against such borrowers.
3.
Other legal provisions: All settlements must 
comply with existing laws and regulations. If 
recovery proceedings are ongoing in a judicial 
forum, any settlement must obtain a consent 
decree from the relevant judicial authority.

The SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) 
Regulations, 2012 (AIF Regulations) provide 
guidelines to regulate private pools of capital in 
India. Recently, SEBI issued a consultation paper 
to review Regulation 17(a) of AIF Regulations. 
The paper addresses concerns about the 
shrinking investment opportunities in unlisted debt 
securities due to recent amendments in the LODR 
Regulations, which mandate the listing of non-
convertible debt securities. The key proposals 
include allowing Category II AIFs to invest more 
than 50 per cent of their investible funds in either 
unlisted securities or listed debt securities with a 
credit rating of 'A' or below. 
This aims to expand the investment universe for 
AIFs while maintaining their role in providing 
capital to industries lacking access to traditional 
funding sources. The consultation paper is open 
for comments until 28 February 2025.

Accounting and Auditing Update – February 2025
In June 2023, the International Sustainability 
Standards Board (ISSB) issued, IFRS S1, General 
Requirements for Disclosure of Sustainability-
related Financial Information and IFRS S2, 
Climate-related Disclosures which provide 
requirements related to disclosure of sustainability-
related risks and opportunities, including those 
related to climate, for capital markets. With an aim 
to aid companies in implementing these standards, 
The IFRS Foundation has published a new 
guide, Applying IFRS S1 when reporting only 
climate-related disclosures in accordance with 
IFRS S2, which aims to help companies 
understand how to report only climate-related 
information when applicable using International 
Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) Standards. 
Further, in response to the concerns about data 
availability and readiness, the ISSB introduced 
transition reliefs in IFRS S1 and IFRS S2. As per 
ISSB standards, companies must apply both 
standards together, but paragraph E5 of IFRS S1 
allows them to disclose only climate-related risks 
and opportunities in the first year, following the 
'climate-first' approach.
This transition relief temporarily narrows the scope 
of reporting in accordance with IFRS S1 from the 
requirements of information about all sustainability 
related risks and opportunities that could 
reasonably be expected to affect a company’s 
prospects to the provision of information about only 
climate-related risks and opportunities, giving 
companies time to prepare reports on all 
sustainability related risks and opportunities. 
However, this relief is optional and in case, 
companies have the resources to do so, they may 
report on all sustainability matters as well.

february 2025 ind as 103 business combination provides guidance on accounting for business combinations under the acquisition method business combinations are transactions or events in which a reporting entity acquirer obtains control of one or more businesses the acquiree business combinations are generally complex transactions and amongst the many challenges in accounting of these transactions determining the fair values of acquirees assets liabilities and non controlling interest are particularly challenging when the business combination occurs shortly before the reporting period end or in situations where terms of business combination agreement are complex ind as 103 provides an acquirer a time frame referred to as the measurement period to finalise its initial accounting of the business combination in such situations the acquirer is required to report provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete in its financial statements

is the period after the acquisition date during which the acquirer may adjust the provisional amounts recognised for the business combination measurement period provides entities with a reasonable period of time to obtain the information necessary to identify and measure the following as of the acquisition date in accordance with the requirements of ind as 103 the identifiable assets acquired liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree the consideration transferred for the acquiree or other amount used in measuring goodwill the equity interest in the acquiree previously held by the acquirer if the business combination is achieved in stages the resulting goodwill or gain on a bargain purchase source kpmg in india analysis 2025 based on ind as 103 editorial toc chapter 1 chapter 2 chapter 3 ind as 103 states that the measurement period ends as soon as the acquirer receives the information that it needs or learns that more information is not obtainable and such period cannot exceed one year from the acquisition date is measurement period an open period 06 ind as 103 does not provide specific guidance on determining provisional amounts these amounts are determined based on the available information at the date of acquisition consistent with the recognition and measurement requirements of the standard entities would be expected to make a reasonable effort to determine provisional amounts and it would not be appropriate to assign only nominal amounts or no amounts solely because the acquirer anticipates it is likely to receive additional information about facts and circumstances that existed at the date of acquisition ind as 103 requires the acquirer to consider all pertinent factors in determining whether information obtained after the acquisition date would result in an adjustment to the provisional amounts recognised or whether that information results from events that occurred after the acquisition date some of the pertinent factors are date when additional information is obtained whether the acquirer can identify a reason for a change to provisional amounts information obtained shortly after the acquisition date is more likely to reflect circumstances that existed at the acquisition date than the information obtained several months later for example unless an intervening event that changed its fair value can be identified the sale of an asset to a third party shortly after the acquisition date for an amount that differs significantly from its provisional fair value measured at that date is likely to indicate an error in the provisional amount thus whether an event should be recognised as an adjustment to a provisional amount or as a postcombination event may involve significant judgement an example where an entity may report in its financial statements using provisional amounts during the measurement period would be when an entity has not obtained the final valuation report required to account for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in an acquisition by the time it issues its financial statements for the first reporting period following the business combination measurement period adjustments may affect not only the measurement of assets and liabilities but also their recognition there could also be situations where new information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed at the date of acquisition that may result in recognition of additional assets or liabilities that were not recognised at the acquisition date in other words new information might be obtained about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date but that were unknown at that date this may indicate additional assets or liabilities including those arising from contingencies not recognised in the initial accounting for an acquisition should be recognised as part of the accounting for the business combination what are provisional amounts 2025 kpmg assurance

complete the acquirer is required to disclose the following in its annual financial statements and in any interim financial statements the reasons why the initial accounting for the business combination is incomplete the assets liabilities equity interests or items of consideration for which the initial accounting is incomplete and the nature and amount of any measurement period adjustments recognised during the period adjustment to provisional amounts measurementperiod adjustments are analogous to adjusting events after the reporting date under ind as 10 events after the reporting period ie events that occur after the reporting date but before the financial statements are authorised for issue and that provide evidence of a condition that existed at the reporting date similarly the effects of information that first becomes available during the measurement period and that provides evidence of conditions or circumstances that existed at the date of acquisition are reflected in the accounting at the date of acquisition ie the adjustments are recognised retrospectively as if the accounting was completed at the date of acquisition the acquirer revises its comparative information for prior periods presented in financial statements as needed including making any change in depreciation amortisation or other effects on comprehensive income that arise as a result of the adjustments after the measurement period ends the acquisition accounting is adjusted only to correct an error in accordance with ind as 8 accounting policies changes in accounting

way of the following case studies case study 1 company a acquires company b on 28 february 2024 company a seeks an independent valuation for an item of property plant and equipment ppe acquired in the business combination the valuation for the said ppe was not complete by the time company a issued its financial statements for the year ended 31 march 2024 in its financial statements for the year ended 31 march 2024 company a recognised provisional fair value for such ppe based upon information available as inr30 crore at the acquisition date the said ppe had a remaining useful life of five years five months after the acquisition date company a received the independent valuation which estimated the assets acquisitiondate fair value as inr40 crore evaluation of the measurement period adjustment in the financial statements for year ended 31 march 2025 in the year ended 31 march 2025 a company a would determine the measurement period adjustment of inr983 crore at the acquisition date as follows fair value of inr40 crore less provisional value of inr30 crore ie inr10 crore less the additional depreciation that would have been recognised if the ppe was accounted at inr40 crore at the acquisition date inr1683 lakh for depreciation for a month b company a would retrospectively adjust the prior year information related to the acquisition of company b as follows the carrying amount of ppe as at 31 march 2024 will increase by inr983 crore the carrying amount of goodwill as at 31 march 2024 will decrease by inr10 crore depreciation expense for the year ended 31 march 2024 will increase by inr1683 lakh c in accordance with paragraph b67a of ind as 103 company a would disclose that the comparative information for the year ended 31 march 2024 is adjusted retrospectively to increase the fair value of the item of ppe at the acquisition date by inr983 crore with a corresponding decrease in goodwill of inr10 crore and an increase in depreciation expense of inr1683 lakh it is pertinent to note that company a in its financial statements for the year ended 31 march 2024 would disclose the reasons of why the initial accounting for ppe acquired in the business combination is incomplete editorial toc chapter 1 chapter 2 chapter 3 09 2025 kpmg assurance and consulting services llp an indian limited liability partnership and a member firm of the kpmg global

distinguishing between new information about conditions that existed at the date of acquisition from information that result from events that occur after the date of acquisition could have a significant impact on accounting of business combination this assessment involves exercise of significant judgement it is pertinent to note that measurement period does not provide an open oneyear period following the acquisition date to complete the acquisition accounting this is only to provide reasonable time to the acquirer to deal with accounting of complex business combination transaction and ends as soon as the acquirer receives the information it was seeking about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date or learns that more information is not available in no circumstances should the measurement period exceed one year from the acquisition date as the standards do not provide elaborate guidance to determine provisional amounts this requires companies to make reasonable efforts and significant judgement to determine these amounts appropriately based upon information available as at the acquisition date further the entities should provide comprehensive disclosures about the items for which the business combination accounting has not been completed along with reasons and the nature and amount of any measurementperiod adjustments recognised during the period the bottom line editorial toc chapter 1 chapter 2 chapter 3 case study 2 company a acquires company b on 28 february 2024 in its financial statements for the year ended 31 march 2024 company a accounted for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at provisional fair values in april 2025 company a obtained new information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that if known would have resulted in the recognition of an additional liability at that date evaluation of the measurement period adjustment in the financial statements for year ended 31 march 2025 in this case the measurement period ended on 28 february 2025 ie one year from the acquisition date management obtained the new information about facts and circumstances that existed as at the acquisition date in april 2025 ie after the end of measurement period and concluded that such adjustment is not resulting from an error in the business combination accounting in this case because the measurement period has ended and the adjustment resulting from the new information is not due to an error company a would not adjust the business combination accounting instead company a would treat the new information as a subsequent event with respect to its financial statements for the year ended 31 march 2025 accordingly the financial statements for the year ended 31 march 2025 would reflect the effect of the adjustment resulting from the new information in financial statements for the year ended 31 march 2025 by recognising the additional liability through a charge to statement of profit and loss chapter 2 sustainability reporting disclosure of material information this article aims to discuss the guidance on disclosure of material information related to sustainability related risks and opportunities 10 accounting and auditing update february 2025 editorial toc chapter 1 chapter 2 chapter 3 in continuation of our previous article in january 2025 edition this article aims to

ifrs s1 general requirements for disclosure of sustainabilityrelated financial information ifrs s1 ifrs s2 climaterelated disclosures ifrs s2 in november 2024 the issb issued an education material sustainabilityrelated risks and opportunities and the disclosure of material information the standards require companies to disclose material information about the sustainabilityrelated risks and opportunities that could reasonably be expected to affect entitys prospects the educational material explains the requirements related to identifying and disclosing material information about sustainabilityrelated risks and opportunities that could reasonably be expected to affect an entitys prospects the educational material is structured into three sections chapter 1 the definition of material information and its application in issb standards discusses the main components of the definition of material information to enable an understanding of the use of this term and how to make materiality judgements in that context chapter 2 sustainabilityrelated risks and opportunities that could reasonably be expected to affect an entitys prospects and its application in issb standards discusses what sustainabilityrelated risks and opportunities are and how they could reasonably be expected to affect an entitys prospects to enable an understanding of how this concept is used in issb

english company limited by guarantee all rights reserved accounting and auditing update february 2025 editorial toc chapter 1 chapter 2 chapter 3 the standard requires entities to provide material information about an entitys sustainabilityrelated risks and opportunities to help meet the information needs of primary users the information is considered material when omitting misstating or obscuring that information could reasonably be expected to influence primary users decisions however the distinct scope of the reported information including differences in relevant time horizons and the types of information required to meet the respective objectives of sustainabilityrelated financial disclosures and the related financial statements requires that distinct materiality judgements should be used for those disclosures and for the related financial statements in relation to definition of material information the education material provides following guidance relating to main components of the definition information needs of primary users and the decisions they make based on general purpose financial reports materiality judgements involve considerations relating to both who the primary users are and what decisions they make based on general purpose financial reports general purpose financial reports do not and cannot provide all the information that all primary users need therefore an entity should meet the common information needs of primary users additionally an entity assesses whether information is material based on whether that information could reasonably be expected to influence decisions of primary users although the entity itself makes this assessment it is based on the perspective of primary users and their information needs the materiality assessment requires an entity to consider the characteristics of primary users such as potential investors while also considering the entitys own circumstances for example the entitys own industry in the context of sustainabilityrelated financial disclosures sustainabilityrelated financial disclosures provide information about an entitys sustainability related risks and opportunities that is useful to primary users of generalpurpose financial reports in making decisions about providing resources to the entity although the definition of material information in issb standards is aligned with the definition of the same term in ifrs accounting standards however the information required to meet the objective of the respective general purpose financial reports is distinct the materiality judgements an entity makes in preparing its sustainabilityrelated financial disclosures will be distinct from those it makes in preparing its financial statements meaning of omitting misstating or obscuring information in assessing whether information is material an entity considers the effect of omitting misstating or obscuring that information on primary users decisions an entity is required to identify its sustainabilityrelated financial disclosures clearly and distinguish them from other information the entity provides therefore an entity should ensure that sustainabilityrelated financial disclosures are clearly identifiable and not obscured by additional information the definition of material information 12 2025 kpmg assurance and consulting services llp an indian limited liability

risks and opportunities and the disclosure of material information november 2024 step 1 identify information about sustainabilityrelated risks and opportunities that has the potential to be material considering the requirements of issb standards the education material states that as first step an entity should identify information about its sustainabilityrelated risks and opportunities that primary users might need to understand to make decisions relating to providing resources to the entity once the entity has identified a sustainabilityrelated risk or opportunity an entity should apply the issb standard requirements that specifically applies to identified sustainabilityrelated risk or opportunity further an entity should apply ifrs s2 in combination with ifrs s1 for example if an entity identifies a climate related risk or opportunity then in determining the required level of disaggregation of climaterelated information to provide an entity should refer to the relevant requirements in ifrs s1 the education material also highlights that the disclosure requirements in issb standards specify items of information that an entity is required to provide if that information is material in the entitys circumstances the information to be provided should be useful to primary users in making decisions about providing resources to the entity if an entity determines that information required by an issb standard is not material the entity need not disclose that information in case issb standard does not provide disclosure requirements relating to an entitys identified sustainabilityrelated risk or opportunity in such scenarios ifrs s1 requires that an entity apply judgement to identify information that is relevant to primary users decisionmaking and faithfully represents the sustainabilityrelated risk or opportunity in applying such judgement an entity needs to assess what information is useful to primary users further to help an entity in assessing whether the information is relevant and faithfully represents the identified risk or opportunity ifrs s1 specifies sources of guidance for the identification of relevant and hence potentially material information the output of step 1 is a set of potentially material information editorial toc chapter 1 chapter 2 chapter 3 14 2025 kpmg assurance and consulting services llp an indian limited liability

accounting and auditing update february 2025 step 2 assess whether the potentially material information identified in step 1 is material the education material highlights that in step 2 an entity assesses whether the potentially material information identified in step 1 is in fact material considering that materiality judgements are specific to the entity issb standards do not specify any thresholds for material information or predetermine what information would be material in a particular situation when making materiality judgements an entity considers whether the item of information could reasonably be expected to affect primary users assessment of the amount timing and uncertainty of future net cash inflows to the entity and their assessment of stewardship of the entitys economic resources sufficiently to influence their decisions the education material highlights that following points should be considered when making materiality judgements consideration of quantitative and qualitative factors an entity should assess the materiality of information by considering both quantitative and qualitative factors it would not be appropriate to rely on purely numerical guidelines or to apply a uniform quantitative threshold for all materiality judgements below are some of the considerations o quantitative factors an entity ordinarily assesses whether information is quantitatively material by considering the size of the effect of the sustainabilityrelated risk or opportunity against other related measures examples of quantitative factors might include impact on cash flows amount of resource consumption return on investment or market share a quantitative factor can be used to assess both the materiality of quantitative information such as ghg emissions and also qualitative information such as qualitative information about an entitys resilience to a specific sustainabilityrelated risk o qualitative factors qualitative factors on other hand are factors that an entity considers in making materiality judgements related to characteristic of the entity such as its governance and its interactions with its stakeholders society the economy and the natural environment throughout the entitys value chain that ultimately give rise to sustainabilityrelated risks or opportunities the issb standards highlights that existence of qualitative factor more likely to influence the decisions of primary users therefore when making materiality judgements an entity should consider both entityspecific and external qualitative factors the table on next column discusses some examples of both entityspecific and external qualitative factors qualitative factors the nature of the risk or opportunity the extent to which the entitys business model and strategy depend on particular resources or relationshipsfor example relationships with important suppliers or customers unexpected variation or change in trends entityspecific qualitative factors the entitys geographical location the entitys industry or sector the state of the economy or economies in which the entity operates external qualitative factors while determining whether information is material an entity considers both quantitative and qualitative factors however the presence of a qualitative factor is likely to lower the threshold for a quantitative assessment the more significant the qualitative factors the more likely it is that lower quantitative thresholds will apply while in some circumstances a quantitative threshold could be reduced to zero and the information would still be material as it is expected to influence primary users decisions thus an entity needs to identify information as material based on one or more quantitative or qualitative factors consideration of possible future events with uncertain outcomes when assessing whether information about events is material ifrs s1 requires an entity to consider the range of possible outcomes and the likelihood of the possible outcomes when considering possible outcomes an entity is required to consider all pertinent facts and circumstances an entity is more likely to conclude that information about a possible future event is material if the potential effects are significant and the event is likely to occur information about a possible future event that is expected to affect an entitys cash flows many years in the future is less likely to be material than information about a possible future event with similar effects that has the possibility of occurring sooner source issbs education material

While the country ranks among the top global food producers and exporters, millions still struggle with access to adequate and nutritious food. According to the 2024 Global Hunger Index (GHI), India ranks 105th out of 127 countries, highlighting the persistent challenges of hunger and malnutrition. Additionally, the UN’s State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World (SOFI) report states that over 19.46 crore people—approximately 13.4% of India’s population—are chronically undernourished.
Strengthening India’s public food distribution system (PDS)
One of the key strategies to achieve zero hunger is strengthening India’s public food distribution system (PDS). The Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS) under the National Food Security Act (NFSA) has been instrumental in providing subsidized food grains to millions. However, challenges such as inefficiencies in supply chain management, leakages, and exclusion errors must be addressed through digital reforms, Aadhaar-linked beneficiary tracking, and improved last-mile delivery mechanisms.
Sustainable Agriculture
Sustainable agriculture is another crucial pillar in ensuring long-term food security. Promoting climate-resilient farming practices, enhancing irrigation efficiency, and encouraging crop diversification can help improve productivity while preserving natural resources. Additionally, supporting smallholder farmers through direct income support, improved market linkages, and access to quality seeds and fertilizers will contribute to a more robust food supply system.
Balanced Nutrition
Another major aspect of food security is ensuring balanced nutrition, particularly for vulnerable groups such as children, pregnant women, and lactating mothers. Government programs like the Mid-Day Meal Scheme (MDMS) and the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) play a vital role in addressing malnutrition. Expanding these programs with fortified foods, nutrition education, and community participation can further enhance their impact.
Technology and Innovation
Technology and innovation can also drive improvements in food security. The use of artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, and remote sensing can help monitor food supply chains, reduce wastage, and optimize distribution. Digital platforms connecting farmers directly to consumers can eliminate middlemen, ensuring better prices for farmers and lower costs for consumers.
Additionally, achieving food security and zero hunger requires collaboration across various stakeholders, including government bodies, private sector players, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and international agencies. Public-private partnerships (PPPs) can help scale up successful models of food production, distribution, and nutritional interventions. Global best practices, such as Brazil’s Zero Hunger Program, can offer valuable insights for policy refinement in India.
Lastly, raising awareness about sustainable consumption and reducing food waste are essential. Strengthening food banks, promoting community kitchens, and encouraging responsible consumer behavior can significantly impact food security at the grassroots level.
India has made progress in improving food availability, but significant challenges remain in accessibility and affordability. A multi-pronged approach integrating efficient distribution, sustainable agriculture, nutritional programs, technology-driven solutions, and strong policy frameworks is essential to achieve zero hunger and food security for all. With concerted efforts, India can move closer to eradicating hunger and malnutrition, ensuring a healthier and more prosperous future for its citizens.

The topic of food security has been at the forefront of Indian public policy since the eve of its 
independence. Even though India holds strong position in food production and export 
markets, there are problems in providing access to food and balanced nutrition to all. Global 
Hunger Index (GHI) report of 2024 (where India ranks 105th among 127 countries) and State 
of Food Security and Nutrition in the World (SOFI) report from UN over 19.46 crore (~13.4 per 
cent) people are chronically undernourished in India reflects the seriousness of the food 
insecurity, malnutrition, and hunger. Addressing food insecurity, malnutrition, and hunger 
requires a multi-scale, multi-level, and multi-stakeholder approach across inter-linked 
segments such as agriculture and public food distribution.
India's GHI score has improved from 29.3 in 2016 to 27.3 in 20243, showing considerable progress 
despite the pandemic lockdowns of 2020-2021. Undernutrition is a grave issue in India, with one-
third of the world's malnourished children residing in the country. Children under five years4 show 
high prevalence of malnutrition, with 13.7 per cent undernourished, 35.5 per cent stunted, 18.7 per 
cent wasted and child mortality at 2.9 per cent. As per National Family Health Survey (NFHS) 
published in 2021, anaemia5 affects 67.1 per cent of children (6-59 months) and 52.2 per cent of 
pregnant women (15-49 years) in India. The Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) 
program, initiated in 1975, aims to improve the health, nutrition, and development of children under

The Mid-Day Meal (MDM) scheme, rebranded 
as Pradhan Mantri Poshan Shakti Nirman (PM 
POSHAN)8, has been instrumental in 
addressing the nutritional needs of school-age 
children since 1995. Serving free lunches to 
12.169 crore school children annually, it is one 
of the world's largest school feeding programs. 
This initiative ensures that poverty does not 
hinder education, addressing hunger and 
malnutrition while promoting local food 
production through the School Nutrition Garden 
Scheme. This initiative also complements 
Sustainability Development Goal (SDG) 4 – 
Quality and inclusive education along with Zero 
hunger SDG 2 goal. 
Countries like USA10, European countries 
(Sweden11, Finland12, Estonia13), Brazil14, 
Kenya15 and Rwanda16 are providing free school 
meals to ensure access to healthy diets and 
micronutrient sufficiency. For example, USA17 
and Brazil18 source fresh produce from local 
farms, promoting local agriculture and ensuring 
fresh meals. Finland19 and Japan20 incorporate 
nutrition education into their meal program that 
covers healthy eating habits and balanced diet.
Some of the state governments have taken 
initiative to include eggs, fortified salt, fortified 
cooking oil and millets in the school meals as 
part of Mid-Day Meal Scheme. Karnataka21 
introduced Ragi milk thrice a week in November 
2024, and Odisha22 implemented fortified milk 
(Vitamin A and D) for 44.5 lakh children as pilot 
project in January mid, 2025. Andhra Pradesh23 
extended the mid-day meal scheme to junior 
college students, benefiting 1.5 lakh students in 
addition to 36.6 lakh primary school students, to 
curb dropouts.

Mid-day meal scheme returns to government junior colleges in Andhra Pradesh, The

Iron and folic acid supplementation is provided 
for pregnant and lactating mothers to prevent 
and combat anaemia. POSHAN Abhiyan (earlier 
National Nutrition Mission) including ICDS aims 
at improving the nutritional status of adolescent 
girls, pregnant women and lactating mothers 
across the country since 2018. 
Over 69.4 lakh pregnant women and 42.5 lakh 
lactating women7 are benefitting from the 
POSHAN Abhiyan scheme. Leveraging 
technology such as ICT based platform (Poshan 
Tracker), providing diversified diet including 
millets, developing regional meal plans for 
addressing anaemia and micro-nutrient 
deficiencies have been used to improve the 
efficiency of the mission. Establishing local 
community gardens and sourcing fresh produce, 
developing iron rich diet, meal plan and 
appointing village and/or district level qualified 
nutritionist for regular counselling and 
consultation will improve the nutritional status 
and overall well-being of children and mothers 
in India. These health and nutrition schemes 
can be integrated with National Health Mission 
for holistic healthcare services.
Vulnerable rural and urban households face 
limited access to markets and income disparity, 
restricting their ability to purchase sufficient and 
nutritious food. The SOFI report states that 74 
per cent of the population cannot afford healthy 
diet and 39 per cent lack nutrient-adequate diet 
in India. The National Food Security Act (NFSA) 
of 2013 was a landmark policy reform to drive 
the Public Distribution System (PDS), 
guaranteeing subsidised food grains for 75 per 
cent of the rural and 50 per cent of the urban 
population, with additional provisions for the 
poorest households under the Antyodaya Anna 
Yojana. 
PDS24, the world’s largest food subsidy 
programme covers 80.67 crore people across 
India via over five lakh Fair Price Shops (FPS), 
providing access to essential commodities such 
as wheat, rice, sugar, and kerosene at 
subsidised rates. Similar food subsidy schemes 
are provided by developing nations such as 
Brazil (Zero Hunger Programme or Fome Zero), 
Ethiopia (Productive Safety Net Programme) 
and Bangladesh (Vulnerable Group 
Development (VGD) Programme), however 
India’s PDS remains one of the largest in the 
world. 
Indian PDS is evolving towards targeted public 
distribution system focusing on Below Poverty 
Line (BPL) households, with INR2.05 lakh 
crores allotted for food subsidies in 2024-25 
budget. The use of electronic Point of Sale 
(ePoS) devices, Aadhaar-based authentication, 
digitalisation of records are critical in eliminating 
duplicate ration cards and reducing leakages. 
Going forward, Scheme for Modernisation and 
Reforms through Technology in Public 
Distribution System (SMART-PDS)25 will 
leverage data analysis and cloud technology. 
This scheme will issue smart ration cards and 
authenticate the beneficiary through fingerprint 
recognition. Centralisation of databases of all 
food stock warehouses, distribution centers, and 
direct beneficiaries will be the key for the 
digitalization and SMART-PDS.

SMART-PDS, a technological driven initiative should be implemented in all States/UTs, Press Information Bureau, Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and 
Public Distribution, March 2023 
Ensuring transparency and efficiency is 
challenging of PDS due to leakages. PDS 
leakages has decreased from 41.7 per cent in 
2011 to 22 per cent in 202226, yet over 2.8 crore 
MT of food grains was estimated to be either 
stolen or wasted through PDS leakages in 
2024.Lack of moisture and temperature control, 
pest infestation, poor record-keeping and 
improper handling impacts food quality while 
storing food grains in the warehouses. 
Addressing these issues require inventory and 
route optimisation, geographical planning, 
investments and maintenance of the storage 
and transportation facilities, integrating 
technology in managing, tracking, storing and 
distributing food grains such as GPS tracking 
from farm-warehouse-ration shops, along with 
easier and quicker RTI litigation measures for 
the public. Initiatives such as PM Gati Shakti 
and Anna Chakra are helpful tools that could be 
implemented to optimise of food grains 
movement across supply chain points, minimise 
transportation costs and delivery times.
Rural regions face bigger challenges in food 
distribution due to transportation, storage, and 
resource limitations. Some states27, including 
Andhra Pradesh28, Punjab29 and Delhi30, have 
initiated doorstep delivery of food grains at no 
extra cost to beneficiaries. This approach can 
be carefully assessed and scaled up to specific 
regions with vulnerable populations in remote 
and inaccessible areas, reducing their need to 
visit FPS.
Economic disruptions and movement of workers 
to cities and urban regions makes it difficult for 
migrant workers and their families to access 
subsidised food grains. One Nation, One Ration 
Card (ONORC), which began in 2019 provides 
ration card access from any fair price shops 
(FPS) across the country. ONORC has helped 
reduce mobility costs for migrant workers and 
ensured portability of ration cards. Pradhan 
Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY) 
scheme implemented from April 2020 to 
December 2022 provided food grains free to 
beneficiaries during the COVID-19 period. 
Awareness and education about the ONORC31 
scheme benefits, provision of technology and 
infrastructure such as internet, robust ePoS 
devices for biometric authentication could 
improve the PMGKAY and ONORC schemes 
uptake by all the eligible beneficiaries.

Department of Food and Public Distribution, Government of India signs Memorandum of Understandings with SIDBI and NIESBUD for transformation of Fair 
Price Shops, Press Information Bureau, Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution, March 2024 
India is being a large importer of pulses, oil 
seeds, vegetable oils, fruits, and nuts with a 
substantial gap between domestic supply and 
demand. Maintaining sufficient stocks of 
essential staple foods (rice, wheat, and pulses) 
is essential for guaranteeing the food security 
during uncertain situations crisis and natural 
disasters. National Food Security Mission 
(NFSM)35 boosts food production, mainly staple 
crops such as rice, wheat, pulses, and coarse 
cereals by enhancing the area of production and 
crop productivity. NFSM targets rice production 
around one crore MT, wheat at 80 lakh MT to 
stabilise prices, coarse cereals (maize, barley) 
at 30 lakh MT, nutri-cereals (millets) at 20 lakh 
MT, enhancing targets for pulses as 40 lakh MT 
and oilseeds at 20 lakh MT. 
However, over dependency on imports36 for 
pulses and oil seeds risks the food security. In 
2023, agricultural imports were valued at 
USD3300 crores, with vegetable oils accounting 
for USD1710 crores, representing a heavy 
dependence on imported sources. Despite 
being a major producer of pulses, India’s 
imports have increased by 44 per cent in 2023 
compared to 2022. This highlights the need for 
improvement in domestic agricultural practices 
and infrastructure to ensure food security. 
Strategies to tackle inflation and food 
insufficiency include close monitoring of food 
prices, agricultural partnerships for imports, and 
incentivising pulse production through initiatives 
such as the Price Support Scheme (PSS) and 
the Price Stabilisation Fund (PSF). PSF helps 
control price volatility by maintaining a buffer 
stock of pulses and PSS ensures farmers 
receive a minimum support price for their 
produce including pulses.
NFSM-Pulses, PM-AASHA, crop insurance, 
crop rotation, and subsidies for seeds, 
fertilisers, and agri inputs support boosting pulse 
production. NFSM assists farmers with high-
yielding variety seeds and demonstration 
programmes, while PM-AASHA offers MSP 
price support and compensation if market prices 
fall below MSP. Research on resilient pulse 
varieties, hybrid seeds, crop insurance 
schemes, and crop rotation promotion are 
crucial for achieving self-sufficiency in pulse 
production. Climate change monitoring teams 
and climate-resilient sustainable agriculture and 
irrigation technologies are needed to mitigate 
climate change risks.
Achieving food and nutritional security in India 
calls for a holistic and integrated approach that 
addresses the diverse needs of its population. 
By leveraging existing programmes, technology, 
and fostering community participation, India can 
make noteworthy progress towards zero 
hunger, food security and improved nutrition. 
Collaborative efforts across agriculture, 
livestock, education, and public distribution 
systems are essential to create a resilient and 
sustainable food system that can adapt to 
climate change, consumer preferences and 
ensure their well-being. This comprehensive 
strategy aligns with the Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs) and paves the way 
for a healthier and more prosperous future 
for India.

https://kpmg.com/in/en/insights/2025/02/financial-crime-bulletin.html,Financial Crime Bulletin,Dive deep into the financial crime avenues and stay up-to-date with Indian and global regulatory initiatives,2025-02-10 00:00:00,"Financial crimes have become an ever-evolving problem. Methods of perpetrating such crimes are going beyond traditional avenues and increasing in sophistication and technological integration, posing new challenges for financial institutions (FIs). Around USD3.1 trillion in illicit funds and USD485.6 billion in fraud scams and bank fraud schemes is estimated to have happened in 2023 alone with technology playing a major role in helping such crimes. 
In 2024, we saw some major regulatory initiatives/enactments with the U.S.A. enacting the Corporate Transparency Act (CTA), while the European Union introduced the AML Package, including the establishment of the Anti-Money Laundering Authority (AMLA), a new 6th Anti-Money Laundering Directive, and updated Transfer of Funds Regulations (TFRs) for crypto asset transfers. The U.K. has rolled out the Economic Crime Plan 2 (ECP2) and the G7 countries are working on AI regulations to combat financial crimes more effectively.
Corporate Transparency Act (CTA)2

Effective 1 January 2024, The U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) has started accepting beneficial ownership information reports under the Corporate Transparency Act (CTA). Existing companies must file by 1 January 2025, while new companies have 90 days from creation or registration to file beneficial ownership information such as name, date of birth, address, and identification number.
DOJ AML Policy Initiatives3

On 15 April 2024, the Department of Justice has introduced a pilot programme offering non-prosecution agreements (NPAs) to individuals who voluntarily disclose original information about corporate and white-collar crimes. The programme incentivises reporting by providing immunity in exchange for cooperation, including full disclosure, assistance in investigations, and restitution for disclosures made on or after 15 April 2024.











AML (Anti Money Laundering) Compliance for Securities Market15


On 6 June 2024, SEBI updated AML compliance requirements for securities market intermediaries, including enhanced due diligence and transaction monitoring. This aims to strengthen the integrity of the securities market and prevent financial crimes.
Internal Risk Assessment guidance for money laundering/terrorist financing risks16

The Reserve Bank of India issued comprehensive guidelines on 10 October 2024, for internal risk assessments by banks, NBFCs, and regulated entities to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and proliferation financing. These guidelines aim to streamline the AML/TF risk assessment process, enhance operational efficiency, and align with global standards. They address sector-specific risks and provide a detailed methodology for risk identification. This move equips financial institutions to manage current and future financial crime challenges effectively.
Fraud Risk Management in Commercial Banks (including Regional Rural Banks) and All India Financial Institutions17

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) issued the Master Directions on Fraud Risk Management in Commercial Banks (including Regional Rural Banks) and All India Financial Institutions (AIFIs) on 15 July 2024. These directions aim to provide a robust framework for the prevention, early detection, and timely reporting of frauds
You may refer our analysis of the said Master Directions by clicking here.
Brokers' institutional mechanism for prevention and detection of fraud or market abuse18

On 4 July 2024, SEBI introduced measures focusing on brokers' institutional mechanisms for the prevention and detection of fraud or market abuse like surveillance systems, employee obligations, escalation and reporting mechanisms, whistleblower policy, implementation standards, and compliance timeline as these provisions will be phased on broker size, with effective dates ranging from 1 January 2025, to 1 April 2026.
We are already witnessing changes in the Financial Services landscape as result of Web 3.0 and digital payment advancements streamlining transactions. Such changes also provide fraudsters / criminals with advanced tools for more effective scams. Such evolutions in technology offers new avenues for deceptive tactics, from phishing scams utilising artificial intelligence to complex hacking methods that exploit blockchain vulnerabilities. 




The financial crime landscape will continue to evolve, and staying ahead requires a proactive approach, leveraging the latest technologies and consistently updating strategies. It’s an arms race, but with the right tool and knowledge, FIs can effectively combat these emerging threats. In times to come, it is expected that regulatory changes will continue encompass and embrace the challenges posed by such emerging technologies.

Foreword
A key theme from this year’s research is the perception among 
tech executives that they are struggling to keep up with the pace 
of change. In response to this sense of falling behind, organizations 
may be tempted to make a hurried response. However, this can lead 
to misguided investments that may prove both risky and expensive, 
potentially increasing the burden of technical debt which many 
well-established organizations are already struggling with.
Our research suggests that organizations are increasingly aware of 
this dilemma, and they are looking to pivot from imitating others to 
becoming leaders themselves. Typically, technology leaders are paving 
the way by bringing structure, discipline and an enterprise mindset to 
the adoption of new technology.
In doing so, they are looking to evidence-based investment decisions 
that align to the broader business and technology strategies and balance 
value creation with appetite for risk.
Overall, the sense from our respondents is that organizations are 
doing well with measurable improvement in many areas over the 
past year. Mistakes provide great learning opportunities for the 
future, and the positive perspective on progress shared by our 
survey participants is encouraging.
2,450
technology professionals worldwide 
from a variety of industries
The relentless speed of technology innovation is undeniable. When combined with a natural fear of missing out, 
ideas that may once have seemed like science fiction are rapidly converting into tangible reality. From generative AI 
to quantum computing, the potential benefits are huge, and so is the risk of making costly mistakes.
By taking a measured approach to technology investment, executives 
are already benefiting from key advancements while keeping a firm 
hold on their business models and successfully running the enterprise. 
A willingness to enter the realm of science fiction does not mean leaving 
the facts of sound business management behind.

Foreword
Identifying value amid the hype
To harness the full potential of the 
wave of new tech advancements, 
organizations must sustain a measured, 
strategic approach to investment.
Rapid change is driving fear of missing out (FOMO) 
Our research shows that the rapidly accelerated technology 
innovation over the past year has amplified a strong sense of FOMO 
among organizations. 
The flood of AI-related news entering the mainstream has stirred 
a collective interest in AI that transcends seniority and technical 
expertise. This has only served to stoke the fires of ‘tech-envy’ and 
could encourage a ‘spend now, ask questions later’ attitude.
Digital transformation can bring many exciting benefits, and 
ambition to progress is only healthy, but organizations must not let 
it distort their judgement. Progress paranoia could lead to misguided 
investments and disjointed implementation initiatives. 
Despite FOMO, organizations are taking a more 
balanced approach to investment decisions
While execs continue to look at the trends set by their market peers 
for guidance, this year sees more of them basing investment decisions 
on their own primary evidence. 
This year, executives are drawing on a wider range of sources to 
inform their investment decisions. All investment drivers measured in 
Tapping into the pace of change 
is something we are focused 
on and excited about, all in the 
context of doing so in a safe 
and secure way.

complain that their senior 
leadership’s risk aversion 
means their organization is 
slower than competitors to 
embrace new technology
2023 have seen an increase in prevalence for 2024 by an average of 
15 percentage points. 
That said, the drivers have shifted in terms of which has the strongest 
influence on tech choices. While following competitors is still a top 
decision driver in 2024, it has fallen to third behind looking to third-party 
guidance (89 percent) and in-house trials and proof of concept (PoC; 
83 percent of the base). This may reflect the desire for organizations to 
overtake competitors in getting emerging tech to market.
Still, for many, FOMO remains a strong influence on investment 
decisions: 82 percent are still choosing tech investments such 
as virtual and augmented reality (VR and AR) in order to follow 
in their competitors’ footsteps. In comparison, the study’s digital 
transformation high performers are 22 percentage points more likely 
than other organizations to rely on customer feedback. And these 
leading organizations place following competitors outside of their top 
three motivations for investing in certain tech.

Organizations are spreading their bets across the  
tech portfolio
Compared to 2023, tech implementation maturity has improved across 
the board, with the biggest increases seen in data analytics and XaaS. 
In the 2023 tech report the most common implementation stage 
for XaaS was that companies had a strategic vision but were limited 
because of low buy-in or investment approvals. This year, the majority of 
organizations are proactive in progressing against their XaaS strategies. 
Priorities for further 
investment over the next 
year include XaaS, which 
86% 
chose, as organizations 
focus on the agility and cost 
reductions enabled by cloud 
computing.
Across all tech, ASPAC is the region that is most likely to be at the 
proactive implementation stage, with India and China leading the way. 
Priorities for further investment over the next year include XaaS, 
which 86 percent chose, as organizations focus on the agility and 
cost reductions enabled by cloud computing. Other priorities include 
cybersecurity (68 percent), AI/automation (65 percent) and edge 
computing (61 percent). These investment appetites indicate that 
many organizations put tech at the core of their business strategies.

74 percent of organizations say that over the next 12 months, 
they plan to focus on investing in new tech rather than on 
enhancing the value of their existing tech suite. 
There is a risk that the allure of new technologies distracts 
organizations from addressing flaws and technical debt in 
their existing systems. This approach can, in turn, undermine 
transformation progress. 
Often, unresolved issues in current tech infrastructure can 
obstruct the implementation of emerging tech. 
In fact, unaddressed tech debt blocking the path to new 
upgrades is one of the top challenges holding back the digital 
transformation progress of the study’s digital transformation 
high performers. Further, 57 percent of organizations overall say 
that flaws in their foundational enterprise IT systems disrupt 
business-as-usual on a weekly basis. 
“The longer you delay addressing tech debt, the higher the costs 
and risks become,” says Commonwealth Bank of Australia’s 
Gavin Munroe. “Continuous investment is crucial. Accumulated 
tech debt often results in embedded business rules and logic, 
which can make future replacements costly and complex. So, 
it’s essential to consistently invest in unraveling tech debt to 
avoid escalating surprise costs and complexity over time.” 
Organizations must strike a healthy balance between new and 
existing tech investments. Executives’ intentions to prioritize 
XaaS investments will help here. By replacing outdated systems 
and consolidating multiple functions into centralized hubs, XaaS 
platforms can reduce the complexity of infrastructures and the 
volume of redundant tech.
Less likely to be gripped by FOMO:  
In comparison to non-leaders, our leader group is 23 percentage points 
less likely to worry about keeping up with the pace of change. Also, they 
are five percentage points less likely than the mainstream group to be 
choosing technologies because their competitors have already done so. 
Iteratively course-correcting: 
High-performing organizations are adopting a more proactive and 
adaptive approach to evaluating tech investments. As many as 83 percent 
of leaders continuously evaluate the business value and outcomes of all 
tech investments, which is 17 percentage points higher than non-leaders. 
This always-on approach will provide organizations with more opportunity 
to intervene and optimize where required.
Utilizing primary empirical evidence: 
Leaders are 21 percentage points more likely than non-leaders to run 
calculations to forecast the potential value of tech initiative before 
they invest. 
Leaning on external sources of expertise:  
To enhance their digital transformation decision-making, 93 percent of 
our leader group plan to expand and strengthen their ecosystem and 
partnerships, compared with 70 percent of the mainstream sample.
Aware of tech debt: 
In contrast with non-leaders, leading organizations place unaddressed 
tech debt as one of the top challenges holding back digital transformation 
progress. To avoid escalating surprise costs and complexity over time, 
organizations must consistently invest in unraveling tech debt.
57%
of organizations say that 
flaws in their foundational 
enterprise IT systems disrupt 
business-as-usual on a 
weekly basis.

Foreword
Optimizing value through evidence-based decisions
When measuring the effectiveness of 
digital transformation or the adoption 
of a certain piece of tech, it’s 
important not to get fixated on just 
one metric. You have to think about 
the implications a metric may have 
on other metrics, and adjust your 
approach accordingly. 
Naveen Zutshi 
CIO, Databricks
On balance, organizations are content 
with the outcomes of their digital 
transformation investments, mostly 
thanks to their ability to make sound 
decisions along the journey. 
With the pace of change pressuring tech 
execs, organizations must ensure haste 
does not compromise the quality of 
their judgment calls.
Investing for the long term is still a good discipline 
to follow
With execs fearing that their organizations are struggling to keep 
up with the pace of change, planning for the long term can be 
difficult when balancing the needs of the latest technological 
advancements. To maximize progress, tech execs should channel 
digital transformation efforts towards what matters most strategically 
to their organizations. 
“Where we’ve seen organizations achieving the most value from 
tech is where they step away from the habit of just following a tech 
trend for the sake of it,” says Michelle Chang, CFO/CVP of Microsoft 
Customer and Partner Solutions. “And, instead, start with, ‘What 
is our business trying to accomplish, what’s our purpose and what 
problems are blocking us from achieving our purpose?’ The answers 
to these questions will indicate how tech can help them move 
forward in a meaningful way.” 
Our study’s top performers get this, with 53 percent strategically 
evaluating their tech investment portfolio to ensure it is aligned 
with their long-term goals (compared with 41 percent of other 
organizations). The good news is that most execs want to imbue 
their tech initiatives to provide value in non-tech areas; 70 percent 
ensure that their tech investments directly target their sustainability 
and social responsibilities. 
Executives understand that the value of tech goes beyond financial 
gain. “One of the lessons we’ve learnt is that tech initiatives cannot 
just be anchored in financial ROI — that’s not the only win available,” 
says Chang. “You must have other anchors of improvement in the 
KPIs, such as creating a better customer experience.”

Organizations are raising the bar on data maturity
According to the group of high performers in our research, frequent data-centric evaluation is one  
of the two effective tactics for achieving quick wins from tech investments. And the wins from  
data-centric approaches are stacking up. Organizations that are in the top two data maturity 
categories across the factors measured are more likely to be satisfied with the value generated 
across all their tech investments. For example, these organizations are likely to achieve better 
service reliability, as they are 18 percentage points less likely to say that flaws in their foundational 
IT systems disrupt business as usual on a weekly basis.
The data management maturity of many organizations is now strengthening across the board, 
setting a new corporate benchmark.

Optimizing value through evidence-based decisions
Value must be quantifiable and comparable
Once executives have identified the problem areas that require 
support from tech, they need to deliver and measure value. 
For the executives in our research, the three most popular ways of 
measuring value are: 
In general, data maturity has increased, with over half of respondents 
(52 percent on average) now at one of the two highest levels of data 
proficiency — the influential/embedded stages, up from 40 percent  
in 2023. 
Cloud platforms play a key role in enhancing proficiency in this area. 
Better data management and integration is the most commonly 
identified gain from increased use of XaaS tech.
Organizations can do much more with customer 
feedback
According to our execs, directing tech investments towards the 
service pain points flagged by customers and employees is the 
most influential tactic for generating quick wins from IT investments. 
For instance, process points that have multiple handoffs between 
stakeholders and multiple systems of record, with complex contracts 
can often be riddled with human-error related execution issues 
resulting in delays for customers. As an example, using data mining 
to identify opportunities to employ smart contracts, supported by 
blockchain or tokenization, can target these pain points to speed 
up processing times and reduce the need for intervention from 
intermediaries, while ensuring strong transparency and security levels.
“Look at your major business processes and ask: Where are 
inefficiencies dragging you down and keeping your organization from 
achieving its purpose?” says Microsoft’s Chang. “These are the 
points where technology is likely to be uniquely helpful.” 
However, customer insights tend to be wasted: 78 percent of 
execs say their business fails to use customer feedback effectively. 
Perhaps this is because organizations are struggling to decide on 
the required action to address the user feedback, or there may be 
communication issues between front and back office. Ultimately, 
unless organizations get better at using customer insights, tech 
execs risk wasting their investments on low-value areas.
Business growth metrics, 
such as number of new 
products launched
Financial metrics, such 
as cost-to-serve and 
profitability
Customer-centric metrics, 
such as customer satisfaction 
and customer base growth
78%
of execs say their business 
fails to use customer feedback 
effectively.

Optimizing value through evidence-based decisions
What do the high performers do?
Which behaviors set leading organizations apart when it comes to defining and delivering value? Our research suggests they are more 
likely to:
Developing data-backed measurements tailored to the business 
helps organizations establish cause and effect when they choose 
and implement tech. Predictive modeling capabilities, when used 
alongside these metrics, can advance the value creation journey by 
enabling proactive decision-making, forecasting demand and internal 
performance changes, identifying growth and cost optimization 
opportunities, and mitigating potential risks. 
Metrics forecasts are a helpful reference point for tracking 
investment performance, enabling informed course correction 
where required. For instance, 73 percent of execs say they perform 
accurate cost forecasts in their digital transformation projects. It 
also follows that the majority (67 percent) manage to prevent hidden 
costs from disrupting their digital transformation journeys. 
But our leading organizations go further. Compared with other 
organizations, the top performers are more likely to use both 
qualitative and quantitative metrics to establish causal trends, and 
are more likely to use real-time data to guide decision-making. 
By continuously monitoring performance, organizations spot where 
to adjust in response to internal and external influences. As such, 
the high performers in the research are 10 percentage points more 
likely than the mainstream group to regularly review and update their 
value-tracking metrics to stay aligned with market changes. 
Make value-driven decisions aligned with their long-term goals: 
Leaders are dedicated to ensuring their daily decisions contribute to long-term strategic goals and organizational 
definitions of success. Over half (53 percent) of leading organizations strategically evaluate their tech investment 
portfolio to ensure it aligns with their long-term goals, 12 percentage points higher than non-leaders.
Get everyone on the same page: 
Despite the challenge of managing a growing number of priorities and stakeholders, high performers achieve speed 
to action by ensuring they have strong alignment across the organization. For instance, 90 percent of leaders can 
efficiently achieve consensus between stakeholders, whereas other organizations are 18 percentage points less likely 
to be able to do so.
Adopt an “always-on” approach to performance management: 
Leading organizations continually develop the quality and breadth of the inputs that are informing their decisions. 
For instance, leaders are more likely to regularly review and update their value-tracking metrics as the market changes 
and use qualitative and quantitative insights to assess their digital transformation plans.
Master the balance between acting as a risk guardian and a transformation accelerator: 
Leading organizations rank risk and cybersecurity metrics as most important for evaluating tech investments; 
87 percent are confident in their ability to measure this type of value (compared with just 66 percent of other 
organizations). Also these leaders are 21 percentage points more likely to ensure their portfolio of tech investments 
are balanced from a risk perspective.

Data both drives and sustains digital transformation. 
Data maturity, security, and governance enable the pace of 
innovation, and can help improve customer experiences. 
Insufficiently secure solutions create the risk of data 
breaches, inefficiencies, or missed opportunities, which 
can erode business value and customer trust. Data security 
and governance form a robust transformation delivery 
infrastructure that underpins an organization’s strategic 
ability to differentiate, maintain cost effectiveness and 
manage risk in the digital era.

Data proficiency should be a core 
competency for the organization
While organizations are investing in data accessibility, 
research indicates that only 24 percent are focusing 
on nurturing a data-centric culture and ensuring data 
interoperability in the near term. This oversight presents a 
substantial barrier to fully harnessing technology’s potential 
and undermines the ability to effectively use and understand 
data across all levels of the organization. 
In a landscape increasingly dominated by data, it’s crucial 
that organizations break down these silos and cultivate 
a deep, enterprise-wide appreciation of data strategy. 
By doing so, they can accelerate digital transformation 
towards success by optimizing processes, and dynamically 
enhancing their products and services to meet customers’ 
evolving needs.
For sustainable innovation, execs need 
to prioritize trust and security
Execs must ensure that pace of innovation is sustainable, 
secure and that they can communicate value to 
stakeholders. The high performers in our research rate risk 
and cybersecurity metrics, including reduced frequency of 
cybersecurity incidents, improved compliance and lower 
failure rates, as the most important lenses through which to 
evaluate tech. They are also more likely to be confident that 
they can track their performance in these areas. 
This security-led stance of the leader group underlines the wider 
importance of trust, and how to pursue it. Overall, for the executives 
surveyed, cybersecurity and privacy are the biggest concerns for 
achieving a successful digital transformation. They also maintain that 
the top skill organizations need to thrive in a digital economy is the 
ability to ensure such considerations are front and center of business 
and tech priorities of the organization. 72 percent of organizations are 
embracing a secure-by-design mindset by involving and empowering 
cybersecurity teams in the early stages of tech investment projects. 
In fact, cybersecurity and privacy can enable organizations to pursue 
their business objectives securely and confidently, and embrace new 
opportunities. Organizations need to learn from our high performers 
group and do more to evaluate tech investments against risk and 
cybersecurity factors. For this to be comprehensive, cybersecurity 
experts need a seat at the table from the outset so they can advise 
on how security can be embedded to build resilience and trust. 
In doing so, cybersecurity and privacy can support the organization, 
as a trust enhancer and protector of brand reputation, by minimizing 
the need for costly retrofitting of security fixes and the risk of data 
breaches.
For many organizations, there is a disconnect between intentions 
and reality regarding the security-related habits of their workforces. 
Almost 8 in 10 (78 percent) respondents overall say that their staff 
training treats cybersecurity as a box-ticking exercise and it is not 
embedded as required.
Rather than rely exclusively on formal training sessions, 
organizations should focus on implementing controls and 
operational features that make cybersecurity easy for employees 
to embrace in their daily work. For instance, strategies such as 
automating DevSecOps processes or providing access to password 
manager platforms can promote more secure employee behaviors. 
Michael Wagner, CISO at Kenvue, agrees that cybersecurity and 
resilience must be at the forefront of daily tech usage. This includes 
maintaining business continuity plans, having a retainer with an 
incident response firm, testing backups and conducting regular 
recovery exercises. 
“Incident exercises, where different scenarios are presented, are 
vital so that we can be prepared should the worst occur,” says 
Wagner. “For instance, the CrowdStrike patch update issue [in 
July 2024] caused widespread IT outages around the globe.”
The wider picture here is that tech innovation is not the enemy 
of risk management — rather, they should reinforce each other. 
By starting with a clear definition of success that is rooted in  
their organization’s purpose, tech execs will be able to direct  
tech initiatives towards areas that will bring meaningful value. 
An insight-led approach will enable execs to prioritize and make 
decisions when it comes to delivering value.
Polly Sumner 
Chief Adoption Officer, Salesforce
When data is embedded and people are 
empowered, tools like AI are adopted very 
quickly and this creates value super-fast. 
Start with automation and free up people 
to do what they do best, more quickly and 
in more interesting ways.

Tie investment to value: 
Leaders consider it a top two priority to ensure data system 
investments align with the priorities of key business stakeholders, 
whereas other organizations place this outside of their top three  
focus areas. 
Perform routine data-hygiene audits: 
Eighty percent of leaders conduct routine data hygiene audits to 
address gaps in data integrity and create data ownership frameworks. 
Other organizations are 31 percentage points less likely to have this as 
a fundamental part of their strategies.
Use data and internal knowledge sharing to respond to 
market risks: 
Leaders say data-centric decision-making (61 percent) and internal 
knowledge sharing (48 percent) enable them to adjust their digital 
transformation strategies in response to evolving market risks 
(compared with 43 and 38 percent, respectively, of non-leaders). 
While data insights can sharpen risk resilience, internal knowledge 
sharing is crucial. By educating employees and keeping them informed 
of developments, organizations will empower them to adapt and 
contribute to positive change.
Prioritize data security:  
Leaders are 9 percentage points more likely than non-leaders to 
cite security as a key area of focus for improvement over the next 
12 months.
What do the high performers do?
How are the high-performing organizations strengthening their data backbones and 
using data as an asset to deliver secure digital transformation outcomes? Our research 
suggests these organizations are more likely to:
Involve security 
teams from the 
outset: 
Executives maintain 
that cybersecurity 
and privacy are the 
biggest concerns for achieving a 
successful digital transformation 
but, when it comes to security, 
moving at a measured pace is 
important. Involving cybersecurity 
and information governance 
teams from the outset of 
digital transformation initiatives 
will help minimize delays and 
enable businesses to progress 
investments confidently. To reduce 
security-related downtime, battle 
test your organization’s threat 
response reflexes. Kenvue’s Wagner 
suggests that business continuity 
plans, having a retainer with an 
incident response firm, backups 
testing and regular recovery 
exercises will prove vital here.
Challenge risk 
aversion by 
articulating the 
costs of inaction: 
A high 80 percent 
of executives say 
that a risk averse attitude leads 
senior leadership to respond to 
market forces more slowly than 
competitors. When faced with 
a scenario where risk aversion 
is influencing senior leadership 
towards gridlock, one helpful 
tactic to kick-start movement is to 
evaluate the risks of inaction against 
the change being considered. For 
instance, losing market share to 
competitors because of a failure 
to adapt your product offering. If 
analysis reveals that the threats 
associated with staying idle are 
too concerning to ignore, this can 
stimulate forward momentum and 
creative thinking to tackle challenges 
and manage the risks that come 
with embracing the change.
Accelerate 
progress by 
removing 
governance 
bottlenecks: 
Poor governance 
and coordination appear in the 
top three toughest challenges 
that derail transformation 
progress. For instance, 
58 percent say their centralized 
decision-making reduces their 
organization’s ability to respond 
to market signals and embrace 
new tech, while 57 percent say 
that friction and communication 
breakdowns occur frequently 
between teams at times of 
high workload.

Scaling AI with confidence
Applying AI as an organization can 
unlock a lot of excitement for your 
workforce because it can really boost 
employee wellbeing.
AI can take the pain out of longstanding 
problems that have previously sapped 
time and energy from employees and, 
in turn, enhance job satisfaction. 
Michelle Chang 
CFO/CVP, Microsoft Customer and Partner Solutions
1 https://kpmg.com/xx/en/home/services/kpmg-trusted-ai.html
Almost three-quarters of organizations 
are already achieving business value 
from their AI investments, but only 
one in three has been able to achieve 
this at scale.
Enthusiasm is being fueled by 
democratized experimentation 
approaches, but as use cases scale up 
many predict a tipping point marking a 
drive towards greater centralization. 
The AI ‘black-box’ is causing workforce anxiety
It is positive that 74 percent of respondents say AI is already 
increasing the productivity of their knowledge workers, improving 
their organization’s overall performance. Furthermore, just over 
8 in 10 respondents expect automation efforts to shift the focus of 
knowledge workers towards more creative roles, and that AI will 
even redefine the future of knowledge itself. 
However, AI is also fueling anxiety in the workforce. Consensus 
and trust will be the keys to progress. More than three-quarters 
of organizations (78 percent) are concerned that many users see 
AI as a ‘black box’. Almost as many (77 percent) expect AI to pose 
challenges to their current operational structures, potentially leading 
to job reduction and ethical concerns. 
Managing employee anxiety around change will be critical to AI 
adoption at speed. Those who navigate the evolving tech landscape 
with a focus on employee empowerment, and bringing everyone on 
board, will flourish amid rapid change. Organizations believe their 
workforce has an appetite for cutting-edge tech. But there is also 
fear that some individuals feel left behind by the rapidly evolving 
tech landscape. 
In an era where AI’s rapid evolution and adoption are reshaping the 
competitive landscape, tech execs need to rethink their strategic 
leadership roles. Three-quarters (76 percent) of tech execs surveyed 
feel that their role has evolved significantly over the past two 
years as the nature of tech and the workforce itself is changing. 
Tech execs must manage board level expectations during a period 
of hype cycles and cost sensitivity. At the same time, they must 
balance this against the need for a stable, coherent environment 
in which the workforce can harness AI, rather than stifling it. Tech 
execs play a critical role in steering their organizations through 
uncertain times, acting as a strategic innovator, adaptive pioneer, 
trend navigator and risk guardian. 
To find out more about the use cases for AI across the enterprise, visit our website.
Importantly, there are ways to address such concerns. KPMG’s 
Trusted AI1 framework, for example, emphasizes 10 pillars upon 
which to design, build, deploy and use AI solutions in an ethical 
manner. They include priorities such as fairness, sustainability, 
privacy, security and accountability.

of respondents say AI 
is already increasing 
the productivity of 
their knowledge 
workers, improving 
their organization’s 
overall performance.
Most organizations are now seeing some return on 
AI, but value at scale remains more elusive 
AI adoption is gathering speed, and so is the rate of return (three out 
of four organizations this year are already generating value from AI). 
However, only 31 percent of all organizations achieve this at scale.
Given the expanding range of potential use cases for AI, it’s essential 
to establish a strategy aligned with business goals, adopt a portfolio 
approach to explore a range of opportunities simultaneously, make 
trade-off decisions led by proven value, and employ an iterative 
process for consistent monitoring and enhancement.

Which of the following best describe how your company is 
experimenting with potential AI use cases?
Rather than a stringent centralized approach, organizations are 
adopting a more inclusive mindset around AI experimentation, 
crowdsourcing use cases from their workforces. The most popular 
approach is open collaboration, where diverse working groups 
conduct controlled experiments, sometimes supported by AI centers 
of excellence (CoEs) with representatives from every department. 
This approach is prioritized by organizations at the most mature level 
of AI implementation. Only 6 percent of organizations subscribe to 
a top-down approach to AI experimentation with heavy constraints 
around AI use from the outset. 
While initially encouraging democratized experimentation, many 
respondents (40 percent) plan a shift to a more centralized approach 
once they reach a critical mass of ideas that require stricter 
management to control risk and reduce duplication. In doing so, 
organizations should apply a balanced approach and steer away from 
overly stringent approval processes to avoid stifling innovation. One 
way of balancing speed with risk is driving alignment through cross-
functional CoEs or user groups, and only centrally managing AI 
initiatives that those groups identify as high-risk or high complexity. 
Regardless of their chosen experimentation approach, organizations 
have the opportunity to consolidate underlying processing and data 
infrastructure leading to gains in efficiency, reduced technical debt 
and a more effective end solution.
A systematic approach is key to prioritizing AI 
investment in alignment with business goals
To ensure the use cases with the greatest potential receive the 
attention and cross-functional support they require, there must be a 
strong roadmap to scaling and a clear link to business value. Many 
organizations are chasing short-term value by implementing AI tools 
in discrete parts of the value chain — that is, identifying specific use 
cases for deployment — where they see potential to solve problems 
or drive value. This is an understandable approach, but they must be 
careful not to create a tangle of initiatives that become increasingly 
difficult to track and compare.
Tracking expenditure and return on poorly integrated initiatives is even 
more pressing, given organizations expect to increase investment in 
AI over the next 12 months. Their top short-term goals for AI over the 
next year are to drive increased operational efficiency via automation, 
improve product and service development and innovation, and 
enhance pattern detection and issue correction. 
Data outlining customer behavior and feedback can help organizations 
understand where to apply AI for maximum effect. Salesforce’s 
Sumner raises the example of insurance, where automating contact 
points with customers worked well until policyholders wanted to 
notify their insurer of a loss. “Insurers were never able to get more 
than 10 percent of customers to do that online. They realized people 
were looking for human empathy.” This example shows how truly 
listening to customers can guide to the right path for delivering real 
value, and it’s a reminder that AI should be a tool or collaborator for 
human workers, rather than a replacement. 
Organizations should move away from disjointed AI use cases, and 
adopt a portfolio approach towards AI, focus on maximizing ROI while 
balancing innovation with risk mitigation.
Success that outlasts the hype will require 
consensus across the enterprise
The biggest barrier facing many organizations is moving from 
experimentation to production, says Naveen Zutshi, from Databricks. 
In scaling up an AI use case from a PoC to a more widespread 
production-level organizational practice, “the bottleneck is the 
confidence in the reliability, quality and safety of those AI models,” 
Zutshi says. “That comes back to data quality. You need to understand 
how the data is flowing: do you have sovereignty rights over the data, 
are you doing the right masking and encryption, and how are you 
looking at access controls right down to row and column level?”

Generative AI is introducing a brand-new risk vector to the tech 
domain, such as ‘hallucinations’, ‘jailbreaks’ and ‘adversarial 
prompting’ that can manipulate AI. The unexpected consequences 
of generated content have appeared seemingly frequently in 
the news this year. In light of this, when scaling emerging tech, 
organizations will need to have the governance and processes in 
place to control emerging risks. Survey respondents highlight the 
importance of continually developing AI governance policies for 
ethical and fair use in line with the evolving regulatory landscape. 
The process of establishing trusted guardrails and controls requires 
a multi-lens end-to-end secure approach to designing, building and 
deployment that incorporates coding best practice, code reviews, 
staff training and red teaming exercises that test the performance 
and reliability of AI models.
The ongoing AI hype may tempt organizations to make hurried 
decisions. However, successful AI adoption requires an enterprise-
wide multidisciplinary effort and a clear alignment across the 
enterprise, and a shared understanding of AI’s role and its potential. 
Organizations that can clearly define and communicate the value of AI 
to all stakeholders within the context of their business objectives, and 
execute through thoughtful collaboration, will have a greater chance of 
maximizing its impact across the enterprise.
As organizations embark on their AI transformation journeys, tech execs are at the forefront of navigating this complex and evolving 
landscape. In order to go beyond the hype and harness the potential of AI while balancing speed, risk, and value, they should focus on 
five key areas: 
Delivering value from AI: 
By aligning AI initiatives with overall business strategy, setting expectations for ROI, and allocating budget to AI transformation.
Unlocking AI capability: 
By upskilling teams to work with AI, setting up organizational governance structures, and identifying capabilities required 
across the business.
Building trust in AI: 
By identifying and addressing risks associated with AI, ensuring data quality and integrity, managing shadow AI and securing 
sensitive data used in AI.
Scaling AI with confidence: 
By deciding whether to build or buy AI capabilities, identifying suitable partners and vendors, and focusing on interoperability 
with existing IT infrastructure.
Architecting AI transformation: 
By engaging with the business and its various leaders to plan AI rollouts by value stream, function, or product, establishing an 
adoption roadmap, and integrating AI into existing business, digital, and tech strategies.

Scaling AI with confidence
Foreword
Conclusion and key recommendations
While the pace of digital transformation can 
be daunting, our research shows that many 
organizations are taking considerable strides 
forward in their implementation journeys, 
especially with AI, XaaS and cybersecurity.
The additional profitability that transformation has yielded so far is certainly 
encouraging and organizations are seeking value beyond profits. Execs are 
calibrating their digital transformation formulas to supercharge progress 
across a range of strategic objectives, including ESG responsibilities and 
customer experience elevation.
This year’s findings reveal that primary evidence, such as PoC tests and ROI, 
is taking precedence over a herd mentality. This empirical ethos will be integral 
to securing value and making wise choices, especially as tech execs try to 
balance the maintenance of legacy systems with a focus on new technology. 
To help guard against stakeholder skepticism associated with the safety and 
viability of new digital transformation opportunities, organizations should also 
bring structure, discipline and an enterprise mindset to the adoption of new 
technology, to mitigate risks and optimize value realization. 
The tech execs who make the superior decisions, safely steering their 
organization through various headwinds and risks, will be those that stay 
firmly rooted in a data-centric and value-led approach. These transformers 
will draw on both real-time and predictive data insights from a broad range 
of sources to make balanced judgment calls that align to the broader 
business and tech strategies, to drive sustainable value. 
Organizations that consistently 
demonstrate these behaviors 
can outpace their competition 
and unlock the potential of 
their technology investments, 
securing and growing market 
share as they do so.

Scaling AI with confidence
Foreword
Conclusion and key recommendations
Our respondents demonstrate that AI is already living up to the hype, with the majority of executives confirming they have already achieved business value from AI systems. To maintain momentum, organizations 
should reinforce their data management foundations. As AI PoC experiments are scaled up to production level, data integrity and reliability among other criteria, will dictate whether these innovations result in 
breakthroughs or costly setbacks. 
The attitudes and behaviors of high-performing organizations in this report provide many clues as to how to secure value from tech innovation.
Harness the 
power of 
partnership 
Resist being 
hypnotized by 
FOMO 
While a desire to 
progress and outpace 
your competition is 
healthy, do not let this 
boil over and distort your 
judgment. Rather than 
blindly following the herd, 
anchor decisions in your 
organization’s strategic 
objectives and look for 
tangible primary evidence 
of the right path to take.
Be empirical about 
deﬁning and 
delivering value 
Align stakeholders around a 
clear deﬁnition of success 
that cascades into a set of 
tangible metrics. Adopt an 
“always-on” approach to 
performance management 
and continuously monitor and 
adjust metrics in accordance 
with internal and external 
changes. These steps will help 
the organization to conﬁdently 
make decisions and deliver 
the value promised.
Mitigate 
technical debt
Embrace structured 
technical debt 
management. Establish 
clear remediation plans 
and robust architecture 
principles to contain and 
rationalize the technology 
landscape.
Innovation is not 
restricted to new 
technology. Explore new 
ways to collaborate, 
co-invest and share 
risk with your chosen 
partners. Use their 
networks to gain access 
to the latest technology 
and inventive ideas from 
around the globe.
Prioritize trust 
and security 
Ensure solutions are 
secure by design and 
embed trust and security 
assurance from the 
outset. Design, build, 
deploy and use AI and 
emerging tech solutions 
in a responsible and 
ethical manner so 
your organization can 
accelerate value with 
conﬁdence.
Build a strong 
data backbone 
Establish a robust data 
management framework 
that combines data, people, 
processes and policies 
to ensure information 
is reliable, relevant and 
appropriately used. Drive 
a shared understanding 
across the organization 
of how to harness data 
more effectively to support 
rapid and informed 
decision-making.
Develop AI 
proﬁciencies through
knowledge sharing
Test your workforce 
competence and 
sentiment on AI, and 
use this to determine 
the best way to bridge 
knowledge gaps, 
facilitate continuous 
learning and encourage 
cross-functional 
collaboration.

years research is the perception among tech executives that they are struggling to keep up with the pace of change in response to this sense of falling behind organizations may be tempted to make a hurried response however this can lead to misguided investments that may prove both risky and expensive potentially increasing the burden of technical debt which many wellestablished organizations are already struggling with our research suggests that organizations are increasingly aware of this dilemma and they are looking to pivot from imitating others to becoming leaders themselves typically technology leaders are paving the way by bringing structure discipline and an enterprise mindset to the adoption of new technology in doing so they are looking to evidencebased investment decisions that align to the broader business and technology strategies and balance value creation with appetite for risk overall the sense from our respondents is that organizations are doing well with measurable improvement in many areas over the past year mistakes provide great learning opportunities for the future and the positive perspective on progress shared by our survey participants is encouraging 2450 technology professionals worldwide from a variety of industries the relentless speed of technology innovation is undeniable when combined with a natural fear of missing out ideas that may once have seemed like science fiction are rapidly converting into tangible reality from generative ai to quantum computing the potential benefits are huge and so is the risk of making costly mistakes by taking a measured approach to technology investment executives are already benefiting from key advancements while keeping a firm hold on their business models and successfully running the

organizations are struggling to keep up with the pace of change planning for the long term can be difficult when balancing the needs of the latest technological advancements to maximize progress tech execs should channel digital transformation efforts towards what matters most strategically to their organizations where weve seen organizations achieving the most value from tech is where they step away from the habit of just following a tech trend for the sake of it says michelle chang cfocvp of microsoft customer and partner solutions and instead start with what is our business trying to

half of respondents 52 percent on average now at one of the two highest levels of data proficiency the influentialembedded stages up from 40 percent in 2023 cloud platforms play a key role in enhancing proficiency in this area better data management and integration is the most commonly identified gain from increased use of xaas tech organizations can do much more with customer feedback according to our execs directing tech investments towards the service pain points flagged by customers and employees is the most influential tactic for generating quick wins from it investments for instance process points that have multiple handoffs between stakeholders and multiple systems of record with complex contracts can often be riddled with humanerror related execution issues resulting in delays for customers as an example using data mining to identify opportunities to employ smart contracts supported by blockchain or tokenization can target these pain points to speed up processing times and reduce the need for intervention from intermediaries while ensuring strong transparency and security levels look at your major business processes and ask where are inefficiencies dragging you down and keeping your organization from achieving its purpose says microsofts chang these are the points where technology is likely to be uniquely helpful however customer insights tend to be wasted 78 percent of execs say their business fails to use customer feedback effectively perhaps this is because organizations are struggling to decide on the required action to address the user feedback or there may be communication issues between front and back office ultimately unless organizations get better at using customer insights tech execs risk wasting their investments on lowvalue

capabilities when used alongside these metrics can advance the value creation journey by enabling proactive decisionmaking forecasting demand and internal performance changes identifying growth and cost optimization opportunities and mitigating potential risks metrics forecasts are a helpful reference point for tracking investment performance enabling informed course correction where required for instance 73 percent of execs say they perform accurate cost forecasts in their digital transformation projects it also follows that the majority 67 percent manage to prevent hidden costs from disrupting their digital transformation journeys but our leading organizations go further compared with other organizations the top performers are more likely to use both qualitative and quantitative metrics to establish causal trends and are more likely to use realtime data to guide decisionmaking by continuously monitoring performance organizations spot where to adjust in response to internal

delivering resilient solutions data proficiency should be a core competency for the organization while organizations are investing in data accessibility research indicates that only 24 percent are focusing on nurturing a datacentric culture and ensuring data interoperability in the near term this oversight presents a substantial barrier to fully harnessing technologys potential and undermines the ability to effectively use and understand data across all levels of the organization in a landscape increasingly dominated by data its crucial that organizations break down these silos and cultivate a deep enterprisewide appreciation of data strategy by doing so they can accelerate digital transformation towards success by optimizing processes and dynamically enhancing their products and services to meet customers evolving needs for sustainable innovation execs need to prioritize trust and security execs must ensure that pace of innovation is sustainable secure and that they can communicate value to stakeholders the high performers in our research rate risk and cybersecurity metrics including reduced frequency of cybersecurity incidents improved compliance and lower failure rates as the most important lenses through which to evaluate tech they are also more likely to be confident that they can track their performance in these areas this securityled stance of the leader group underlines the wider importance of trust and how to pursue it overall for the executives surveyed cybersecurity and privacy are the biggest concerns for achieving a successful digital transformation they also maintain that the top skill organizations need to thrive in a digital economy is the ability to ensure such considerations are front and center of business and tech priorities of the organization 72 percent of organizations are embracing a securebydesign mindset by involving and empowering cybersecurity teams in the early stages of tech investment projects in fact cybersecurity and privacy can enable organizations to pursue their business objectives securely and confidently and embrace new opportunities organizations need to learn from our high performers group and do more to evaluate tech investments against risk and cybersecurity factors for this to be comprehensive cybersecurity experts need a seat at the table from the outset so they can advise on how security can be embedded to build resilience and trust in doing so cybersecurity and privacy can support the organization as a trust enhancer and protector of brand reputation by minimizing the need for costly retrofitting of security fixes and the risk of data breaches for many organizations there is a disconnect between intentions and reality regarding the securityrelated habits of their workforces almost 8 in 10 78 percent respondents overall say that their staff training treats cybersecurity as a boxticking exercise and it is not embedded as required rather than rely exclusively on formal training sessions organizations should focus on implementing controls and operational features that make cybersecurity easy for employees to embrace in their daily work for instance strategies such as automating devsecops processes or providing access to password manager platforms can promote more secure employee behaviors michael wagner ciso at kenvue agrees that cybersecurity and resilience must be at the forefront of daily tech usage this includes maintaining business continuity plans having a retainer with an incident response firm testing backups and conducting regular recovery exercises incident exercises where different scenarios are presented are vital so that we can be prepared should the worst occur says wagner for instance the crowdstrike patch update issue in july 2024 caused widespread it outages around the globe the wider picture here is that tech innovation is not the enemy of risk management rather they should reinforce each other by starting with a

continuity plans having a retainer with an incident response firm backups testing and regular recovery exercises will prove vital here challenge risk aversion by articulating the costs of inaction a high 80 percent of executives say that a risk averse attitude leads senior leadership to respond to market forces more slowly than competitors when faced with a scenario where risk aversion is influencing senior leadership towards gridlock one helpful tactic to kickstart movement is to evaluate the risks of inaction against the change being considered for instance losing market share to competitors because of a failure to adapt your product offering if analysis reveals that the threats associated with staying idle are too concerning to ignore this can stimulate forward momentum and creative thinking to tackle challenges and manage the risks that come with embracing the change accelerate progress by removing governance bottlenecks poor governance and coordination appear in the top three toughest challenges that derail transformation progress for instance 58 percent say their centralized decisionmaking reduces their organizations ability to respond to market signals and

are prohibited from using ai for anything else we are not experimenting with ai yet 19 6 1 which of the following best describe how your company is experimenting with potential ai use cases rather than a stringent centralized approach organizations are adopting a more inclusive mindset around ai experimentation crowdsourcing use cases from their workforces the most popular approach is open collaboration where diverse working groups conduct controlled experiments sometimes supported by ai centers of excellence coes with representatives from every department this approach is prioritized by organizations at the most mature level of ai implementation only 6 percent of organizations subscribe to a topdown approach to ai experimentation with heavy constraints around ai use from the outset while initially encouraging democratized experimentation many respondents 40 percent plan a shift to a more centralized approach once they reach a critical mass of ideas that require stricter management to control risk and reduce duplication in doing so organizations should apply a balanced approach and steer away from overly stringent approval processes to avoid stifling innovation one way of balancing speed with risk is driving alignment through cross functional coes or user groups and only centrally managing ai initiatives that those groups identify as highrisk or high complexity regardless of their chosen experimentation approach organizations have the opportunity to consolidate underlying processing and data infrastructure leading to gains in efficiency reduced technical debt and a more effective end solution a systematic approach is key to prioritizing ai investment in alignment with business goals to ensure the use cases with the greatest potential receive the attention and crossfunctional support they require there must be a strong roadmap to scaling and a clear link to business value many organizations are chasing shortterm value by implementing ai tools in discrete parts of the value chain that is identifying specific use cases for deployment where they see potential to solve problems or drive value this is an understandable approach but they must be careful not to create a tangle of initiatives that become increasingly difficult to track and compare tracking expenditure and return on poorly integrated initiatives is even more pressing given organizations expect to increase investment in ai over the next 12 months their top shortterm goals for ai over the next year are to drive increased operational efficiency via automation improve product and service development and innovation and enhance pattern detection and issue correction data outlining customer behavior and feedback can help organizations understand where to apply ai for maximum effect salesforces sumner raises the example of insurance where automating contact points with customers worked well until policyholders wanted to notify their insurer of a loss insurers were never able to get more than 10 percent of customers to do that online they realized people were looking for human empathy this example shows how truly listening to customers can guide to the right path for delivering real value and its a reminder that ai should be a tool or collaborator for human workers rather than a replacement organizations should move away from disjointed ai use cases and adopt a portfolio approach towards ai focus on maximizing roi while balancing innovation with risk mitigation success that outlasts the hype will require consensus across the enterprise the biggest barrier facing many organizations is moving from experimentation to production says naveen zutshi from databricks in scaling up an ai use case from a poc to a more widespread productionlevel organizational practice the bottleneck is the confidence in the reliability quality and safety of those ai models zutshi says that comes back to data quality you need to understand how the data is

Foreword
A key theme from this year’s research is the perception among 
tech executives that they are struggling to keep up with the pace 
of change. In response to this sense of falling behind, organizations 
may be tempted to make a hurried response. However, this can lead 
to misguided investments that may prove both risky and expensive, 
potentially increasing the burden of technical debt which many 
well-established organizations are already struggling with.
Our research suggests that organizations are increasingly aware of 
this dilemma, and they are looking to pivot from imitating others to 
becoming leaders themselves. Typically, technology leaders are paving 
the way by bringing structure, discipline and an enterprise mindset to 
the adoption of new technology.
In doing so, they are looking to evidence-based investment decisions 
that align to the broader business and technology strategies and balance 
value creation with appetite for risk.
Overall, the sense from our respondents is that organizations are 
doing well with measurable improvement in many areas over the 
past year. Mistakes provide great learning opportunities for the 
future, and the positive perspective on progress shared by our 
survey participants is encouraging.
2,450
technology professionals worldwide 
from a variety of industries
The relentless speed of technology innovation is undeniable. When combined with a natural fear of missing out, 
ideas that may once have seemed like science fiction are rapidly converting into tangible reality. From generative AI 
to quantum computing, the potential benefits are huge, and so is the risk of making costly mistakes.
By taking a measured approach to technology investment, executives 
are already benefiting from key advancements while keeping a firm 
hold on their business models and successfully running the enterprise. 
A willingness to enter the realm of science fiction does not mean leaving 
the facts of sound business management behind.

Foreword
Identifying value amid the hype
To harness the full potential of the 
wave of new tech advancements, 
organizations must sustain a measured, 
strategic approach to investment.
Rapid change is driving fear of missing out (FOMO) 
Our research shows that the rapidly accelerated technology 
innovation over the past year has amplified a strong sense of FOMO 
among organizations. 
The flood of AI-related news entering the mainstream has stirred 
a collective interest in AI that transcends seniority and technical 
expertise. This has only served to stoke the fires of ‘tech-envy’ and 
could encourage a ‘spend now, ask questions later’ attitude.
Digital transformation can bring many exciting benefits, and 
ambition to progress is only healthy, but organizations must not let 
it distort their judgement. Progress paranoia could lead to misguided 
investments and disjointed implementation initiatives. 
Despite FOMO, organizations are taking a more 
balanced approach to investment decisions
While execs continue to look at the trends set by their market peers 
for guidance, this year sees more of them basing investment decisions 
on their own primary evidence. 
This year, executives are drawing on a wider range of sources to 
inform their investment decisions. All investment drivers measured in 
Tapping into the pace of change 
is something we are focused 
on and excited about, all in the 
context of doing so in a safe 
and secure way.

Information Officer, Commonwealth Bank of Australia
78%
worry that they 
are struggling 
to keep up with 
the pace of 
change
80%
complain that their senior 
leadership’s risk aversion 
means their organization is 
slower than competitors to 
embrace new technology
2023 have seen an increase in prevalence for 2024 by an average of 
15 percentage points. 
That said, the drivers have shifted in terms of which has the strongest 
influence on tech choices. While following competitors is still a top 
decision driver in 2024, it has fallen to third behind looking to third-party 
guidance (89 percent) and in-house trials and proof of concept (PoC; 
83 percent of the base). This may reflect the desire for organizations to 
overtake competitors in getting emerging tech to market.
Still, for many, FOMO remains a strong influence on investment 
decisions: 82 percent are still choosing tech investments such 
as virtual and augmented reality (VR and AR) in order to follow 
in their competitors’ footsteps. In comparison, the study’s digital 
transformation high performers are 22 percentage points more likely 
than other organizations to rely on customer feedback. And these 
leading organizations place following competitors outside of their top 
three motivations for investing in certain tech.

Compared to 2023, tech implementation maturity has improved across 
the board, with the biggest increases seen in data analytics and XaaS. 
In the 2023 tech report the most common implementation stage 
for XaaS was that companies had a strategic vision but were limited 
because of low buy-in or investment approvals. This year, the majority of 
organizations are proactive in progressing against their XaaS strategies. 
Priorities for further 
investment over the next 
year include XaaS, which 
86% 
chose, as organizations 
focus on the agility and cost 
reductions enabled by cloud 
computing.
Across all tech, ASPAC is the region that is most likely to be at the 
proactive implementation stage, with India and China leading the way. 
Priorities for further investment over the next year include XaaS, 
which 86 percent chose, as organizations focus on the agility and 
cost reductions enabled by cloud computing. Other priorities include 
cybersecurity (68 percent), AI/automation (65 percent) and edge 
computing (61 percent). These investment appetites indicate that 
many organizations put tech at the core of their business strategies.

Foreword
Identifying value amid the hype
What do the high performers do?
How are leading organizations advancing more quickly along their digital transformation 
journeys? Our research suggests these high performers are:
Neglecting legacy systems can compromise new 
tech investments
The desire to accelerate transformation appears to be favored: 
74 percent of organizations say that over the next 12 months, 
they plan to focus on investing in new tech rather than on 
enhancing the value of their existing tech suite. 
There is a risk that the allure of new technologies distracts 
organizations from addressing flaws and technical debt in 
their existing systems. This approach can, in turn, undermine 
transformation progress. 
Often, unresolved issues in current tech infrastructure can 
obstruct the implementation of emerging tech. 
In fact, unaddressed tech debt blocking the path to new 
upgrades is one of the top challenges holding back the digital 
transformation progress of the study’s digital transformation 
high performers. Further, 57 percent of organizations overall say 
that flaws in their foundational enterprise IT systems disrupt 
business-as-usual on a weekly basis. 
“The longer you delay addressing tech debt, the higher the costs 
and risks become,” says Commonwealth Bank of Australia’s 
Gavin Munroe. “Continuous investment is crucial. Accumulated 
tech debt often results in embedded business rules and logic, 
which can make future replacements costly and complex. So, 
it’s essential to consistently invest in unraveling tech debt to 
avoid escalating surprise costs and complexity over time.” 
Organizations must strike a healthy balance between new and 
existing tech investments. Executives’ intentions to prioritize 
XaaS investments will help here. By replacing outdated systems 
and consolidating multiple functions into centralized hubs, XaaS 
platforms can reduce the complexity of infrastructures and the 
volume of redundant tech.
Less likely to be gripped by FOMO:  
In comparison to non-leaders, our leader group is 23 percentage points 
less likely to worry about keeping up with the pace of change. Also, they 
are five percentage points less likely than the mainstream group to be 
choosing technologies because their competitors have already done so. 
Iteratively course-correcting: 
High-performing organizations are adopting a more proactive and 
adaptive approach to evaluating tech investments. As many as 83 percent 
of leaders continuously evaluate the business value and outcomes of all 
tech investments, which is 17 percentage points higher than non-leaders. 
This always-on approach will provide organizations with more opportunity 
to intervene and optimize where required.
Utilizing primary empirical evidence: 
Leaders are 21 percentage points more likely than non-leaders to run 
calculations to forecast the potential value of tech initiative before 
they invest. 
Leaning on external sources of expertise:  
To enhance their digital transformation decision-making, 93 percent of 
our leader group plan to expand and strengthen their ecosystem and 
partnerships, compared with 70 percent of the mainstream sample.
Aware of tech debt: 
In contrast with non-leaders, leading organizations place unaddressed 
tech debt as one of the top challenges holding back digital transformation 
progress. To avoid escalating surprise costs and complexity over time, 
organizations must consistently invest in unraveling tech debt.
57%
of organizations say that

Optimizing value through evidence-based decisions
When measuring the effectiveness of 
digital transformation or the adoption 
of a certain piece of tech, it’s 
important not to get fixated on just 
one metric. You have to think about 
the implications a metric may have 
on other metrics, and adjust your 
approach accordingly. 
Naveen Zutshi 
CIO, Databricks
On balance, organizations are content 
with the outcomes of their digital 
transformation investments, mostly 
thanks to their ability to make sound 
decisions along the journey. 
With the pace of change pressuring tech 
execs, organizations must ensure haste 
does not compromise the quality of 
their judgment calls.
Investing for the long term is still a good discipline 
to follow
With execs fearing that their organizations are struggling to keep 
up with the pace of change, planning for the long term can be 
difficult when balancing the needs of the latest technological 
advancements. To maximize progress, tech execs should channel 
digital transformation efforts towards what matters most strategically 
to their organizations. 
“Where we’ve seen organizations achieving the most value from 
tech is where they step away from the habit of just following a tech 
trend for the sake of it,” says Michelle Chang, CFO/CVP of Microsoft 
Customer and Partner Solutions. “And, instead, start with, ‘What 
is our business trying to accomplish, what’s our purpose and what 
problems are blocking us from achieving our purpose?’ The answers 
to these questions will indicate how tech can help them move 
forward in a meaningful way.” 
Our study’s top performers get this, with 53 percent strategically 
evaluating their tech investment portfolio to ensure it is aligned 
with their long-term goals (compared with 41 percent of other 
organizations). The good news is that most execs want to imbue 
their tech initiatives to provide value in non-tech areas; 70 percent 
ensure that their tech investments directly target their sustainability 
and social responsibilities. 
Executives understand that the value of tech goes beyond financial 
gain. “One of the lessons we’ve learnt is that tech initiatives cannot 
just be anchored in financial ROI — that’s not the only win available,” 
says Chang. “You must have other anchors of improvement in the 
KPIs, such as creating a better customer experience.”

53 percent are strategically
evaluating their tech investment 
portfolio to ensure it is aligned 
with their long-term goals 
(compared with 41 percent of 
other organizations). 
Most executives want their 
technology initiatives to have 
a broader sense of purpose: 
70 percent ensure that their 
tech investments directly target 
their sustainability and social 
responsibilities.
Organizations are raising the bar on data maturity
According to the group of high performers in our research, frequent data-centric evaluation is one  
of the two effective tactics for achieving quick wins from tech investments. And the wins from  
data-centric approaches are stacking up. Organizations that are in the top two data maturity 
categories across the factors measured are more likely to be satisfied with the value generated 
across all their tech investments. For example, these organizations are likely to achieve better 
service reliability, as they are 18 percentage points less likely to say that flaws in their foundational 
IT systems disrupt business as usual on a weekly basis.
The data management maturity of many organizations is now strengthening across the board, 
setting a new corporate benchmark.

Optimizing value through evidence-based decisions
Value must be quantifiable and comparable
Once executives have identified the problem areas that require 
support from tech, they need to deliver and measure value. 
For the executives in our research, the three most popular ways of 
measuring value are: 
In general, data maturity has increased, with over half of respondents 
(52 percent on average) now at one of the two highest levels of data 
proficiency — the influential/embedded stages, up from 40 percent  
in 2023. 
Cloud platforms play a key role in enhancing proficiency in this area. 
Better data management and integration is the most commonly 
identified gain from increased use of XaaS tech.
Organizations can do much more with customer 
feedback
According to our execs, directing tech investments towards the 
service pain points flagged by customers and employees is the 
most influential tactic for generating quick wins from IT investments. 
For instance, process points that have multiple handoffs between 
stakeholders and multiple systems of record, with complex contracts 
can often be riddled with human-error related execution issues 
resulting in delays for customers. As an example, using data mining 
to identify opportunities to employ smart contracts, supported by 
blockchain or tokenization, can target these pain points to speed 
up processing times and reduce the need for intervention from 
intermediaries, while ensuring strong transparency and security levels.
“Look at your major business processes and ask: Where are 
inefficiencies dragging you down and keeping your organization from 
achieving its purpose?” says Microsoft’s Chang. “These are the 
points where technology is likely to be uniquely helpful.” 
However, customer insights tend to be wasted: 78 percent of 
execs say their business fails to use customer feedback effectively. 
Perhaps this is because organizations are struggling to decide on 
the required action to address the user feedback, or there may be 
communication issues between front and back office. Ultimately, 
unless organizations get better at using customer insights, tech 
execs risk wasting their investments on low-value areas.
Business growth metrics, 
such as number of new 
products launched
Financial metrics, such 
as cost-to-serve and 
profitability
Customer-centric metrics, 
such as customer satisfaction 
and customer base growth
78%
of execs say their business 
fails to use customer feedback 
effectively.

Optimizing value through evidence-based decisions
What do the high performers do?
Which behaviors set leading organizations apart when it comes to defining and delivering value? Our research suggests they are more 
likely to:
Developing data-backed measurements tailored to the business 
helps organizations establish cause and effect when they choose 
and implement tech. Predictive modeling capabilities, when used 
alongside these metrics, can advance the value creation journey by 
enabling proactive decision-making, forecasting demand and internal 
performance changes, identifying growth and cost optimization 
opportunities, and mitigating potential risks. 
Metrics forecasts are a helpful reference point for tracking 
investment performance, enabling informed course correction 
where required. For instance, 73 percent of execs say they perform 
accurate cost forecasts in their digital transformation projects. It 
also follows that the majority (67 percent) manage to prevent hidden 
costs from disrupting their digital transformation journeys. 
But our leading organizations go further. Compared with other 
organizations, the top performers are more likely to use both 
qualitative and quantitative metrics to establish causal trends, and 
are more likely to use real-time data to guide decision-making. 
By continuously monitoring performance, organizations spot where 
to adjust in response to internal and external influences. As such, 
the high performers in the research are 10 percentage points more 
likely than the mainstream group to regularly review and update their 
value-tracking metrics to stay aligned with market changes. 
Make value-driven decisions aligned with their long-term goals: 
Leaders are dedicated to ensuring their daily decisions contribute to long-term strategic goals and organizational 
definitions of success. Over half (53 percent) of leading organizations strategically evaluate their tech investment 
portfolio to ensure it aligns with their long-term goals, 12 percentage points higher than non-leaders.
Get everyone on the same page: 
Despite the challenge of managing a growing number of priorities and stakeholders, high performers achieve speed 
to action by ensuring they have strong alignment across the organization. For instance, 90 percent of leaders can 
efficiently achieve consensus between stakeholders, whereas other organizations are 18 percentage points less likely 
to be able to do so.
Adopt an “always-on” approach to performance management: 
Leading organizations continually develop the quality and breadth of the inputs that are informing their decisions. 
For instance, leaders are more likely to regularly review and update their value-tracking metrics as the market changes 
and use qualitative and quantitative insights to assess their digital transformation plans.
Master the balance between acting as a risk guardian and a transformation accelerator: 
Leading organizations rank risk and cybersecurity metrics as most important for evaluating tech investments; 
87 percent are confident in their ability to measure this type of value (compared with just 66 percent of other 
organizations). Also these leaders are 21 percentage points more likely to ensure their portfolio of tech investments 
are balanced from a risk perspective.

Data both drives and sustains digital transformation. 
Data maturity, security, and governance enable the pace of 
innovation, and can help improve customer experiences. 
Insufficiently secure solutions create the risk of data 
breaches, inefficiencies, or missed opportunities, which 
can erode business value and customer trust. Data security 
and governance form a robust transformation delivery 
infrastructure that underpins an organization’s strategic 
ability to differentiate, maintain cost effectiveness and 
manage risk in the digital era.

Delivering resilient solutions
Data proficiency should be a core 
competency for the organization
While organizations are investing in data accessibility, 
research indicates that only 24 percent are focusing 
on nurturing a data-centric culture and ensuring data 
interoperability in the near term. This oversight presents a 
substantial barrier to fully harnessing technology’s potential 
and undermines the ability to effectively use and understand 
data across all levels of the organization. 
In a landscape increasingly dominated by data, it’s crucial 
that organizations break down these silos and cultivate 
a deep, enterprise-wide appreciation of data strategy. 
By doing so, they can accelerate digital transformation 
towards success by optimizing processes, and dynamically 
enhancing their products and services to meet customers’ 
evolving needs.
For sustainable innovation, execs need 
to prioritize trust and security
Execs must ensure that pace of innovation is sustainable, 
secure and that they can communicate value to 
stakeholders. The high performers in our research rate risk 
and cybersecurity metrics, including reduced frequency of 
cybersecurity incidents, improved compliance and lower 
failure rates, as the most important lenses through which to 
evaluate tech. They are also more likely to be confident that 
they can track their performance in these areas. 
This security-led stance of the leader group underlines the wider 
importance of trust, and how to pursue it. Overall, for the executives 
surveyed, cybersecurity and privacy are the biggest concerns for 
achieving a successful digital transformation. They also maintain that 
the top skill organizations need to thrive in a digital economy is the 
ability to ensure such considerations are front and center of business 
and tech priorities of the organization. 72 percent of organizations are 
embracing a secure-by-design mindset by involving and empowering 
cybersecurity teams in the early stages of tech investment projects. 
In fact, cybersecurity and privacy can enable organizations to pursue 
their business objectives securely and confidently, and embrace new 
opportunities. Organizations need to learn from our high performers 
group and do more to evaluate tech investments against risk and 
cybersecurity factors. For this to be comprehensive, cybersecurity 
experts need a seat at the table from the outset so they can advise 
on how security can be embedded to build resilience and trust. 
In doing so, cybersecurity and privacy can support the organization, 
as a trust enhancer and protector of brand reputation, by minimizing 
the need for costly retrofitting of security fixes and the risk of data 
breaches.
For many organizations, there is a disconnect between intentions 
and reality regarding the security-related habits of their workforces. 
Almost 8 in 10 (78 percent) respondents overall say that their staff 
training treats cybersecurity as a box-ticking exercise and it is not 
embedded as required.
Rather than rely exclusively on formal training sessions, 
organizations should focus on implementing controls and 
operational features that make cybersecurity easy for employees 
to embrace in their daily work. For instance, strategies such as 
automating DevSecOps processes or providing access to password 
manager platforms can promote more secure employee behaviors. 
Michael Wagner, CISO at Kenvue, agrees that cybersecurity and 
resilience must be at the forefront of daily tech usage. This includes 
maintaining business continuity plans, having a retainer with an 
incident response firm, testing backups and conducting regular 
recovery exercises. 
“Incident exercises, where different scenarios are presented, are 
vital so that we can be prepared should the worst occur,” says 
Wagner. “For instance, the CrowdStrike patch update issue [in 
July 2024] caused widespread IT outages around the globe.”
The wider picture here is that tech innovation is not the enemy 
of risk management — rather, they should reinforce each other. 
By starting with a clear definition of success that is rooted in  
their organization’s purpose, tech execs will be able to direct  
tech initiatives towards areas that will bring meaningful value. 
An insight-led approach will enable execs to prioritize and make 
decisions when it comes to delivering value.
Polly Sumner 
Chief Adoption Officer, Salesforce
When data is embedded and people are 
empowered, tools like AI are adopted very 
quickly and this creates value super-fast. 
Start with automation and free up people 
to do what they do best, more quickly and 
in more interesting ways.

Tie investment to value: 
Leaders consider it a top two priority to ensure data system 
investments align with the priorities of key business stakeholders, 
whereas other organizations place this outside of their top three  
focus areas. 
Perform routine data-hygiene audits: 
Eighty percent of leaders conduct routine data hygiene audits to 
address gaps in data integrity and create data ownership frameworks. 
Other organizations are 31 percentage points less likely to have this as 
a fundamental part of their strategies.
Use data and internal knowledge sharing to respond to 
market risks: 
Leaders say data-centric decision-making (61 percent) and internal 
knowledge sharing (48 percent) enable them to adjust their digital 
transformation strategies in response to evolving market risks 
(compared with 43 and 38 percent, respectively, of non-leaders). 
While data insights can sharpen risk resilience, internal knowledge 
sharing is crucial. By educating employees and keeping them informed 
of developments, organizations will empower them to adapt and 
contribute to positive change.
Prioritize data security:  
Leaders are 9 percentage points more likely than non-leaders to 
cite security as a key area of focus for improvement over the next 
12 months.
What do the high performers do?
How are the high-performing organizations strengthening their data backbones and 
using data as an asset to deliver secure digital transformation outcomes? Our research 
suggests these organizations are more likely to:
Involve security 
teams from the 
outset: 
Executives maintain 
that cybersecurity 
and privacy are the 
biggest concerns for achieving a 
successful digital transformation 
but, when it comes to security, 
moving at a measured pace is 
important. Involving cybersecurity 
and information governance 
teams from the outset of 
digital transformation initiatives 
will help minimize delays and 
enable businesses to progress 
investments confidently. To reduce 
security-related downtime, battle 
test your organization’s threat 
response reflexes. Kenvue’s Wagner 
suggests that business continuity 
plans, having a retainer with an 
incident response firm, backups 
testing and regular recovery 
exercises will prove vital here.
Challenge risk 
aversion by 
articulating the 
costs of inaction: 
A high 80 percent 
of executives say 
that a risk averse attitude leads 
senior leadership to respond to 
market forces more slowly than 
competitors. When faced with 
a scenario where risk aversion 
is influencing senior leadership 
towards gridlock, one helpful 
tactic to kick-start movement is to 
evaluate the risks of inaction against 
the change being considered. For 
instance, losing market share to 
competitors because of a failure 
to adapt your product offering. If 
analysis reveals that the threats 
associated with staying idle are 
too concerning to ignore, this can 
stimulate forward momentum and 
creative thinking to tackle challenges 
and manage the risks that come 
with embracing the change.
Accelerate 
progress by 
removing 
governance 
bottlenecks: 
Poor governance 
and coordination appear in the 
top three toughest challenges 
that derail transformation 
progress. For instance, 
58 percent say their centralized 
decision-making reduces their 
organization’s ability to respond 
to market signals and embrace 
new tech, while 57 percent say 
that friction and communication 
breakdowns occur frequently 
between teams at times of 
high workload.

Scaling AI with confidence
Applying AI as an organization can 
unlock a lot of excitement for your 
workforce because it can really boost 
employee wellbeing.
AI can take the pain out of longstanding 
problems that have previously sapped 
time and energy from employees and, 
in turn, enhance job satisfaction. 
Michelle Chang 
CFO/CVP, Microsoft Customer and Partner Solutions
1 https://kpmg.com/xx/en/home/services/kpmg-trusted-ai.html
Almost three-quarters of organizations 
are already achieving business value 
from their AI investments, but only 
one in three has been able to achieve 
this at scale.
Enthusiasm is being fueled by 
democratized experimentation 
approaches, but as use cases scale up 
many predict a tipping point marking a 
drive towards greater centralization. 
The AI ‘black-box’ is causing workforce anxiety
It is positive that 74 percent of respondents say AI is already 
increasing the productivity of their knowledge workers, improving 
their organization’s overall performance. Furthermore, just over 
8 in 10 respondents expect automation efforts to shift the focus of 
knowledge workers towards more creative roles, and that AI will 
even redefine the future of knowledge itself. 
However, AI is also fueling anxiety in the workforce. Consensus 
and trust will be the keys to progress. More than three-quarters 
of organizations (78 percent) are concerned that many users see 
AI as a ‘black box’. Almost as many (77 percent) expect AI to pose 
challenges to their current operational structures, potentially leading 
to job reduction and ethical concerns. 
Managing employee anxiety around change will be critical to AI 
adoption at speed. Those who navigate the evolving tech landscape 
with a focus on employee empowerment, and bringing everyone on 
board, will flourish amid rapid change. Organizations believe their 
workforce has an appetite for cutting-edge tech. But there is also 
fear that some individuals feel left behind by the rapidly evolving 
tech landscape. 
In an era where AI’s rapid evolution and adoption are reshaping the 
competitive landscape, tech execs need to rethink their strategic 
leadership roles. Three-quarters (76 percent) of tech execs surveyed 
feel that their role has evolved significantly over the past two 
years as the nature of tech and the workforce itself is changing. 
Tech execs must manage board level expectations during a period 
of hype cycles and cost sensitivity. At the same time, they must 
balance this against the need for a stable, coherent environment 
in which the workforce can harness AI, rather than stifling it. Tech 
execs play a critical role in steering their organizations through 
uncertain times, acting as a strategic innovator, adaptive pioneer, 
trend navigator and risk guardian. 
To find out more about the use cases for AI across the enterprise, visit our website.
Importantly, there are ways to address such concerns. KPMG’s 
Trusted AI1 framework, for example, emphasizes 10 pillars upon 
which to design, build, deploy and use AI solutions in an ethical 
manner. They include priorities such as fairness, sustainability, 
privacy, security and accountability.

Which of the following best describe how your company is 
experimenting with potential AI use cases?
Rather than a stringent centralized approach, organizations are 
adopting a more inclusive mindset around AI experimentation, 
crowdsourcing use cases from their workforces. The most popular 
approach is open collaboration, where diverse working groups 
conduct controlled experiments, sometimes supported by AI centers 
of excellence (CoEs) with representatives from every department. 
This approach is prioritized by organizations at the most mature level 
of AI implementation. Only 6 percent of organizations subscribe to 
a top-down approach to AI experimentation with heavy constraints 
around AI use from the outset. 
While initially encouraging democratized experimentation, many 
respondents (40 percent) plan a shift to a more centralized approach 
once they reach a critical mass of ideas that require stricter 
management to control risk and reduce duplication. In doing so, 
organizations should apply a balanced approach and steer away from 
overly stringent approval processes to avoid stifling innovation. One 
way of balancing speed with risk is driving alignment through cross-
functional CoEs or user groups, and only centrally managing AI 
initiatives that those groups identify as high-risk or high complexity. 
Regardless of their chosen experimentation approach, organizations 
have the opportunity to consolidate underlying processing and data 
infrastructure leading to gains in efficiency, reduced technical debt 
and a more effective end solution.
A systematic approach is key to prioritizing AI 
investment in alignment with business goals
To ensure the use cases with the greatest potential receive the 
attention and cross-functional support they require, there must be a 
strong roadmap to scaling and a clear link to business value. Many 
organizations are chasing short-term value by implementing AI tools 
in discrete parts of the value chain — that is, identifying specific use 
cases for deployment — where they see potential to solve problems 
or drive value. This is an understandable approach, but they must be 
careful not to create a tangle of initiatives that become increasingly 
difficult to track and compare.
Tracking expenditure and return on poorly integrated initiatives is even 
more pressing, given organizations expect to increase investment in 
AI over the next 12 months. Their top short-term goals for AI over the 
next year are to drive increased operational efficiency via automation, 
improve product and service development and innovation, and 
enhance pattern detection and issue correction. 
Data outlining customer behavior and feedback can help organizations 
understand where to apply AI for maximum effect. Salesforce’s 
Sumner raises the example of insurance, where automating contact 
points with customers worked well until policyholders wanted to 
notify their insurer of a loss. “Insurers were never able to get more 
than 10 percent of customers to do that online. They realized people 
were looking for human empathy.” This example shows how truly 
listening to customers can guide to the right path for delivering real 
value, and it’s a reminder that AI should be a tool or collaborator for 
human workers, rather than a replacement. 
Organizations should move away from disjointed AI use cases, and 
adopt a portfolio approach towards AI, focus on maximizing ROI while 
balancing innovation with risk mitigation.
Success that outlasts the hype will require 
consensus across the enterprise
The biggest barrier facing many organizations is moving from 
experimentation to production, says Naveen Zutshi, from Databricks. 
In scaling up an AI use case from a PoC to a more widespread 
production-level organizational practice, “the bottleneck is the 
confidence in the reliability, quality and safety of those AI models,” 
Zutshi says. “That comes back to data quality. You need to understand 
how the data is flowing: do you have sovereignty rights over the data, 
are you doing the right masking and encryption, and how are you 
looking at access controls right down to row and column level?”

Generative AI is introducing a brand-new risk vector to the tech 
domain, such as ‘hallucinations’, ‘jailbreaks’ and ‘adversarial 
prompting’ that can manipulate AI. The unexpected consequences 
of generated content have appeared seemingly frequently in 
the news this year. In light of this, when scaling emerging tech, 
organizations will need to have the governance and processes in 
place to control emerging risks. Survey respondents highlight the 
importance of continually developing AI governance policies for 
ethical and fair use in line with the evolving regulatory landscape. 
The process of establishing trusted guardrails and controls requires 
a multi-lens end-to-end secure approach to designing, building and 
deployment that incorporates coding best practice, code reviews, 
staff training and red teaming exercises that test the performance 
and reliability of AI models.
The ongoing AI hype may tempt organizations to make hurried 
decisions. However, successful AI adoption requires an enterprise-
wide multidisciplinary effort and a clear alignment across the 
enterprise, and a shared understanding of AI’s role and its potential. 
Organizations that can clearly define and communicate the value of AI 
to all stakeholders within the context of their business objectives, and 
execute through thoughtful collaboration, will have a greater chance of 
maximizing its impact across the enterprise.
As organizations embark on their AI transformation journeys, tech execs are at the forefront of navigating this complex and evolving 
landscape. In order to go beyond the hype and harness the potential of AI while balancing speed, risk, and value, they should focus on 
five key areas: 
Delivering value from AI: 
By aligning AI initiatives with overall business strategy, setting expectations for ROI, and allocating budget to AI transformation.
Unlocking AI capability: 
By upskilling teams to work with AI, setting up organizational governance structures, and identifying capabilities required 
across the business.
Building trust in AI: 
By identifying and addressing risks associated with AI, ensuring data quality and integrity, managing shadow AI and securing 
sensitive data used in AI.
Scaling AI with confidence: 
By deciding whether to build or buy AI capabilities, identifying suitable partners and vendors, and focusing on interoperability 
with existing IT infrastructure.
Architecting AI transformation: 
By engaging with the business and its various leaders to plan AI rollouts by value stream, function, or product, establishing an 
adoption roadmap, and integrating AI into existing business, digital, and tech strategies.

Foreword
Scaling AI with confidence
How are leading organizations extracting maximum value from their AI investments? 
Our research suggests they are more likely to:
What do the high performers do?
Use AI to analyze performance:
Ninety-three percent of leaders are using AI or 
predictive analytics to measure tech performance, 
which is 23 percentage points above the rest.
Address skill gaps with AI:
Eighty-nine percent of high-performing 
organizations say their business is using AI to fill 
skill gaps among knowledge workers, which is 
18 percentage points above other organizations.
Encourage their wider workforce to contribute  
to AI experiments:
Nearly half of all high-performing organizations (47 percent) have 
consolidated AI expertise and innovation through creating CoEs 
as the sources of their AI experimentation. These working groups 
feature employees from every department of the organization.

Optimizing value through evidence-based decisions
Delivering resilient solutions
Scaling AI with confidence
Foreword
Conclusion and key recommendations
While the pace of digital transformation can 
be daunting, our research shows that many 
organizations are taking considerable strides 
forward in their implementation journeys, 
especially with AI, XaaS and cybersecurity.
The additional profitability that transformation has yielded so far is certainly 
encouraging and organizations are seeking value beyond profits. Execs are 
calibrating their digital transformation formulas to supercharge progress 
across a range of strategic objectives, including ESG responsibilities and 
customer experience elevation.
This year’s findings reveal that primary evidence, such as PoC tests and ROI, 
is taking precedence over a herd mentality. This empirical ethos will be integral 
to securing value and making wise choices, especially as tech execs try to 
balance the maintenance of legacy systems with a focus on new technology. 
To help guard against stakeholder skepticism associated with the safety and 
viability of new digital transformation opportunities, organizations should also 
bring structure, discipline and an enterprise mindset to the adoption of new 
technology, to mitigate risks and optimize value realization. 
The tech execs who make the superior decisions, safely steering their 
organization through various headwinds and risks, will be those that stay 
firmly rooted in a data-centric and value-led approach. These transformers 
will draw on both real-time and predictive data insights from a broad range 
of sources to make balanced judgment calls that align to the broader 
business and tech strategies, to drive sustainable value. 
Organizations that consistently 
demonstrate these behaviors 
can outpace their competition 
and unlock the potential of 
their technology investments, 
securing and growing market 
share as they do so.

Scaling AI with confidence
Foreword
Conclusion and key recommendations
Our respondents demonstrate that AI is already living up to the hype, with the majority of executives confirming they have already achieved business value from AI systems. To maintain momentum, organizations 
should reinforce their data management foundations. As AI PoC experiments are scaled up to production level, data integrity and reliability among other criteria, will dictate whether these innovations result in 
breakthroughs or costly setbacks. 
The attitudes and behaviors of high-performing organizations in this report provide many clues as to how to secure value from tech innovation.
Harness the 
power of 
partnership 
Resist being 
hypnotized by 
FOMO 
While a desire to 
progress and outpace 
your competition is 
healthy, do not let this 
boil over and distort your 
judgment. Rather than 
blindly following the herd, 
anchor decisions in your 
organization’s strategic 
objectives and look for 
tangible primary evidence 
of the right path to take.
Be empirical about 
deﬁning and 
delivering value 
Align stakeholders around a 
clear deﬁnition of success 
that cascades into a set of 
tangible metrics. Adopt an 
“always-on” approach to 
performance management 
and continuously monitor and 
adjust metrics in accordance 
with internal and external 
changes. These steps will help 
the organization to conﬁdently 
make decisions and deliver 
the value promised.
Mitigate 
technical debt
Embrace structured 
technical debt 
management. Establish 
clear remediation plans 
and robust architecture 
principles to contain and 
rationalize the technology 
landscape.
Innovation is not 
restricted to new 
technology. Explore new 
ways to collaborate, 
co-invest and share 
risk with your chosen 
partners. Use their 
networks to gain access 
to the latest technology 
and inventive ideas from 
around the globe.
Prioritize trust 
and security 
Ensure solutions are 
secure by design and 
embed trust and security 
assurance from the 
outset. Design, build, 
deploy and use AI and 
emerging tech solutions 
in a responsible and 
ethical manner so 
your organization can 
accelerate value with 
conﬁdence.
Build a strong 
data backbone 
Establish a robust data 
management framework 
that combines data, people, 
processes and policies 
to ensure information 
is reliable, relevant and 
appropriately used. Drive 
a shared understanding 
across the organization 
of how to harness data 
more effectively to support 
rapid and informed 
decision-making.
Develop AI 
proﬁciencies through
knowledge sharing
Test your workforce 
competence and 
sentiment on AI, and 
use this to determine 
the best way to bridge 
knowledge gaps, 
facilitate continuous 
learning and encourage 
cross-functional 
collaboration.

",the digital transformation journey is an important strategic consideration for all sectors but none more so than the technology sector this means it has to do two things simultaneously lead by

services to clients all rights reserved foreword a key theme from this years research is the perception among tech executives that they are struggling to keep up with the pace of change in response to this sense of falling behind organizations may be tempted to make a hurried response however this can lead to misguided investments that may prove both risky and expensive potentially increasing the burden of technical debt which many wellestablished organizations are already struggling with our research suggests that organizations are increasingly aware of this dilemma and they are looking to pivot from imitating others to becoming leaders themselves typically technology leaders are paving the way by bringing structure discipline and an enterprise mindset to the adoption of new technology in doing so they are looking to evidencebased investment decisions that align to the broader business and technology strategies and balance value creation with appetite for risk overall the sense from our respondents is that organizations are doing well with measurable improvement in many areas over the past year mistakes provide great learning opportunities for the future and the positive perspective on progress shared by our survey participants is encouraging 2450 technology professionals worldwide from a variety of industries the relentless speed of technology innovation is undeniable when combined with a natural fear of missing out ideas that may once have seemed like science fiction are rapidly converting into tangible reality from generative ai to quantum computing the potential benefits are huge and so is the risk of making costly mistakes by taking a measured approach to technology investment executives are already benefiting from key advancements while

when measuring the effectiveness of digital transformation or the adoption of a certain piece of tech its important not to get fixated on just one metric you have to think about the implications a metric may have on other metrics and adjust your approach accordingly naveen zutshi cio databricks on balance organizations are content with the outcomes of their digital transformation investments mostly thanks to their ability to make sound decisions along the journey with the pace of change pressuring tech execs organizations must ensure haste does not compromise the quality of their judgment calls investing for the long term is still a good discipline to follow with execs fearing that their organizations are struggling to keep up with the pace of change planning for the long term can be difficult when balancing the needs of the latest technological advancements to maximize progress tech execs should channel digital transformation efforts towards what matters most strategically to their organizations where weve seen organizations achieving the most value from tech is where they step away from the habit of just following a tech trend for the sake of it says michelle chang cfocvp of microsoft customer and partner solutions and instead start with what is our business trying to accomplish whats our purpose and what problems are blocking us from achieving our purpose the answers to these questions will indicate how tech can help them move forward in a meaningful way our studys top performers get this with 53 percent strategically evaluating their tech investment portfolio to ensure it is aligned with their longterm goals compared with 41 percent of other organizations the good news is that most execs want to imbue their tech initiatives to provide value in nontech areas 70 percent ensure that their tech investments directly target their sustainability and social responsibilities executives understand that the value of tech goes beyond financial gain one of the lessons weve learnt is that tech initiatives cannot just be anchored in financial roi thats not the only win available says chang you must have other anchors of improvement in the kpis such as

must be quantifiable and comparable once executives have identified the problem areas that require support from tech they need to deliver and measure value for the executives in our research the three most popular ways of measuring value are in general data maturity has increased with over half of respondents 52 percent on average now at one of the two highest levels of data proficiency the influentialembedded stages up from 40 percent in 2023 cloud platforms play a key role in enhancing proficiency in this area better data management and integration is the most commonly identified gain from increased use of xaas tech organizations can do much more with customer feedback according to our execs directing tech investments towards the service pain points flagged by customers and employees is the most influential tactic for generating quick wins from it investments for instance process points that have multiple handoffs between stakeholders and multiple systems of record with complex contracts can often be riddled with humanerror related execution issues resulting in delays for customers as an example using data mining to identify opportunities to employ smart contracts supported by blockchain or tokenization can target these pain points to speed up processing times and reduce the need for intervention from intermediaries while ensuring strong transparency and security levels look at your major business processes and ask where are inefficiencies dragging you down and keeping your organization from achieving its purpose says microsofts chang these are the points where technology is likely to be uniquely helpful however customer insights tend to be wasted 78 percent of execs say their business fails to use customer feedback effectively perhaps this is because organizations are struggling to decide on the required action to address the user feedback or there may be communication issues between front and back office ultimately unless organizations get better at using customer insights tech execs risk wasting their investments on lowvalue areas business growth metrics such as number of new products launched financial metrics such as costtoserve

decisionmaking forecasting demand and internal performance changes identifying growth and cost optimization opportunities and mitigating potential risks metrics forecasts are a helpful reference point for tracking investment performance enabling informed course correction where required for instance 73 percent of execs say they perform accurate cost forecasts in their digital transformation projects it also follows that the majority 67 percent manage to prevent hidden costs from disrupting their digital transformation journeys but our leading organizations go further compared with other organizations the top performers are more likely to use both qualitative and quantitative metrics to establish causal trends and are more likely to use realtime data to guide decisionmaking by continuously monitoring performance organizations spot where to adjust in response to internal and external influences as such the high performers in the research are 10 percentage points more likely than the mainstream group to regularly review and update their valuetracking metrics to stay aligned with market changes make valuedriven decisions aligned with their longterm goals leaders are

are investing in data accessibility research indicates that only 24 percent are focusing on nurturing a datacentric culture and ensuring data interoperability in the near term this oversight presents a substantial barrier to fully harnessing technologys potential and undermines the ability to effectively use and understand data across all levels of the organization in a landscape increasingly dominated by data its crucial that organizations break down these silos and cultivate a deep enterprisewide appreciation of data strategy by doing so they can accelerate digital transformation towards success by optimizing processes and dynamically enhancing their products and services to meet customers evolving needs for sustainable innovation execs need to prioritize trust and security execs must ensure that pace of innovation is sustainable secure and that they can communicate value to stakeholders the high performers in our research rate risk and cybersecurity metrics including reduced frequency of cybersecurity incidents improved compliance and lower failure rates as the most important lenses through which to evaluate tech they are also more likely to be confident that they can track their performance in these areas this securityled stance of the leader group underlines the wider importance of trust and how to pursue it overall for the executives surveyed cybersecurity and privacy are the biggest concerns for achieving a successful digital transformation they also maintain that the top skill organizations need to thrive in a digital economy is the ability to ensure such considerations are front and center of business and tech priorities of the organization 72 percent of organizations are embracing a securebydesign mindset by involving and empowering cybersecurity teams in the early stages of tech investment projects in fact cybersecurity and privacy can enable organizations to pursue their business objectives securely and confidently and embrace new opportunities organizations need to learn from our high performers group and do more to evaluate tech investments against risk and cybersecurity factors for this to be comprehensive cybersecurity experts need a seat at the table from the outset so they can advise on how security can be embedded to build resilience and trust in doing so cybersecurity and privacy can support the organization as a trust enhancer and protector of brand reputation by minimizing the need for costly retrofitting of security fixes and the risk of data breaches for many organizations there is a disconnect between intentions and reality regarding the securityrelated habits of their workforces almost 8 in 10 78 percent respondents overall say that their staff training treats cybersecurity as a boxticking exercise and it is not embedded as required rather than rely exclusively on formal training sessions organizations should focus on implementing controls and operational features that make cybersecurity easy for employees to embrace in their daily work for instance strategies such as automating devsecops processes or providing access to password manager platforms can promote more secure employee behaviors michael wagner ciso at kenvue agrees that cybersecurity and resilience must be at the forefront of daily tech usage this includes maintaining business continuity plans having a retainer with an incident response firm testing backups and conducting regular recovery exercises incident exercises where different scenarios are presented are vital so that we can be prepared should the worst occur says wagner for instance the crowdstrike patch update issue in july 2024 caused widespread it outages around the globe the wider picture here is that tech innovation is not the enemy of risk management rather they should reinforce each other by starting with a clear definition of success that is rooted in their organizations purpose tech execs will be able to direct tech

key area of focus for improvement over the next 12 months what do the high performers do how are the highperforming organizations strengthening their data backbones and using data as an asset to deliver secure digital transformation outcomes our research suggests these organizations are more likely to involve security teams from the outset executives maintain that cybersecurity and privacy are the biggest concerns for achieving a successful digital transformation but when it comes to security moving at a measured pace is important involving cybersecurity and information governance teams from the outset of digital transformation initiatives will help minimize delays and enable businesses to progress investments confidently to reduce securityrelated downtime battle test your organizations threat response reflexes kenvues wagner suggests that business continuity plans having a retainer with an incident response firm backups testing and regular recovery exercises will prove vital here challenge risk aversion by articulating the costs of inaction a high 80 percent of executives say that a risk averse attitude leads senior leadership to respond to market forces more slowly than competitors when faced with a scenario where risk aversion is influencing senior leadership towards gridlock one helpful tactic to kickstart movement is to evaluate the risks of inaction against the change being considered for instance losing market share to competitors because of a failure to adapt your product offering if analysis reveals that the threats associated with staying idle are too concerning to ignore this can stimulate forward momentum and creative thinking to tackle challenges and manage the risks that come with embracing the change accelerate progress by removing governance bottlenecks poor governance and coordination appear in the top three toughest challenges that derail transformation progress for instance 58 percent say their centralized decisionmaking reduces their organizations ability to respond to market signals and embrace new tech while 57 percent say that friction and communication breakdowns occur frequently between teams at times of high

experimenting with potential ai use cases rather than a stringent centralized approach organizations are adopting a more inclusive mindset around ai experimentation crowdsourcing use cases from their workforces the most popular approach is open collaboration where diverse working groups conduct controlled experiments sometimes supported by ai centers of excellence coes with representatives from every department this approach is prioritized by organizations at the most mature level of ai implementation only 6 percent of organizations subscribe to a topdown approach to ai experimentation with heavy constraints around ai use from the outset while initially encouraging democratized experimentation many respondents 40 percent plan a shift to a more centralized approach once they reach a critical mass of ideas that require stricter management to control risk and reduce duplication in doing so organizations should apply a balanced approach and steer away from overly stringent approval processes to avoid stifling innovation one way of balancing speed with risk is driving alignment through cross functional coes or user groups and only centrally managing ai initiatives that those groups identify as highrisk or high complexity regardless of their chosen experimentation approach organizations have the opportunity to consolidate underlying processing and data infrastructure leading to gains in efficiency reduced technical debt and a more effective end solution a systematic approach is key to prioritizing ai investment in alignment with business goals to ensure the use cases with the greatest potential receive the attention and crossfunctional support they require there must be a strong roadmap to scaling and a clear link to business value many organizations are chasing shortterm value by implementing ai tools in discrete parts of the value chain that is identifying specific use cases for deployment where they see potential to solve problems or drive value this is an understandable approach but they must be careful not to create a tangle of initiatives that become increasingly difficult to track and compare tracking expenditure and return on poorly integrated initiatives is even more pressing given organizations expect to increase investment in ai over the next 12 months their top shortterm goals for ai over the next year are to drive increased operational efficiency via automation improve product and service development and innovation and enhance pattern detection and issue correction data outlining customer behavior and feedback can help organizations understand where to apply ai for maximum effect salesforces sumner raises the example of insurance where automating contact points with customers worked well until policyholders wanted to notify their insurer of a loss insurers were never able to get more than 10 percent of customers to do that online they realized people were looking for human empathy this example shows how truly listening to customers can guide to the right path for delivering real value and its a reminder that ai should be a tool or collaborator for human workers rather than a replacement organizations should move away from disjointed ai use cases and adopt a portfolio approach towards ai focus on maximizing roi while balancing innovation with risk mitigation success that outlasts the hype will require consensus across the enterprise the biggest barrier facing many organizations is moving from experimentation to production says naveen zutshi from databricks in scaling up an ai use case from a poc to a more widespread productionlevel organizational practice the bottleneck is the confidence in the reliability quality and safety of those ai models zutshi says that comes back to data quality

Foreword
A key theme from this year’s research is the perception among 
tech executives that they are struggling to keep up with the pace 
of change. In response to this sense of falling behind, organizations 
may be tempted to make a hurried response. However, this can lead 
to misguided investments that may prove both risky and expensive, 
potentially increasing the burden of technical debt which many 
well-established organizations are already struggling with.
Our research suggests that organizations are increasingly aware of 
this dilemma, and they are looking to pivot from imitating others to 
becoming leaders themselves. Typically, technology leaders are paving 
the way by bringing structure, discipline and an enterprise mindset to 
the adoption of new technology.
In doing so, they are looking to evidence-based investment decisions 
that align to the broader business and technology strategies and balance 
value creation with appetite for risk.
Overall, the sense from our respondents is that organizations are 
doing well with measurable improvement in many areas over the 
past year. Mistakes provide great learning opportunities for the 
future, and the positive perspective on progress shared by our 
survey participants is encouraging.
2,450
technology professionals worldwide 
from a variety of industries
The relentless speed of technology innovation is undeniable. When combined with a natural fear of missing out, 
ideas that may once have seemed like science fiction are rapidly converting into tangible reality. From generative AI 
to quantum computing, the potential benefits are huge, and so is the risk of making costly mistakes.
By taking a measured approach to technology investment, executives 
are already benefiting from key advancements while keeping a firm 
hold on their business models and successfully running the enterprise. 
A willingness to enter the realm of science fiction does not mean leaving 
the facts of sound business management behind.

Foreword
Identifying value amid the hype
To harness the full potential of the 
wave of new tech advancements, 
organizations must sustain a measured, 
strategic approach to investment.
Rapid change is driving fear of missing out (FOMO) 
Our research shows that the rapidly accelerated technology 
innovation over the past year has amplified a strong sense of FOMO 
among organizations. 
The flood of AI-related news entering the mainstream has stirred 
a collective interest in AI that transcends seniority and technical 
expertise. This has only served to stoke the fires of ‘tech-envy’ and 
could encourage a ‘spend now, ask questions later’ attitude.
Digital transformation can bring many exciting benefits, and 
ambition to progress is only healthy, but organizations must not let 
it distort their judgement. Progress paranoia could lead to misguided 
investments and disjointed implementation initiatives. 
Despite FOMO, organizations are taking a more 
balanced approach to investment decisions
While execs continue to look at the trends set by their market peers 
for guidance, this year sees more of them basing investment decisions 
on their own primary evidence. 
This year, executives are drawing on a wider range of sources to 
inform their investment decisions. All investment drivers measured in 
Tapping into the pace of change 
is something we are focused 
on and excited about, all in the 
context of doing so in a safe 
and secure way. 
 
 
Gavin Munroe 
Group Executive of Technology and Group Chief 
Information Officer, Commonwealth Bank of Australia
78%
worry that they 
are struggling 
to keep up with 
the pace of 
change
80%
complain that their senior 
leadership’s risk aversion 
means their organization is 
slower than competitors to 
embrace new technology
2023 have seen an increase in prevalence for 2024 by an average of 
15 percentage points. 
That said, the drivers have shifted in terms of which has the strongest 
influence on tech choices. While following competitors is still a top 
decision driver in 2024, it has fallen to third behind looking to third-party 
guidance (89 percent) and in-house trials and proof of concept (PoC; 
83 percent of the base). This may reflect the desire for organizations to 
overtake competitors in getting emerging tech to market.
Still, for many, FOMO remains a strong influence on investment 
decisions: 82 percent are still choosing tech investments such 
as virtual and augmented reality (VR and AR) in order to follow 
in their competitors’ footsteps. In comparison, the study’s digital 
transformation high performers are 22 percentage points more likely 
than other organizations to rely on customer feedback. And these 
leading organizations place following competitors outside of their top 
three motivations for investing in certain tech.

Compared to 2023, tech implementation maturity has improved across 
the board, with the biggest increases seen in data analytics and XaaS. 
In the 2023 tech report the most common implementation stage 
for XaaS was that companies had a strategic vision but were limited 
because of low buy-in or investment approvals. This year, the majority of 
organizations are proactive in progressing against their XaaS strategies. 
Priorities for further 
investment over the next 
year include XaaS, which 
86% 
chose, as organizations 
focus on the agility and cost 
reductions enabled by cloud 
computing.
Across all tech, ASPAC is the region that is most likely to be at the 
proactive implementation stage, with India and China leading the way. 
Priorities for further investment over the next year include XaaS, 
which 86 percent chose, as organizations focus on the agility and 
cost reductions enabled by cloud computing. Other priorities include 
cybersecurity (68 percent), AI/automation (65 percent) and edge 
computing (61 percent). These investment appetites indicate that 
many organizations put tech at the core of their business strategies.

Foreword
Identifying value amid the hype
What do the high performers do?
How are leading organizations advancing more quickly along their digital transformation 
journeys? Our research suggests these high performers are:
Neglecting legacy systems can compromise new 
tech investments
The desire to accelerate transformation appears to be favored: 
74 percent of organizations say that over the next 12 months, 
they plan to focus on investing in new tech rather than on 
enhancing the value of their existing tech suite. 
There is a risk that the allure of new technologies distracts 
organizations from addressing flaws and technical debt in 
their existing systems. This approach can, in turn, undermine 
transformation progress. 
Often, unresolved issues in current tech infrastructure can 
obstruct the implementation of emerging tech. 
In fact, unaddressed tech debt blocking the path to new 
upgrades is one of the top challenges holding back the digital 
transformation progress of the study’s digital transformation 
high performers. Further, 57 percent of organizations overall say 
that flaws in their foundational enterprise IT systems disrupt 
business-as-usual on a weekly basis. 
“The longer you delay addressing tech debt, the higher the costs 
and risks become,” says Commonwealth Bank of Australia’s 
Gavin Munroe. “Continuous investment is crucial. Accumulated 
tech debt often results in embedded business rules and logic, 
which can make future replacements costly and complex. So, 
it’s essential to consistently invest in unraveling tech debt to 
avoid escalating surprise costs and complexity over time.” 
Organizations must strike a healthy balance between new and 
existing tech investments. Executives’ intentions to prioritize 
XaaS investments will help here. By replacing outdated systems 
and consolidating multiple functions into centralized hubs, XaaS 
platforms can reduce the complexity of infrastructures and the 
volume of redundant tech.
Less likely to be gripped by FOMO:  
In comparison to non-leaders, our leader group is 23 percentage points 
less likely to worry about keeping up with the pace of change. Also, they 
are five percentage points less likely than the mainstream group to be 
choosing technologies because their competitors have already done so. 
Iteratively course-correcting: 
High-performing organizations are adopting a more proactive and 
adaptive approach to evaluating tech investments. As many as 83 percent 
of leaders continuously evaluate the business value and outcomes of all 
tech investments, which is 17 percentage points higher than non-leaders. 
This always-on approach will provide organizations with more opportunity 
to intervene and optimize where required.
Utilizing primary empirical evidence: 
Leaders are 21 percentage points more likely than non-leaders to run 
calculations to forecast the potential value of tech initiative before 
they invest. 
Leaning on external sources of expertise:  
To enhance their digital transformation decision-making, 93 percent of 
our leader group plan to expand and strengthen their ecosystem and 
partnerships, compared with 70 percent of the mainstream sample.
Aware of tech debt: 
In contrast with non-leaders, leading organizations place unaddressed 
tech debt as one of the top challenges holding back digital transformation 
progress. To avoid escalating surprise costs and complexity over time, 
organizations must consistently invest in unraveling tech debt.

Foreword
Optimizing value through evidence-based decisions
When measuring the effectiveness of 
digital transformation or the adoption 
of a certain piece of tech, it’s 
important not to get fixated on just 
one metric. You have to think about 
the implications a metric may have 
on other metrics, and adjust your 
approach accordingly. 
Naveen Zutshi 
CIO, Databricks
On balance, organizations are content 
with the outcomes of their digital 
transformation investments, mostly 
thanks to their ability to make sound 
decisions along the journey. 
With the pace of change pressuring tech 
execs, organizations must ensure haste 
does not compromise the quality of 
their judgment calls.
Investing for the long term is still a good discipline 
to follow
With execs fearing that their organizations are struggling to keep 
up with the pace of change, planning for the long term can be 
difficult when balancing the needs of the latest technological 
advancements. To maximize progress, tech execs should channel 
digital transformation efforts towards what matters most strategically 
to their organizations. 
“Where we’ve seen organizations achieving the most value from 
tech is where they step away from the habit of just following a tech 
trend for the sake of it,” says Michelle Chang, CFO/CVP of Microsoft 
Customer and Partner Solutions. “And, instead, start with, ‘What 
is our business trying to accomplish, what’s our purpose and what 
problems are blocking us from achieving our purpose?’ The answers 
to these questions will indicate how tech can help them move 
forward in a meaningful way.” 
Our study’s top performers get this, with 53 percent strategically 
evaluating their tech investment portfolio to ensure it is aligned 
with their long-term goals (compared with 41 percent of other 
organizations). The good news is that most execs want to imbue 
their tech initiatives to provide value in non-tech areas; 70 percent 
ensure that their tech investments directly target their sustainability 
and social responsibilities. 
Executives understand that the value of tech goes beyond financial 
gain. “One of the lessons we’ve learnt is that tech initiatives cannot 
just be anchored in financial ROI — that’s not the only win available,” 
says Chang. “You must have other anchors of improvement in the 
KPIs, such as creating a better customer experience.”

Organizations are raising the bar on data maturity
According to the group of high performers in our research, frequent data-centric evaluation is one  
of the two effective tactics for achieving quick wins from tech investments. And the wins from  
data-centric approaches are stacking up. Organizations that are in the top two data maturity 
categories across the factors measured are more likely to be satisfied with the value generated 
across all their tech investments. For example, these organizations are likely to achieve better 
service reliability, as they are 18 percentage points less likely to say that flaws in their foundational 
IT systems disrupt business as usual on a weekly basis.
The data management maturity of many organizations is now strengthening across the board, 
setting a new corporate benchmark.

Conclusion and key recommendations
Foreword
Optimizing value through evidence-based decisions
Value must be quantifiable and comparable
Once executives have identified the problem areas that require 
support from tech, they need to deliver and measure value. 
For the executives in our research, the three most popular ways of 
measuring value are: 
In general, data maturity has increased, with over half of respondents 
(52 percent on average) now at one of the two highest levels of data 
proficiency — the influential/embedded stages, up from 40 percent  
in 2023. 
Cloud platforms play a key role in enhancing proficiency in this area. 
Better data management and integration is the most commonly 
identified gain from increased use of XaaS tech.
Organizations can do much more with customer 
feedback
According to our execs, directing tech investments towards the 
service pain points flagged by customers and employees is the 
most influential tactic for generating quick wins from IT investments. 
For instance, process points that have multiple handoffs between 
stakeholders and multiple systems of record, with complex contracts 
can often be riddled with human-error related execution issues 
resulting in delays for customers. As an example, using data mining 
to identify opportunities to employ smart contracts, supported by 
blockchain or tokenization, can target these pain points to speed 
up processing times and reduce the need for intervention from 
intermediaries, while ensuring strong transparency and security levels.
“Look at your major business processes and ask: Where are 
inefficiencies dragging you down and keeping your organization from 
achieving its purpose?” says Microsoft’s Chang. “These are the 
points where technology is likely to be uniquely helpful.” 
However, customer insights tend to be wasted: 78 percent of 
execs say their business fails to use customer feedback effectively. 
Perhaps this is because organizations are struggling to decide on 
the required action to address the user feedback, or there may be 
communication issues between front and back office. Ultimately, 
unless organizations get better at using customer insights, tech 
execs risk wasting their investments on low-value areas.
Business growth metrics, 
such as number of new 
products launched
Financial metrics, such 
as cost-to-serve and 
profitability
Customer-centric metrics, 
such as customer satisfaction 
and customer base growth
78%
of execs say their business 
fails to use customer feedback 
effectively.

Foreword
Optimizing value through evidence-based decisions
What do the high performers do?
Which behaviors set leading organizations apart when it comes to defining and delivering value? Our research suggests they are more 
likely to:
Developing data-backed measurements tailored to the business 
helps organizations establish cause and effect when they choose 
and implement tech. Predictive modeling capabilities, when used 
alongside these metrics, can advance the value creation journey by 
enabling proactive decision-making, forecasting demand and internal 
performance changes, identifying growth and cost optimization 
opportunities, and mitigating potential risks. 
Metrics forecasts are a helpful reference point for tracking 
investment performance, enabling informed course correction 
where required. For instance, 73 percent of execs say they perform 
accurate cost forecasts in their digital transformation projects. It 
also follows that the majority (67 percent) manage to prevent hidden 
costs from disrupting their digital transformation journeys. 
But our leading organizations go further. Compared with other 
organizations, the top performers are more likely to use both 
qualitative and quantitative metrics to establish causal trends, and 
are more likely to use real-time data to guide decision-making. 
By continuously monitoring performance, organizations spot where 
to adjust in response to internal and external influences. As such, 
the high performers in the research are 10 percentage points more 
likely than the mainstream group to regularly review and update their 
value-tracking metrics to stay aligned with market changes. 
Make value-driven decisions aligned with their long-term goals: 
Leaders are dedicated to ensuring their daily decisions contribute to long-term strategic goals and organizational 
definitions of success. Over half (53 percent) of leading organizations strategically evaluate their tech investment 
portfolio to ensure it aligns with their long-term goals, 12 percentage points higher than non-leaders.
Get everyone on the same page: 
Despite the challenge of managing a growing number of priorities and stakeholders, high performers achieve speed 
to action by ensuring they have strong alignment across the organization. For instance, 90 percent of leaders can 
efficiently achieve consensus between stakeholders, whereas other organizations are 18 percentage points less likely 
to be able to do so.
Adopt an “always-on” approach to performance management: 
Leading organizations continually develop the quality and breadth of the inputs that are informing their decisions. 
For instance, leaders are more likely to regularly review and update their value-tracking metrics as the market changes 
and use qualitative and quantitative insights to assess their digital transformation plans.
Master the balance between acting as a risk guardian and a transformation accelerator: 
Leading organizations rank risk and cybersecurity metrics as most important for evaluating tech investments; 
87 percent are confident in their ability to measure this type of value (compared with just 66 percent of other 
organizations). Also these leaders are 21 percentage points more likely to ensure their portfolio of tech investments 
are balanced from a risk perspective.

they troubleshoot the problems 
that threaten their resilience, 
organizations are placing 
cybersecurity and data proficiency 
at the top of their priority lists.
Organizations are prioritizing data security, governance and accessibility
To achieve this level of data proficiency, organizations are pursuing a high level of data security, governance and accessibility through stronger 
compliance programs, frameworks and clear ownership and accountability of roles.

Data both drives and sustains digital transformation. 
Data maturity, security, and governance enable the pace of 
innovation, and can help improve customer experiences. 
Insufficiently secure solutions create the risk of data 
breaches, inefficiencies, or missed opportunities, which 
can erode business value and customer trust. Data security 
and governance form a robust transformation delivery 
infrastructure that underpins an organization’s strategic 
ability to differentiate, maintain cost effectiveness and 
manage risk in the digital era.

Delivering resilient solutions
Data proficiency should be a core 
competency for the organization
While organizations are investing in data accessibility, 
research indicates that only 24 percent are focusing 
on nurturing a data-centric culture and ensuring data 
interoperability in the near term. This oversight presents a 
substantial barrier to fully harnessing technology’s potential 
and undermines the ability to effectively use and understand 
data across all levels of the organization. 
In a landscape increasingly dominated by data, it’s crucial 
that organizations break down these silos and cultivate 
a deep, enterprise-wide appreciation of data strategy. 
By doing so, they can accelerate digital transformation 
towards success by optimizing processes, and dynamically 
enhancing their products and services to meet customers’ 
evolving needs.
For sustainable innovation, execs need 
to prioritize trust and security
Execs must ensure that pace of innovation is sustainable, 
secure and that they can communicate value to 
stakeholders. The high performers in our research rate risk 
and cybersecurity metrics, including reduced frequency of 
cybersecurity incidents, improved compliance and lower 
failure rates, as the most important lenses through which to 
evaluate tech. They are also more likely to be confident that 
they can track their performance in these areas. 
This security-led stance of the leader group underlines the wider 
importance of trust, and how to pursue it. Overall, for the executives 
surveyed, cybersecurity and privacy are the biggest concerns for 
achieving a successful digital transformation. They also maintain that 
the top skill organizations need to thrive in a digital economy is the 
ability to ensure such considerations are front and center of business 
and tech priorities of the organization. 72 percent of organizations are 
embracing a secure-by-design mindset by involving and empowering 
cybersecurity teams in the early stages of tech investment projects. 
In fact, cybersecurity and privacy can enable organizations to pursue 
their business objectives securely and confidently, and embrace new 
opportunities. Organizations need to learn from our high performers 
group and do more to evaluate tech investments against risk and 
cybersecurity factors. For this to be comprehensive, cybersecurity 
experts need a seat at the table from the outset so they can advise 
on how security can be embedded to build resilience and trust. 
In doing so, cybersecurity and privacy can support the organization, 
as a trust enhancer and protector of brand reputation, by minimizing 
the need for costly retrofitting of security fixes and the risk of data 
breaches.
For many organizations, there is a disconnect between intentions 
and reality regarding the security-related habits of their workforces. 
Almost 8 in 10 (78 percent) respondents overall say that their staff 
training treats cybersecurity as a box-ticking exercise and it is not 
embedded as required.
Rather than rely exclusively on formal training sessions, 
organizations should focus on implementing controls and 
operational features that make cybersecurity easy for employees 
to embrace in their daily work. For instance, strategies such as 
automating DevSecOps processes or providing access to password 
manager platforms can promote more secure employee behaviors. 
Michael Wagner, CISO at Kenvue, agrees that cybersecurity and 
resilience must be at the forefront of daily tech usage. This includes 
maintaining business continuity plans, having a retainer with an 
incident response firm, testing backups and conducting regular 
recovery exercises. 
“Incident exercises, where different scenarios are presented, are 
vital so that we can be prepared should the worst occur,” says 
Wagner. “For instance, the CrowdStrike patch update issue [in 
July 2024] caused widespread IT outages around the globe.”
The wider picture here is that tech innovation is not the enemy 
of risk management — rather, they should reinforce each other. 
By starting with a clear definition of success that is rooted in  
their organization’s purpose, tech execs will be able to direct  
tech initiatives towards areas that will bring meaningful value. 
An insight-led approach will enable execs to prioritize and make 
decisions when it comes to delivering value.
Polly Sumner 
Chief Adoption Officer, Salesforce
When data is embedded and people are 
empowered, tools like AI are adopted very 
quickly and this creates value super-fast. 
Start with automation and free up people 
to do what they do best, more quickly and 
in more interesting ways.

Foreword
Delivering resilient solutions
Tie investment to value: 
Leaders consider it a top two priority to ensure data system 
investments align with the priorities of key business stakeholders, 
whereas other organizations place this outside of their top three  
focus areas. 
Perform routine data-hygiene audits: 
Eighty percent of leaders conduct routine data hygiene audits to 
address gaps in data integrity and create data ownership frameworks. 
Other organizations are 31 percentage points less likely to have this as 
a fundamental part of their strategies.
Use data and internal knowledge sharing to respond to 
market risks: 
Leaders say data-centric decision-making (61 percent) and internal 
knowledge sharing (48 percent) enable them to adjust their digital 
transformation strategies in response to evolving market risks 
(compared with 43 and 38 percent, respectively, of non-leaders). 
While data insights can sharpen risk resilience, internal knowledge 
sharing is crucial. By educating employees and keeping them informed 
of developments, organizations will empower them to adapt and 
contribute to positive change.
Prioritize data security:  
Leaders are 9 percentage points more likely than non-leaders to 
cite security as a key area of focus for improvement over the next 
12 months.
What do the high performers do?
How are the high-performing organizations strengthening their data backbones and 
using data as an asset to deliver secure digital transformation outcomes? Our research 
suggests these organizations are more likely to:
Involve security 
teams from the 
outset: 
Executives maintain 
that cybersecurity 
and privacy are the 
biggest concerns for achieving a 
successful digital transformation 
but, when it comes to security, 
moving at a measured pace is 
important. Involving cybersecurity 
and information governance 
teams from the outset of 
digital transformation initiatives 
will help minimize delays and 
enable businesses to progress 
investments confidently. To reduce 
security-related downtime, battle 
test your organization’s threat 
response reflexes. Kenvue’s Wagner 
suggests that business continuity 
plans, having a retainer with an 
incident response firm, backups 
testing and regular recovery 
exercises will prove vital here.
Challenge risk 
aversion by 
articulating the 
costs of inaction: 
A high 80 percent 
of executives say 
that a risk averse attitude leads 
senior leadership to respond to 
market forces more slowly than 
competitors. When faced with 
a scenario where risk aversion 
is influencing senior leadership 
towards gridlock, one helpful 
tactic to kick-start movement is to 
evaluate the risks of inaction against 
the change being considered. For 
instance, losing market share to 
competitors because of a failure 
to adapt your product offering. If 
analysis reveals that the threats 
associated with staying idle are 
too concerning to ignore, this can 
stimulate forward momentum and 
creative thinking to tackle challenges 
and manage the risks that come 
with embracing the change.
Accelerate 
progress by 
removing 
governance 
bottlenecks: 
Poor governance 
and coordination appear in the 
top three toughest challenges 
that derail transformation 
progress. For instance, 
58 percent say their centralized 
decision-making reduces their 
organization’s ability to respond 
to market signals and embrace 
new tech, while 57 percent say 
that friction and communication 
breakdowns occur frequently 
between teams at times of 
high workload.

Scaling AI with confidence
Applying AI as an organization can 
unlock a lot of excitement for your 
workforce because it can really boost 
employee wellbeing.
AI can take the pain out of longstanding 
problems that have previously sapped 
time and energy from employees and, 
in turn, enhance job satisfaction. 
Michelle Chang 
CFO/CVP, Microsoft Customer and Partner Solutions

Almost three-quarters of organizations 
are already achieving business value 
from their AI investments, but only 
one in three has been able to achieve 
this at scale.
Enthusiasm is being fueled by 
democratized experimentation 
approaches, but as use cases scale up 
many predict a tipping point marking a 
drive towards greater centralization. 
The AI ‘black-box’ is causing workforce anxiety
It is positive that 74 percent of respondents say AI is already 
increasing the productivity of their knowledge workers, improving 
their organization’s overall performance. Furthermore, just over 
8 in 10 respondents expect automation efforts to shift the focus of 
knowledge workers towards more creative roles, and that AI will 
even redefine the future of knowledge itself. 
However, AI is also fueling anxiety in the workforce. Consensus 
and trust will be the keys to progress. More than three-quarters 
of organizations (78 percent) are concerned that many users see 
AI as a ‘black box’. Almost as many (77 percent) expect AI to pose 
challenges to their current operational structures, potentially leading 
to job reduction and ethical concerns. 
Managing employee anxiety around change will be critical to AI 
adoption at speed. Those who navigate the evolving tech landscape 
with a focus on employee empowerment, and bringing everyone on 
board, will flourish amid rapid change. Organizations believe their 
workforce has an appetite for cutting-edge tech. But there is also 
fear that some individuals feel left behind by the rapidly evolving 
tech landscape. 
In an era where AI’s rapid evolution and adoption are reshaping the 
competitive landscape, tech execs need to rethink their strategic 
leadership roles. Three-quarters (76 percent) of tech execs surveyed 
feel that their role has evolved significantly over the past two 
years as the nature of tech and the workforce itself is changing. 
Tech execs must manage board level expectations during a period 
of hype cycles and cost sensitivity. At the same time, they must 
balance this against the need for a stable, coherent environment 
in which the workforce can harness AI, rather than stifling it. Tech 
execs play a critical role in steering their organizations through 
uncertain times, acting as a strategic innovator, adaptive pioneer, 
trend navigator and risk guardian. 
To find out more about the use cases for AI across the enterprise, visit our website.
Importantly, there are ways to address such concerns. KPMG’s 
Trusted AI1 framework, for example, emphasizes 10 pillars upon 
which to design, build, deploy and use AI solutions in an ethical 
manner. They include priorities such as fairness, sustainability, 
privacy, security and accountability.

Which of the following best describe how your company is 
experimenting with potential AI use cases?
Rather than a stringent centralized approach, organizations are 
adopting a more inclusive mindset around AI experimentation, 
crowdsourcing use cases from their workforces. The most popular 
approach is open collaboration, where diverse working groups 
conduct controlled experiments, sometimes supported by AI centers 
of excellence (CoEs) with representatives from every department. 
This approach is prioritized by organizations at the most mature level 
of AI implementation. Only 6 percent of organizations subscribe to 
a top-down approach to AI experimentation with heavy constraints 
around AI use from the outset. 
While initially encouraging democratized experimentation, many 
respondents (40 percent) plan a shift to a more centralized approach 
once they reach a critical mass of ideas that require stricter 
management to control risk and reduce duplication. In doing so, 
organizations should apply a balanced approach and steer away from 
overly stringent approval processes to avoid stifling innovation. One 
way of balancing speed with risk is driving alignment through cross-
functional CoEs or user groups, and only centrally managing AI 
initiatives that those groups identify as high-risk or high complexity. 
Regardless of their chosen experimentation approach, organizations 
have the opportunity to consolidate underlying processing and data 
infrastructure leading to gains in efficiency, reduced technical debt 
and a more effective end solution.
A systematic approach is key to prioritizing AI 
investment in alignment with business goals
To ensure the use cases with the greatest potential receive the 
attention and cross-functional support they require, there must be a 
strong roadmap to scaling and a clear link to business value. Many 
organizations are chasing short-term value by implementing AI tools 
in discrete parts of the value chain — that is, identifying specific use 
cases for deployment — where they see potential to solve problems 
or drive value. This is an understandable approach, but they must be 
careful not to create a tangle of initiatives that become increasingly 
difficult to track and compare.
Tracking expenditure and return on poorly integrated initiatives is even 
more pressing, given organizations expect to increase investment in 
AI over the next 12 months. Their top short-term goals for AI over the 
next year are to drive increased operational efficiency via automation, 
improve product and service development and innovation, and 
enhance pattern detection and issue correction. 
Data outlining customer behavior and feedback can help organizations 
understand where to apply AI for maximum effect. Salesforce’s 
Sumner raises the example of insurance, where automating contact 
points with customers worked well until policyholders wanted to 
notify their insurer of a loss. “Insurers were never able to get more 
than 10 percent of customers to do that online. They realized people 
were looking for human empathy.” This example shows how truly 
listening to customers can guide to the right path for delivering real 
value, and it’s a reminder that AI should be a tool or collaborator for 
human workers, rather than a replacement. 
Organizations should move away from disjointed AI use cases, and 
adopt a portfolio approach towards AI, focus on maximizing ROI while 
balancing innovation with risk mitigation.
Success that outlasts the hype will require 
consensus across the enterprise
The biggest barrier facing many organizations is moving from 
experimentation to production, says Naveen Zutshi, from Databricks. 
In scaling up an AI use case from a PoC to a more widespread 
production-level organizational practice, “the bottleneck is the 
confidence in the reliability, quality and safety of those AI models,” 
Zutshi says. “That comes back to data quality. You need to understand 
how the data is flowing: do you have sovereignty rights over the data, 
are you doing the right masking and encryption, and how are you 
looking at access controls right down to row and column level?”

Generative AI is introducing a brand-new risk vector to the tech 
domain, such as ‘hallucinations’, ‘jailbreaks’ and ‘adversarial 
prompting’ that can manipulate AI. The unexpected consequences 
of generated content have appeared seemingly frequently in 
the news this year. In light of this, when scaling emerging tech, 
organizations will need to have the governance and processes in 
place to control emerging risks. Survey respondents highlight the 
importance of continually developing AI governance policies for 
ethical and fair use in line with the evolving regulatory landscape. 
The process of establishing trusted guardrails and controls requires 
a multi-lens end-to-end secure approach to designing, building and 
deployment that incorporates coding best practice, code reviews, 
staff training and red teaming exercises that test the performance 
and reliability of AI models.
The ongoing AI hype may tempt organizations to make hurried 
decisions. However, successful AI adoption requires an enterprise-
wide multidisciplinary effort and a clear alignment across the 
enterprise, and a shared understanding of AI’s role and its potential. 
Organizations that can clearly define and communicate the value of AI 
to all stakeholders within the context of their business objectives, and 
execute through thoughtful collaboration, will have a greater chance of 
maximizing its impact across the enterprise.
As organizations embark on their AI transformation journeys, tech execs are at the forefront of navigating this complex and evolving 
landscape. In order to go beyond the hype and harness the potential of AI while balancing speed, risk, and value, they should focus on 
five key areas: 
Delivering value from AI: 
By aligning AI initiatives with overall business strategy, setting expectations for ROI, and allocating budget to AI transformation.
Unlocking AI capability: 
By upskilling teams to work with AI, setting up organizational governance structures, and identifying capabilities required 
across the business.
Building trust in AI: 
By identifying and addressing risks associated with AI, ensuring data quality and integrity, managing shadow AI and securing 
sensitive data used in AI.
Scaling AI with confidence: 
By deciding whether to build or buy AI capabilities, identifying suitable partners and vendors, and focusing on interoperability 
with existing IT infrastructure.
Architecting AI transformation: 
By engaging with the business and its various leaders to plan AI rollouts by value stream, function, or product, establishing an

Optimizing value through evidence-based decisions
Delivering resilient solutions
Scaling AI with confidence
Foreword
Conclusion and key recommendations
While the pace of digital transformation can 
be daunting, our research shows that many 
organizations are taking considerable strides 
forward in their implementation journeys, 
especially with AI, XaaS and cybersecurity.
The additional profitability that transformation has yielded so far is certainly 
encouraging and organizations are seeking value beyond profits. Execs are 
calibrating their digital transformation formulas to supercharge progress 
across a range of strategic objectives, including ESG responsibilities and 
customer experience elevation.
This year’s findings reveal that primary evidence, such as PoC tests and ROI, 
is taking precedence over a herd mentality. This empirical ethos will be integral 
to securing value and making wise choices, especially as tech execs try to 
balance the maintenance of legacy systems with a focus on new technology. 
To help guard against stakeholder skepticism associated with the safety and 
viability of new digital transformation opportunities, organizations should also 
bring structure, discipline and an enterprise mindset to the adoption of new 
technology, to mitigate risks and optimize value realization. 
The tech execs who make the superior decisions, safely steering their 
organization through various headwinds and risks, will be those that stay 
firmly rooted in a data-centric and value-led approach. These transformers 
will draw on both real-time and predictive data insights from a broad range 
of sources to make balanced judgment calls that align to the broader 
business and tech strategies, to drive sustainable value. 
Organizations that consistently 
demonstrate these behaviors 
can outpace their competition 
and unlock the potential of 
their technology investments, 
securing and growing market 
share as they do so.

Optimizing value through evidence-based decisions
Delivering resilient solutions
Scaling AI with confidence
Foreword
Conclusion and key recommendations
Our respondents demonstrate that AI is already living up to the hype, with the majority of executives confirming they have already achieved business value from AI systems. To maintain momentum, organizations 
should reinforce their data management foundations. As AI PoC experiments are scaled up to production level, data integrity and reliability among other criteria, will dictate whether these innovations result in 
breakthroughs or costly setbacks. 
The attitudes and behaviors of high-performing organizations in this report provide many clues as to how to secure value from tech innovation.
Harness the 
power of 
partnership 
Resist being 
hypnotized by 
FOMO 
While a desire to 
progress and outpace 
your competition is 
healthy, do not let this 
boil over and distort your 
judgment. Rather than 
blindly following the herd, 
anchor decisions in your 
organization’s strategic 
objectives and look for 
tangible primary evidence 
of the right path to take.
Be empirical about 
deﬁning and 
delivering value 
Align stakeholders around a 
clear deﬁnition of success 
that cascades into a set of 
tangible metrics. Adopt an 
“always-on” approach to 
performance management 
and continuously monitor and 
adjust metrics in accordance 
with internal and external 
changes. These steps will help 
the organization to conﬁdently 
make decisions and deliver 
the value promised.
Mitigate 
technical debt
Embrace structured 
technical debt 
management. Establish 
clear remediation plans 
and robust architecture 
principles to contain and 
rationalize the technology 
landscape.
Innovation is not 
restricted to new 
technology. Explore new 
ways to collaborate, 
co-invest and share 
risk with your chosen 
partners. Use their 
networks to gain access 
to the latest technology 
and inventive ideas from 
around the globe.
Prioritize trust 
and security 
Ensure solutions are 
secure by design and 
embed trust and security 
assurance from the 
outset. Design, build, 
deploy and use AI and 
emerging tech solutions 
in a responsible and 
ethical manner so 
your organization can 
accelerate value with 
conﬁdence.
Build a strong 
data backbone 
Establish a robust data 
management framework 
that combines data, people, 
processes and policies 
to ensure information 
is reliable, relevant and 
appropriately used. Drive 
a shared understanding 
across the organization 
of how to harness data 
more effectively to support 
rapid and informed 
decision-making.
Develop AI 
proﬁciencies through
knowledge sharing
Test your workforce 
competence and 
sentiment on AI, and 
use this to determine 
the best way to bridge 
knowledge gaps, 
facilitate continuous 
learning and encourage 
cross-functional 
collaboration.

more of the kpmg international entities kpmg international entities provide no services to clients all rights reserved foreword a key theme from this years research is the perception among tech executives that they are struggling to keep up with the pace of change in response to this sense of falling behind organizations may be tempted to make a hurried response however this can lead to misguided investments that may prove both risky and expensive potentially increasing the burden of technical debt which many wellestablished organizations are already struggling with our research suggests that organizations are increasingly aware of this dilemma and they are looking to pivot from imitating others to becoming leaders themselves typically technology leaders are paving the way by bringing structure discipline and an enterprise mindset to the adoption of new technology in doing so they are looking to evidencebased investment decisions that align to the broader business and technology strategies and balance value creation with appetite for risk overall the sense from our respondents is that organizations are doing well with measurable improvement in many areas over the past year mistakes provide great learning opportunities for the future and the positive perspective on progress shared by our survey participants is encouraging 2450 technology professionals worldwide from a variety of industries the relentless speed of technology innovation is undeniable when combined with a natural fear of missing out ideas that may once have seemed like science fiction are rapidly converting into tangible reality from generative ai to quantum computing the potential benefits are huge and so is the risk of making costly mistakes by taking a measured approach to technology investment executives are already benefiting from key advancements while keeping a firm hold on their business models and successfully running the enterprise a willingness to enter the

existing tech suite there is a risk that the allure of new technologies distracts organizations from addressing flaws and technical debt in their existing systems this approach can in turn undermine

transformation investments mostly thanks to their ability to make sound decisions along the journey with the pace of change pressuring tech execs organizations must ensure haste does not compromise the quality of their judgment calls investing for the long term is still a good discipline to follow with execs fearing that their organizations are struggling to keep up with the pace of change planning for the long term can be difficult when balancing the needs of the latest technological advancements to maximize progress tech execs should channel digital transformation efforts towards what matters most strategically to their organizations where weve seen organizations achieving the most value from tech is where they step away from the habit of just following a tech trend for the sake of it says michelle chang cfocvp of microsoft customer and partner solutions and instead start with what is our business trying to accomplish whats our purpose and what problems are blocking us from achieving our purpose the answers to these questions will indicate how tech can help them move forward in a meaningful way our studys top performers get this with 53 percent strategically evaluating their tech investment portfolio to ensure it is aligned with their longterm goals compared with 41 percent of other organizations the good news is that most execs want to imbue their tech initiatives to provide value in nontech areas 70 percent ensure that their tech investments directly target their sustainability and social responsibilities executives understand that the value of tech goes

evidencebased decisions value must be quantifiable and comparable once executives have identified the problem areas that require support from tech they need to deliver and measure value for the executives in our research the three most popular ways of measuring value are in general data maturity has increased with over half of respondents 52 percent on average now at one of the two highest levels of data proficiency the influentialembedded stages up from 40 percent in 2023 cloud platforms play a key role in enhancing proficiency in this area better data management and integration is the most commonly identified gain from increased use of xaas tech organizations can do much more with customer feedback according to our execs directing tech investments towards the service pain points flagged by customers and employees is the most influential tactic for generating quick wins from it investments for instance process points that have multiple handoffs between stakeholders and multiple systems of record with complex contracts can often be riddled with humanerror related execution issues resulting in delays for customers as an example using data mining to identify opportunities to employ smart contracts supported by blockchain or tokenization can target these pain points to speed up processing times and reduce the need for intervention from intermediaries while ensuring strong transparency and security levels look at your major business processes and ask where are inefficiencies dragging you down and keeping your organization from achieving its purpose says microsofts chang these are the points where technology is likely to be uniquely helpful however customer insights tend to be wasted 78 percent of execs say their business fails to use customer feedback effectively perhaps this is because organizations are struggling to decide on the required action to address the user feedback or there may be communication issues between front and back office ultimately unless organizations get better at using customer insights tech execs risk wasting their investments on lowvalue areas business growth metrics such as number of new products launched financial metrics such as costtoserve and profitability customercentric metrics such as customer satisfaction and customer base growth 78 of execs say their business fails to use customer feedback

identifying value amid the hype delivering resilient solutions scaling ai with confidence conclusion and key recommendations foreword optimizing value through evidencebased decisions what do the high performers do which behaviors set leading organizations apart when it comes to defining and delivering value our research suggests they are more likely to developing databacked measurements tailored to the business helps organizations establish cause and effect when they choose and implement tech predictive modeling capabilities when used alongside these metrics can advance the value creation journey by enabling proactive decisionmaking forecasting demand and internal performance changes identifying growth and cost optimization opportunities and mitigating potential risks metrics forecasts are a helpful reference point for tracking investment performance enabling informed course correction where required for instance 73 percent of execs say they perform accurate cost forecasts in their digital transformation projects it also follows that the majority 67 percent manage to prevent hidden costs from disrupting their digital transformation journeys but our leading organizations go further compared with other organizations the top performers are more likely to use both qualitative and quantitative metrics to establish causal trends and are more likely to use realtime data to guide decisionmaking by continuously monitoring performance organizations spot where to adjust in response to internal and external influences as such the high performers in the research are 10 percentage points more likely than the mainstream group to regularly review and update their valuetracking metrics to stay aligned with market changes make valuedriven decisions aligned with their longterm goals leaders are dedicated to ensuring their daily decisions contribute to longterm strategic goals and organizational definitions of success over half 53 percent of leading organizations strategically evaluate their tech investment portfolio to ensure it aligns with their longterm goals 12 percentage points higher than nonleaders get everyone on the same page despite the challenge of managing a growing number of priorities and stakeholders high performers achieve speed to action by ensuring they have strong alignment across the organization for instance 90 percent of leaders can efficiently achieve consensus between stakeholders whereas other organizations are 18 percentage points less likely to be able to do so adopt an alwayson approach to performance management leading organizations continually develop the quality and breadth of the inputs that are informing their decisions for instance leaders are more likely to regularly review and update their valuetracking metrics as the market changes and use qualitative and quantitative insights to assess their digital transformation plans master the balance between acting as a risk guardian and a transformation accelerator leading organizations rank risk and cybersecurity metrics as most important for evaluating tech investments 87 percent are confident in their ability to measure this type of value compared with just 66 percent of other organizations also these leaders are 21 percentage points more likely to ensure their portfolio of tech investments are balanced from a risk perspective 17 2024 copyright

through evidencebased decisions scaling ai with confidence conclusion and key recommendations foreword delivering resilient solutions data proficiency should be a core competency for the organization while organizations are investing in data accessibility research indicates that only 24 percent are focusing on nurturing a datacentric culture and ensuring data interoperability in the near term this oversight presents a substantial barrier to fully harnessing technologys potential and undermines the ability to effectively use and understand data across all levels of the organization in a landscape increasingly dominated by data its crucial that organizations break down these silos and cultivate a deep enterprisewide appreciation of data strategy by doing so they can accelerate digital transformation towards success by optimizing processes and dynamically enhancing their products and services to meet customers evolving needs for sustainable innovation execs need to prioritize trust and security execs must ensure that pace of innovation is sustainable secure and that they can communicate value to stakeholders the high performers in our research rate risk and cybersecurity metrics including reduced frequency of cybersecurity incidents improved compliance and lower failure rates as the most important lenses through which to evaluate tech they are also more likely to be confident that they can track their performance in these areas this securityled stance of the leader group underlines the wider importance of trust and how to pursue it overall for the executives surveyed cybersecurity and privacy are the biggest concerns for achieving a successful digital transformation they also maintain that the top skill organizations need to thrive in a digital economy is the ability to ensure such considerations are front and center of business and tech priorities of the organization 72 percent of organizations are embracing a securebydesign mindset by involving and empowering cybersecurity teams in the early stages of tech investment projects in fact cybersecurity and privacy can enable organizations to pursue their business objectives securely and confidently and embrace new opportunities organizations need to learn from our high performers group and do more to evaluate tech investments against risk and cybersecurity factors for this to be comprehensive cybersecurity experts need a seat at the table from the outset so they can advise on how security can be embedded to build resilience and trust in doing so cybersecurity and privacy can support the organization as a trust enhancer and protector of brand reputation by minimizing the need for costly retrofitting of security fixes and the risk of data breaches for many organizations there is a disconnect between intentions and reality regarding the securityrelated habits of their workforces almost 8 in 10 78 percent respondents overall say that their staff training treats cybersecurity as a boxticking exercise and it is not embedded as required rather than rely exclusively on formal training sessions organizations should focus on implementing controls and operational features that make cybersecurity easy for employees to embrace in their daily work for instance strategies such as automating devsecops processes or providing access to password manager platforms can promote more secure employee behaviors michael wagner ciso at kenvue agrees that cybersecurity and resilience must be at the forefront of daily tech usage this includes maintaining business continuity plans having a retainer with an incident response firm testing backups and conducting regular recovery exercises incident exercises where different scenarios are presented are vital so that we can be prepared should the worst occur says wagner for instance the crowdstrike patch update issue in july 2024 caused widespread it outages around the globe the wider picture here is that tech innovation is not the enemy of risk management rather they should reinforce each other by starting with a clear definition of success that is rooted in their organizations purpose tech execs will be able to direct tech initiatives towards areas that will bring meaningful value an insightled approach will enable execs to prioritize and make decisions when it comes to delivering value polly sumner chief adoption

other organizations place this outside of their top three focus areas perform routine datahygiene audits eighty percent of leaders conduct routine data hygiene audits to address gaps in data integrity and create data ownership frameworks other organizations are 31 percentage points less likely to have this as a fundamental part of their strategies use data and internal knowledge sharing to respond to market risks leaders say datacentric decisionmaking 61 percent and internal knowledge sharing 48 percent enable them to adjust their digital transformation strategies in response to evolving market risks compared with 43 and 38 percent respectively of nonleaders while data insights can sharpen risk resilience internal knowledge sharing is crucial by educating employees and keeping them informed of developments organizations will empower them to adapt and contribute to positive change prioritize data security leaders are 9 percentage points more likely than nonleaders to cite security as a key area of focus for improvement over the next 12 months what do the high performers do how are the highperforming organizations strengthening their data backbones and using data as an asset to deliver secure digital transformation outcomes our research suggests these organizations are more likely to involve security teams from the outset executives maintain that cybersecurity and privacy are the biggest concerns for achieving a successful digital transformation but when it comes to security moving at a measured pace is important involving cybersecurity and information governance teams from the outset of digital transformation initiatives will help minimize delays and enable businesses to progress investments confidently to reduce securityrelated downtime battle test your organizations threat response reflexes kenvues wagner suggests that business continuity plans having a retainer with an incident response firm backups testing and regular recovery exercises will prove vital here challenge risk aversion by articulating the costs of inaction a high 80 percent of executives say that a risk averse attitude leads senior leadership to respond to market forces more slowly than competitors when faced with a scenario where risk aversion is influencing senior leadership towards gridlock one helpful tactic to kickstart movement is to evaluate the risks of inaction against the change being considered for instance losing market share to competitors because of a failure to adapt your product offering if analysis reveals that the threats associated with staying idle are too concerning to ignore this can stimulate forward momentum and creative thinking to tackle challenges and manage the risks that come with embracing the change accelerate progress by removing governance bottlenecks poor governance and coordination appear in the top three toughest challenges that derail transformation progress for instance 58 percent say their centralized decisionmaking reduces their organizations ability to respond to market signals and embrace new tech while 57 percent say that friction and communication breakdowns occur frequently between teams at times of high workload 01 02 03 how to overcome threats to digital transformation executives are keen to speed up their tech progress but to do so reliably effective risk management is essential consider the

blackbox is causing workforce anxiety it is positive that 74 percent of respondents say ai is already increasing the productivity of their knowledge workers improving their organizations overall performance furthermore just over 8 in 10 respondents expect automation efforts to shift the focus of knowledge workers towards more creative roles and that ai will even redefine the future of knowledge itself however ai is also fueling anxiety in the workforce consensus and trust will be the keys to progress more than threequarters of organizations 78 percent are concerned that many users see ai as a black box almost as many 77 percent expect ai to pose challenges to their current operational structures potentially leading to job reduction and ethical concerns managing employee anxiety around change will be critical to ai adoption at speed those who navigate the evolving tech landscape with a focus on employee empowerment and bringing everyone on board will flourish amid rapid change organizations believe their workforce has an appetite for cuttingedge tech but there is also fear that some individuals feel left behind by the rapidly evolving tech landscape in an era where ais rapid evolution and adoption are reshaping the competitive landscape tech execs need to rethink their strategic leadership roles threequarters 76 percent of tech execs surveyed feel that their role has evolved significantly over the past two years as the nature of tech and the workforce itself is changing tech execs must manage board level expectations during a period of hype cycles and

achieved roi on a number of our ai use cases strategically investing in ai we have invested strategically in core business capabilities and have ai use cases running actively across the organization that are returning business value testing ai we have a large number of ai proofofconcept tests running but havent achieved roi yet we have a limited number of ad hoc use cases in production early stage we have a small number of ai proofofconcept experiments not started we havent implemented any ai yet but plan to at some point in the future notably organizations in certain countries including

40 open collaboration we have controlled groups of experimentation or ai centers of excellence featuring employees from every department across our business selective collaboration our dedicated ai team invites consultation from employees in different departments and decides on which ones to pursue topdown experimentation we have heavy constraints around ai use authorized ai use cases are being rolled out by our aiit team and employees are prohibited from using ai for anything else we are not experimenting with ai yet 19 6 1 which of the following best describe how your company is experimenting with potential ai use cases rather than a stringent centralized approach organizations are adopting a more inclusive mindset around ai experimentation crowdsourcing use cases from their workforces the most popular approach is open collaboration where diverse working groups conduct controlled experiments sometimes supported by ai centers of excellence coes with representatives from every department this approach is prioritized by organizations at the most mature level of ai implementation only 6 percent of organizations subscribe to a topdown approach to ai experimentation with heavy constraints around ai use from the outset while initially encouraging democratized experimentation many respondents 40 percent plan a shift to a more centralized approach once they reach a critical mass of ideas that require stricter management to control risk and reduce duplication in doing so organizations should apply a balanced approach and steer away from overly stringent approval processes to avoid stifling innovation one way of balancing speed with risk is driving alignment through cross functional coes or user groups and only centrally managing ai initiatives that those groups identify as highrisk or high complexity regardless of their chosen experimentation approach organizations have the opportunity to consolidate underlying processing and data infrastructure leading to gains in efficiency reduced technical debt and a more effective end solution a systematic approach is key to prioritizing ai investment in alignment with business goals to ensure the use cases with the greatest potential receive the attention and crossfunctional support they require there must be a strong roadmap to scaling and a clear link to business value many organizations are chasing shortterm value by implementing ai tools in discrete parts of the value chain that is identifying specific use cases for deployment where they see potential to solve problems or drive value this is an understandable approach but they must be careful not to create a tangle of initiatives that become increasingly difficult to track and compare tracking expenditure and return on poorly integrated initiatives is even more pressing given organizations expect to increase investment in ai over the next 12 months their top shortterm goals for ai over the next year are to drive increased operational efficiency via automation improve product and service development and innovation and enhance pattern detection and issue correction data outlining customer behavior and feedback can help organizations understand where to apply ai for maximum effect salesforces sumner raises the example of insurance where automating contact points with customers worked well until policyholders wanted to notify their insurer of a loss insurers were never able to get more than 10 percent of customers to do that online they realized people were looking for human empathy this example shows how truly listening to customers can guide to the right path for delivering real value and its a reminder that ai should be a tool or collaborator for human workers rather than a replacement organizations should move away from disjointed ai use cases and adopt a portfolio approach towards ai focus on maximizing roi while balancing innovation with risk mitigation success that outlasts the hype will require consensus across the enterprise the biggest barrier facing many organizations is moving from experimentation to production says naveen zutshi from databricks in scaling up an ai use case from a poc to a more widespread productionlevel organizational practice the bottleneck is the confidence in the reliability quality and safety of those ai models zutshi says that comes back to data quality

Foreword
A key theme from this year’s research is the perception among 
tech executives that they are struggling to keep up with the pace 
of change. In response to this sense of falling behind, organizations 
may be tempted to make a hurried response. However, this can lead 
to misguided investments that may prove both risky and expensive, 
potentially increasing the burden of technical debt which many 
well-established organizations are already struggling with.
Our research suggests that organizations are increasingly aware of 
this dilemma, and they are looking to pivot from imitating others to 
becoming leaders themselves. Typically, technology leaders are paving 
the way by bringing structure, discipline and an enterprise mindset to 
the adoption of new technology.
In doing so, they are looking to evidence-based investment decisions 
that align to the broader business and technology strategies and balance 
value creation with appetite for risk.
Overall, the sense from our respondents is that organizations are 
doing well with measurable improvement in many areas over the 
past year. Mistakes provide great learning opportunities for the 
future, and the positive perspective on progress shared by our 
survey participants is encouraging.
2,450
technology professionals worldwide 
from a variety of industries
The relentless speed of technology innovation is undeniable. When combined with a natural fear of missing out, 
ideas that may once have seemed like science fiction are rapidly converting into tangible reality. From generative AI 
to quantum computing, the potential benefits are huge, and so is the risk of making costly mistakes.
By taking a measured approach to technology investment, executives 
are already benefiting from key advancements while keeping a firm 
hold on their business models and successfully running the enterprise. 
A willingness to enter the realm of science fiction does not mean leaving 
the facts of sound business management behind.

Foreword
Identifying value amid the hype
To harness the full potential of the 
wave of new tech advancements, 
organizations must sustain a measured, 
strategic approach to investment.
Rapid change is driving fear of missing out (FOMO) 
Our research shows that the rapidly accelerated technology 
innovation over the past year has amplified a strong sense of FOMO 
among organizations. 
The flood of AI-related news entering the mainstream has stirred 
a collective interest in AI that transcends seniority and technical 
expertise. This has only served to stoke the fires of ‘tech-envy’ and 
could encourage a ‘spend now, ask questions later’ attitude.
Digital transformation can bring many exciting benefits, and 
ambition to progress is only healthy, but organizations must not let 
it distort their judgement. Progress paranoia could lead to misguided 
investments and disjointed implementation initiatives. 
Despite FOMO, organizations are taking a more 
balanced approach to investment decisions
While execs continue to look at the trends set by their market peers 
for guidance, this year sees more of them basing investment decisions 
on their own primary evidence. 
This year, executives are drawing on a wider range of sources to 
inform their investment decisions. All investment drivers measured in 
Tapping into the pace of change 
is something we are focused 
on and excited about, all in the 
context of doing so in a safe 
and secure way. 
 
 
Gavin Munroe 
Group Executive of Technology and Group Chief 
Information Officer, Commonwealth Bank of Australia
78%
worry that they 
are struggling 
to keep up with 
the pace of 
change
80%
complain that their senior 
leadership’s risk aversion 
means their organization is 
slower than competitors to 
embrace new technology
2023 have seen an increase in prevalence for 2024 by an average of 
15 percentage points. 
That said, the drivers have shifted in terms of which has the strongest 
influence on tech choices. While following competitors is still a top 
decision driver in 2024, it has fallen to third behind looking to third-party 
guidance (89 percent) and in-house trials and proof of concept (PoC; 
83 percent of the base). This may reflect the desire for organizations to 
overtake competitors in getting emerging tech to market.
Still, for many, FOMO remains a strong influence on investment 
decisions: 82 percent are still choosing tech investments such 
as virtual and augmented reality (VR and AR) in order to follow 
in their competitors’ footsteps. In comparison, the study’s digital 
transformation high performers are 22 percentage points more likely 
than other organizations to rely on customer feedback. And these 
leading organizations place following competitors outside of their top 
three motivations for investing in certain tech.

Compared to 2023, tech implementation maturity has improved across 
the board, with the biggest increases seen in data analytics and XaaS. 
In the 2023 tech report the most common implementation stage 
for XaaS was that companies had a strategic vision but were limited 
because of low buy-in or investment approvals. This year, the majority of 
organizations are proactive in progressing against their XaaS strategies. 
Priorities for further 
investment over the next 
year include XaaS, which 
86% 
chose, as organizations 
focus on the agility and cost 
reductions enabled by cloud 
computing.
Across all tech, ASPAC is the region that is most likely to be at the 
proactive implementation stage, with India and China leading the way. 
Priorities for further investment over the next year include XaaS, 
which 86 percent chose, as organizations focus on the agility and 
cost reductions enabled by cloud computing. Other priorities include 
cybersecurity (68 percent), AI/automation (65 percent) and edge 
computing (61 percent). These investment appetites indicate that 
many organizations put tech at the core of their business strategies.

What do the high performers do?
How are leading organizations advancing more quickly along their digital transformation 
journeys? Our research suggests these high performers are:
Neglecting legacy systems can compromise new 
tech investments
The desire to accelerate transformation appears to be favored: 
74 percent of organizations say that over the next 12 months, 
they plan to focus on investing in new tech rather than on 
enhancing the value of their existing tech suite. 
There is a risk that the allure of new technologies distracts 
organizations from addressing flaws and technical debt in 
their existing systems. This approach can, in turn, undermine 
transformation progress. 
Often, unresolved issues in current tech infrastructure can 
obstruct the implementation of emerging tech. 
In fact, unaddressed tech debt blocking the path to new 
upgrades is one of the top challenges holding back the digital 
transformation progress of the study’s digital transformation 
high performers. Further, 57 percent of organizations overall say 
that flaws in their foundational enterprise IT systems disrupt 
business-as-usual on a weekly basis. 
“The longer you delay addressing tech debt, the higher the costs 
and risks become,” says Commonwealth Bank of Australia’s 
Gavin Munroe. “Continuous investment is crucial. Accumulated 
tech debt often results in embedded business rules and logic, 
which can make future replacements costly and complex. So, 
it’s essential to consistently invest in unraveling tech debt to 
avoid escalating surprise costs and complexity over time.” 
Organizations must strike a healthy balance between new and 
existing tech investments. Executives’ intentions to prioritize 
XaaS investments will help here. By replacing outdated systems 
and consolidating multiple functions into centralized hubs, XaaS 
platforms can reduce the complexity of infrastructures and the 
volume of redundant tech.
Less likely to be gripped by FOMO:  
In comparison to non-leaders, our leader group is 23 percentage points 
less likely to worry about keeping up with the pace of change. Also, they 
are five percentage points less likely than the mainstream group to be 
choosing technologies because their competitors have already done so. 
Iteratively course-correcting: 
High-performing organizations are adopting a more proactive and 
adaptive approach to evaluating tech investments. As many as 83 percent 
of leaders continuously evaluate the business value and outcomes of all 
tech investments, which is 17 percentage points higher than non-leaders. 
This always-on approach will provide organizations with more opportunity 
to intervene and optimize where required.
Utilizing primary empirical evidence: 
Leaders are 21 percentage points more likely than non-leaders to run 
calculations to forecast the potential value of tech initiative before 
they invest. 
Leaning on external sources of expertise:  
To enhance their digital transformation decision-making, 93 percent of 
our leader group plan to expand and strengthen their ecosystem and 
partnerships, compared with 70 percent of the mainstream sample.
Aware of tech debt: 
In contrast with non-leaders, leading organizations place unaddressed 
tech debt as one of the top challenges holding back digital transformation 
progress. To avoid escalating surprise costs and complexity over time, 
organizations must consistently invest in unraveling tech debt.

Optimizing value through evidence-based decisions
When measuring the effectiveness of 
digital transformation or the adoption 
of a certain piece of tech, it’s 
important not to get fixated on just 
one metric. You have to think about 
the implications a metric may have 
on other metrics, and adjust your 
approach accordingly. 
Naveen Zutshi 
CIO, Databricks
On balance, organizations are content 
with the outcomes of their digital 
transformation investments, mostly 
thanks to their ability to make sound 
decisions along the journey. 
With the pace of change pressuring tech 
execs, organizations must ensure haste 
does not compromise the quality of 
their judgment calls.
Investing for the long term is still a good discipline 
to follow
With execs fearing that their organizations are struggling to keep 
up with the pace of change, planning for the long term can be 
difficult when balancing the needs of the latest technological 
advancements. To maximize progress, tech execs should channel 
digital transformation efforts towards what matters most strategically 
to their organizations. 
“Where we’ve seen organizations achieving the most value from 
tech is where they step away from the habit of just following a tech 
trend for the sake of it,” says Michelle Chang, CFO/CVP of Microsoft 
Customer and Partner Solutions. “And, instead, start with, ‘What 
is our business trying to accomplish, what’s our purpose and what 
problems are blocking us from achieving our purpose?’ The answers 
to these questions will indicate how tech can help them move 
forward in a meaningful way.” 
Our study’s top performers get this, with 53 percent strategically 
evaluating their tech investment portfolio to ensure it is aligned 
with their long-term goals (compared with 41 percent of other 
organizations). The good news is that most execs want to imbue 
their tech initiatives to provide value in non-tech areas; 70 percent 
ensure that their tech investments directly target their sustainability 
and social responsibilities. 
Executives understand that the value of tech goes beyond financial 
gain. “One of the lessons we’ve learnt is that tech initiatives cannot 
just be anchored in financial ROI — that’s not the only win available,” 
says Chang. “You must have other anchors of improvement in the 
KPIs, such as creating a better customer experience.”

Organizations are raising the bar on data maturity
According to the group of high performers in our research, frequent data-centric evaluation is one  
of the two effective tactics for achieving quick wins from tech investments. And the wins from  
data-centric approaches are stacking up. Organizations that are in the top two data maturity 
categories across the factors measured are more likely to be satisfied with the value generated 
across all their tech investments. For example, these organizations are likely to achieve better 
service reliability, as they are 18 percentage points less likely to say that flaws in their foundational

Foreword
Optimizing value through evidence-based decisions
Value must be quantifiable and comparable
Once executives have identified the problem areas that require 
support from tech, they need to deliver and measure value. 
For the executives in our research, the three most popular ways of 
measuring value are: 
In general, data maturity has increased, with over half of respondents 
(52 percent on average) now at one of the two highest levels of data 
proficiency — the influential/embedded stages, up from 40 percent  
in 2023. 
Cloud platforms play a key role in enhancing proficiency in this area. 
Better data management and integration is the most commonly 
identified gain from increased use of XaaS tech.
Organizations can do much more with customer 
feedback
According to our execs, directing tech investments towards the 
service pain points flagged by customers and employees is the 
most influential tactic for generating quick wins from IT investments. 
For instance, process points that have multiple handoffs between 
stakeholders and multiple systems of record, with complex contracts 
can often be riddled with human-error related execution issues 
resulting in delays for customers. As an example, using data mining 
to identify opportunities to employ smart contracts, supported by 
blockchain or tokenization, can target these pain points to speed 
up processing times and reduce the need for intervention from 
intermediaries, while ensuring strong transparency and security levels.
“Look at your major business processes and ask: Where are 
inefficiencies dragging you down and keeping your organization from 
achieving its purpose?” says Microsoft’s Chang. “These are the 
points where technology is likely to be uniquely helpful.” 
However, customer insights tend to be wasted: 78 percent of 
execs say their business fails to use customer feedback effectively. 
Perhaps this is because organizations are struggling to decide on 
the required action to address the user feedback, or there may be 
communication issues between front and back office. Ultimately, 
unless organizations get better at using customer insights, tech 
execs risk wasting their investments on low-value areas.

Foreword
Optimizing value through evidence-based decisions
What do the high performers do?
Which behaviors set leading organizations apart when it comes to defining and delivering value? Our research suggests they are more 
likely to:
Developing data-backed measurements tailored to the business 
helps organizations establish cause and effect when they choose 
and implement tech. Predictive modeling capabilities, when used 
alongside these metrics, can advance the value creation journey by 
enabling proactive decision-making, forecasting demand and internal 
performance changes, identifying growth and cost optimization 
opportunities, and mitigating potential risks. 
Metrics forecasts are a helpful reference point for tracking 
investment performance, enabling informed course correction 
where required. For instance, 73 percent of execs say they perform 
accurate cost forecasts in their digital transformation projects. It 
also follows that the majority (67 percent) manage to prevent hidden 
costs from disrupting their digital transformation journeys. 
But our leading organizations go further. Compared with other 
organizations, the top performers are more likely to use both 
qualitative and quantitative metrics to establish causal trends, and 
are more likely to use real-time data to guide decision-making. 
By continuously monitoring performance, organizations spot where 
to adjust in response to internal and external influences. As such, 
the high performers in the research are 10 percentage points more 
likely than the mainstream group to regularly review and update their 
value-tracking metrics to stay aligned with market changes. 
Make value-driven decisions aligned with their long-term goals: 
Leaders are dedicated to ensuring their daily decisions contribute to long-term strategic goals and organizational 
definitions of success. Over half (53 percent) of leading organizations strategically evaluate their tech investment 
portfolio to ensure it aligns with their long-term goals, 12 percentage points higher than non-leaders.
Get everyone on the same page: 
Despite the challenge of managing a growing number of priorities and stakeholders, high performers achieve speed 
to action by ensuring they have strong alignment across the organization. For instance, 90 percent of leaders can 
efficiently achieve consensus between stakeholders, whereas other organizations are 18 percentage points less likely 
to be able to do so.
Adopt an “always-on” approach to performance management: 
Leading organizations continually develop the quality and breadth of the inputs that are informing their decisions. 
For instance, leaders are more likely to regularly review and update their value-tracking metrics as the market changes 
and use qualitative and quantitative insights to assess their digital transformation plans.
Master the balance between acting as a risk guardian and a transformation accelerator: 
Leading organizations rank risk and cybersecurity metrics as most important for evaluating tech investments; 
87 percent are confident in their ability to measure this type of value (compared with just 66 percent of other 
organizations). Also these leaders are 21 percentage points more likely to ensure their portfolio of tech investments 
are balanced from a risk perspective.

Securing the most value from 
identified opportunities relies on 
robust data-driven processes, 
security and governance. As 
they troubleshoot the problems 
that threaten their resilience, 
organizations are placing 
cybersecurity and data proficiency 
at the top of their priority lists.
Organizations are prioritizing data security, governance and accessibility
To achieve this level of data proficiency, organizations are pursuing a high level of data security, governance and accessibility through stronger 
compliance programs, frameworks and clear ownership and accountability of roles.

Data both drives and sustains digital transformation. 
Data maturity, security, and governance enable the pace of 
innovation, and can help improve customer experiences. 
Insufficiently secure solutions create the risk of data 
breaches, inefficiencies, or missed opportunities, which 
can erode business value and customer trust. Data security 
and governance form a robust transformation delivery 
infrastructure that underpins an organization’s strategic 
ability to differentiate, maintain cost effectiveness and 
manage risk in the digital era.

Delivering resilient solutions
Data proficiency should be a core 
competency for the organization
While organizations are investing in data accessibility, 
research indicates that only 24 percent are focusing 
on nurturing a data-centric culture and ensuring data 
interoperability in the near term. This oversight presents a 
substantial barrier to fully harnessing technology’s potential 
and undermines the ability to effectively use and understand 
data across all levels of the organization. 
In a landscape increasingly dominated by data, it’s crucial 
that organizations break down these silos and cultivate 
a deep, enterprise-wide appreciation of data strategy. 
By doing so, they can accelerate digital transformation 
towards success by optimizing processes, and dynamically 
enhancing their products and services to meet customers’ 
evolving needs.
For sustainable innovation, execs need 
to prioritize trust and security
Execs must ensure that pace of innovation is sustainable, 
secure and that they can communicate value to 
stakeholders. The high performers in our research rate risk 
and cybersecurity metrics, including reduced frequency of 
cybersecurity incidents, improved compliance and lower 
failure rates, as the most important lenses through which to 
evaluate tech. They are also more likely to be confident that 
they can track their performance in these areas. 
This security-led stance of the leader group underlines the wider 
importance of trust, and how to pursue it. Overall, for the executives 
surveyed, cybersecurity and privacy are the biggest concerns for 
achieving a successful digital transformation. They also maintain that 
the top skill organizations need to thrive in a digital economy is the 
ability to ensure such considerations are front and center of business 
and tech priorities of the organization. 72 percent of organizations are 
embracing a secure-by-design mindset by involving and empowering 
cybersecurity teams in the early stages of tech investment projects. 
In fact, cybersecurity and privacy can enable organizations to pursue 
their business objectives securely and confidently, and embrace new 
opportunities. Organizations need to learn from our high performers 
group and do more to evaluate tech investments against risk and 
cybersecurity factors. For this to be comprehensive, cybersecurity 
experts need a seat at the table from the outset so they can advise 
on how security can be embedded to build resilience and trust. 
In doing so, cybersecurity and privacy can support the organization, 
as a trust enhancer and protector of brand reputation, by minimizing 
the need for costly retrofitting of security fixes and the risk of data 
breaches.
For many organizations, there is a disconnect between intentions 
and reality regarding the security-related habits of their workforces. 
Almost 8 in 10 (78 percent) respondents overall say that their staff 
training treats cybersecurity as a box-ticking exercise and it is not 
embedded as required.
Rather than rely exclusively on formal training sessions, 
organizations should focus on implementing controls and 
operational features that make cybersecurity easy for employees 
to embrace in their daily work. For instance, strategies such as 
automating DevSecOps processes or providing access to password 
manager platforms can promote more secure employee behaviors. 
Michael Wagner, CISO at Kenvue, agrees that cybersecurity and 
resilience must be at the forefront of daily tech usage. This includes 
maintaining business continuity plans, having a retainer with an 
incident response firm, testing backups and conducting regular 
recovery exercises. 
“Incident exercises, where different scenarios are presented, are 
vital so that we can be prepared should the worst occur,” says 
Wagner. “For instance, the CrowdStrike patch update issue [in 
July 2024] caused widespread IT outages around the globe.”
The wider picture here is that tech innovation is not the enemy 
of risk management — rather, they should reinforce each other. 
By starting with a clear definition of success that is rooted in  
their organization’s purpose, tech execs will be able to direct  
tech initiatives towards areas that will bring meaningful value. 
An insight-led approach will enable execs to prioritize and make 
decisions when it comes to delivering value.
Polly Sumner 
Chief Adoption Officer, Salesforce
When data is embedded and people are 
empowered, tools like AI are adopted very 
quickly and this creates value super-fast. 
Start with automation and free up people 
to do what they do best, more quickly and 
in more interesting ways.

Foreword
Delivering resilient solutions
Tie investment to value: 
Leaders consider it a top two priority to ensure data system 
investments align with the priorities of key business stakeholders, 
whereas other organizations place this outside of their top three  
focus areas. 
Perform routine data-hygiene audits: 
Eighty percent of leaders conduct routine data hygiene audits to 
address gaps in data integrity and create data ownership frameworks. 
Other organizations are 31 percentage points less likely to have this as 
a fundamental part of their strategies.
Use data and internal knowledge sharing to respond to 
market risks: 
Leaders say data-centric decision-making (61 percent) and internal 
knowledge sharing (48 percent) enable them to adjust their digital 
transformation strategies in response to evolving market risks 
(compared with 43 and 38 percent, respectively, of non-leaders). 
While data insights can sharpen risk resilience, internal knowledge 
sharing is crucial. By educating employees and keeping them informed 
of developments, organizations will empower them to adapt and 
contribute to positive change.
Prioritize data security:  
Leaders are 9 percentage points more likely than non-leaders to 
cite security as a key area of focus for improvement over the next 
12 months.
What do the high performers do?
How are the high-performing organizations strengthening their data backbones and 
using data as an asset to deliver secure digital transformation outcomes? Our research 
suggests these organizations are more likely to:
Involve security 
teams from the 
outset: 
Executives maintain 
that cybersecurity 
and privacy are the 
biggest concerns for achieving a 
successful digital transformation 
but, when it comes to security, 
moving at a measured pace is 
important. Involving cybersecurity 
and information governance 
teams from the outset of 
digital transformation initiatives 
will help minimize delays and 
enable businesses to progress 
investments confidently. To reduce 
security-related downtime, battle 
test your organization’s threat 
response reflexes. Kenvue’s Wagner 
suggests that business continuity 
plans, having a retainer with an 
incident response firm, backups 
testing and regular recovery 
exercises will prove vital here.
Challenge risk 
aversion by 
articulating the 
costs of inaction: 
A high 80 percent 
of executives say 
that a risk averse attitude leads 
senior leadership to respond to 
market forces more slowly than 
competitors. When faced with 
a scenario where risk aversion 
is influencing senior leadership 
towards gridlock, one helpful 
tactic to kick-start movement is to 
evaluate the risks of inaction against 
the change being considered. For 
instance, losing market share to 
competitors because of a failure 
to adapt your product offering. If 
analysis reveals that the threats 
associated with staying idle are 
too concerning to ignore, this can 
stimulate forward momentum and 
creative thinking to tackle challenges 
and manage the risks that come 
with embracing the change.
Accelerate 
progress by 
removing 
governance 
bottlenecks: 
Poor governance 
and coordination appear in the 
top three toughest challenges 
that derail transformation 
progress. For instance, 
58 percent say their centralized 
decision-making reduces their 
organization’s ability to respond 
to market signals and embrace 
new tech, while 57 percent say 
that friction and communication 
breakdowns occur frequently 
between teams at times of 
high workload.

Scaling AI with confidence
Applying AI as an organization can 
unlock a lot of excitement for your 
workforce because it can really boost 
employee wellbeing.
AI can take the pain out of longstanding 
problems that have previously sapped 
time and energy from employees and, 
in turn, enhance job satisfaction. 
Michelle Chang 
CFO/CVP, Microsoft Customer and Partner Solutions

Almost three-quarters of organizations 
are already achieving business value 
from their AI investments, but only 
one in three has been able to achieve 
this at scale.
Enthusiasm is being fueled by 
democratized experimentation 
approaches, but as use cases scale up 
many predict a tipping point marking a 
drive towards greater centralization. 
The AI ‘black-box’ is causing workforce anxiety
It is positive that 74 percent of respondents say AI is already 
increasing the productivity of their knowledge workers, improving 
their organization’s overall performance. Furthermore, just over 
8 in 10 respondents expect automation efforts to shift the focus of 
knowledge workers towards more creative roles, and that AI will 
even redefine the future of knowledge itself. 
However, AI is also fueling anxiety in the workforce. Consensus 
and trust will be the keys to progress. More than three-quarters 
of organizations (78 percent) are concerned that many users see 
AI as a ‘black box’. Almost as many (77 percent) expect AI to pose 
challenges to their current operational structures, potentially leading 
to job reduction and ethical concerns. 
Managing employee anxiety around change will be critical to AI 
adoption at speed. Those who navigate the evolving tech landscape 
with a focus on employee empowerment, and bringing everyone on 
board, will flourish amid rapid change. Organizations believe their 
workforce has an appetite for cutting-edge tech. But there is also 
fear that some individuals feel left behind by the rapidly evolving 
tech landscape. 
In an era where AI’s rapid evolution and adoption are reshaping the 
competitive landscape, tech execs need to rethink their strategic 
leadership roles. Three-quarters (76 percent) of tech execs surveyed 
feel that their role has evolved significantly over the past two 
years as the nature of tech and the workforce itself is changing. 
Tech execs must manage board level expectations during a period 
of hype cycles and cost sensitivity. At the same time, they must 
balance this against the need for a stable, coherent environment 
in which the workforce can harness AI, rather than stifling it. Tech 
execs play a critical role in steering their organizations through 
uncertain times, acting as a strategic innovator, adaptive pioneer, 
trend navigator and risk guardian. 
To find out more about the use cases for AI across the enterprise, visit our website.
Importantly, there are ways to address such concerns. KPMG’s 
Trusted AI1 framework, for example, emphasizes 10 pillars upon 
which to design, build, deploy and use AI solutions in an ethical 
manner. They include priorities such as fairness, sustainability, 
privacy, security and accountability.

Which of the following best describe how your company is 
experimenting with potential AI use cases?
Rather than a stringent centralized approach, organizations are 
adopting a more inclusive mindset around AI experimentation, 
crowdsourcing use cases from their workforces. The most popular 
approach is open collaboration, where diverse working groups 
conduct controlled experiments, sometimes supported by AI centers 
of excellence (CoEs) with representatives from every department. 
This approach is prioritized by organizations at the most mature level 
of AI implementation. Only 6 percent of organizations subscribe to 
a top-down approach to AI experimentation with heavy constraints 
around AI use from the outset. 
While initially encouraging democratized experimentation, many 
respondents (40 percent) plan a shift to a more centralized approach 
once they reach a critical mass of ideas that require stricter 
management to control risk and reduce duplication. In doing so, 
organizations should apply a balanced approach and steer away from 
overly stringent approval processes to avoid stifling innovation. One 
way of balancing speed with risk is driving alignment through cross-
functional CoEs or user groups, and only centrally managing AI 
initiatives that those groups identify as high-risk or high complexity. 
Regardless of their chosen experimentation approach, organizations 
have the opportunity to consolidate underlying processing and data 
infrastructure leading to gains in efficiency, reduced technical debt 
and a more effective end solution.
A systematic approach is key to prioritizing AI 
investment in alignment with business goals
To ensure the use cases with the greatest potential receive the 
attention and cross-functional support they require, there must be a 
strong roadmap to scaling and a clear link to business value. Many 
organizations are chasing short-term value by implementing AI tools 
in discrete parts of the value chain — that is, identifying specific use 
cases for deployment — where they see potential to solve problems 
or drive value. This is an understandable approach, but they must be 
careful not to create a tangle of initiatives that become increasingly 
difficult to track and compare.
Tracking expenditure and return on poorly integrated initiatives is even 
more pressing, given organizations expect to increase investment in 
AI over the next 12 months. Their top short-term goals for AI over the 
next year are to drive increased operational efficiency via automation, 
improve product and service development and innovation, and 
enhance pattern detection and issue correction. 
Data outlining customer behavior and feedback can help organizations 
understand where to apply AI for maximum effect. Salesforce’s 
Sumner raises the example of insurance, where automating contact 
points with customers worked well until policyholders wanted to 
notify their insurer of a loss. “Insurers were never able to get more 
than 10 percent of customers to do that online. They realized people 
were looking for human empathy.” This example shows how truly 
listening to customers can guide to the right path for delivering real 
value, and it’s a reminder that AI should be a tool or collaborator for 
human workers, rather than a replacement. 
Organizations should move away from disjointed AI use cases, and 
adopt a portfolio approach towards AI, focus on maximizing ROI while 
balancing innovation with risk mitigation.
Success that outlasts the hype will require 
consensus across the enterprise
The biggest barrier facing many organizations is moving from 
experimentation to production, says Naveen Zutshi, from Databricks. 
In scaling up an AI use case from a PoC to a more widespread 
production-level organizational practice, “the bottleneck is the 
confidence in the reliability, quality and safety of those AI models,” 
Zutshi says. “That comes back to data quality. You need to understand 
how the data is flowing: do you have sovereignty rights over the data, 
are you doing the right masking and encryption, and how are you 
looking at access controls right down to row and column level?”

Generative AI is introducing a brand-new risk vector to the tech 
domain, such as ‘hallucinations’, ‘jailbreaks’ and ‘adversarial 
prompting’ that can manipulate AI. The unexpected consequences 
of generated content have appeared seemingly frequently in 
the news this year. In light of this, when scaling emerging tech, 
organizations will need to have the governance and processes in 
place to control emerging risks. Survey respondents highlight the 
importance of continually developing AI governance policies for 
ethical and fair use in line with the evolving regulatory landscape. 
The process of establishing trusted guardrails and controls requires 
a multi-lens end-to-end secure approach to designing, building and 
deployment that incorporates coding best practice, code reviews, 
staff training and red teaming exercises that test the performance 
and reliability of AI models.
The ongoing AI hype may tempt organizations to make hurried 
decisions. However, successful AI adoption requires an enterprise-
wide multidisciplinary effort and a clear alignment across the 
enterprise, and a shared understanding of AI’s role and its potential. 
Organizations that can clearly define and communicate the value of AI 
to all stakeholders within the context of their business objectives, and 
execute through thoughtful collaboration, will have a greater chance of 
maximizing its impact across the enterprise.
As organizations embark on their AI transformation journeys, tech execs are at the forefront of navigating this complex and evolving 
landscape. In order to go beyond the hype and harness the potential of AI while balancing speed, risk, and value, they should focus on 
five key areas: 
Delivering value from AI: 
By aligning AI initiatives with overall business strategy, setting expectations for ROI, and allocating budget to AI transformation.
Unlocking AI capability: 
By upskilling teams to work with AI, setting up organizational governance structures, and identifying capabilities required 
across the business.
Building trust in AI: 
By identifying and addressing risks associated with AI, ensuring data quality and integrity, managing shadow AI and securing 
sensitive data used in AI.
Scaling AI with confidence: 
By deciding whether to build or buy AI capabilities, identifying suitable partners and vendors, and focusing on interoperability 
with existing IT infrastructure.
Architecting AI transformation: 
By engaging with the business and its various leaders to plan AI rollouts by value stream, function, or product, establishing an 
adoption roadmap, and integrating AI into existing business, digital, and tech strategies.

Conclusion and key recommendations
While the pace of digital transformation can 
be daunting, our research shows that many 
organizations are taking considerable strides 
forward in their implementation journeys, 
especially with AI, XaaS and cybersecurity.
The additional profitability that transformation has yielded so far is certainly 
encouraging and organizations are seeking value beyond profits. Execs are 
calibrating their digital transformation formulas to supercharge progress 
across a range of strategic objectives, including ESG responsibilities and 
customer experience elevation.
This year’s findings reveal that primary evidence, such as PoC tests and ROI, 
is taking precedence over a herd mentality. This empirical ethos will be integral 
to securing value and making wise choices, especially as tech execs try to 
balance the maintenance of legacy systems with a focus on new technology. 
To help guard against stakeholder skepticism associated with the safety and 
viability of new digital transformation opportunities, organizations should also 
bring structure, discipline and an enterprise mindset to the adoption of new 
technology, to mitigate risks and optimize value realization. 
The tech execs who make the superior decisions, safely steering their 
organization through various headwinds and risks, will be those that stay 
firmly rooted in a data-centric and value-led approach. These transformers 
will draw on both real-time and predictive data insights from a broad range 
of sources to make balanced judgment calls that align to the broader 
business and tech strategies, to drive sustainable value. 
Organizations that consistently 
demonstrate these behaviors 
can outpace their competition 
and unlock the potential of 
their technology investments, 
securing and growing market 
share as they do so.

Our respondents demonstrate that AI is already living up to the hype, with the majority of executives confirming they have already achieved business value from AI systems. To maintain momentum, organizations 
should reinforce their data management foundations. As AI PoC experiments are scaled up to production level, data integrity and reliability among other criteria, will dictate whether these innovations result in 
breakthroughs or costly setbacks. 
The attitudes and behaviors of high-performing organizations in this report provide many clues as to how to secure value from tech innovation.
Harness the 
power of 
partnership 
Resist being 
hypnotized by 
FOMO 
While a desire to 
progress and outpace 
your competition is 
healthy, do not let this 
boil over and distort your 
judgment. Rather than 
blindly following the herd, 
anchor decisions in your 
organization’s strategic 
objectives and look for 
tangible primary evidence 
of the right path to take.
Be empirical about 
deﬁning and 
delivering value 
Align stakeholders around a 
clear deﬁnition of success 
that cascades into a set of 
tangible metrics. Adopt an 
“always-on” approach to 
performance management 
and continuously monitor and 
adjust metrics in accordance 
with internal and external 
changes. These steps will help 
the organization to conﬁdently 
make decisions and deliver 
the value promised.
Mitigate 
technical debt
Embrace structured 
technical debt 
management. Establish 
clear remediation plans 
and robust architecture 
principles to contain and 
rationalize the technology 
landscape.
Innovation is not 
restricted to new 
technology. Explore new 
ways to collaborate, 
co-invest and share 
risk with your chosen 
partners. Use their 
networks to gain access 
to the latest technology 
and inventive ideas from 
around the globe.
Prioritize trust 
and security 
Ensure solutions are 
secure by design and 
embed trust and security 
assurance from the 
outset. Design, build, 
deploy and use AI and 
emerging tech solutions 
in a responsible and 
ethical manner so 
your organization can 
accelerate value with 
conﬁdence.
Build a strong 
data backbone 
Establish a robust data 
management framework 
that combines data, people, 
processes and policies 
to ensure information 
is reliable, relevant and 
appropriately used. Drive 
a shared understanding 
across the organization 
of how to harness data 
more effectively to support 
rapid and informed 
decision-making.
Develop AI 
proﬁciencies through
knowledge sharing
Test your workforce 
competence and 
sentiment on AI, and 
use this to determine 
the best way to bridge 
knowledge gaps, 
facilitate continuous 
learning and encourage 
cross-functional 
collaboration.

tech report 2024 2024 copyright owned by one or more of the kpmg international entities kpmg international entities provide no services to clients all rights reserved foreword a key theme from this years research is the perception among tech executives that they are struggling to keep up with the pace of change in response to this sense of falling behind organizations may be tempted to make a hurried response however this can lead to misguided investments that may prove both risky and expensive potentially increasing the burden of technical debt which many wellestablished organizations are already struggling with our research suggests that organizations are increasingly aware of this dilemma and they are looking to pivot from imitating others to becoming leaders themselves typically technology leaders are paving the way by bringing structure discipline and an enterprise mindset to the adoption of new technology in doing so they are looking to evidencebased investment decisions that align to the broader business and technology strategies and balance value creation with appetite for risk overall the sense from our respondents is that organizations are doing well with measurable improvement in many areas over the past year mistakes provide great learning opportunities for the future and the positive perspective on progress shared by our survey participants is encouraging 2450 technology professionals worldwide from a variety of industries the relentless speed of technology innovation is undeniable when combined with a natural fear of missing out ideas that may once have seemed like science fiction are rapidly converting into tangible reality from generative ai to quantum computing the potential benefits are huge and so is the risk of making costly mistakes by taking a measured approach to technology investment executives are already benefiting from key advancements while keeping a firm hold on their business models and successfully running the enterprise a willingness to enter the realm of science fiction does not mean leaving the facts of sound business management behind guy holland is the global leader of kpmgs cio center of excellence a

strategic approach to investment rapid change is driving fear of missing out fomo our research shows that the rapidly accelerated technology innovation over the past year has amplified a strong sense of fomo among organizations the flood of airelated news entering the mainstream has stirred a collective interest in ai that transcends seniority and technical expertise this has only served to stoke the fires of techenvy and could encourage a spend now ask questions later attitude digital transformation can bring many exciting benefits and ambition to progress is only healthy but organizations must not let it distort their judgement progress paranoia could lead to misguided investments and disjointed implementation initiatives despite fomo organizations are taking a more balanced approach to investment decisions while execs continue to look at the trends set by their market peers for guidance this year sees more of them basing investment decisions on their own primary evidence this

legacy systems can compromise new tech investments the desire to accelerate transformation appears to be favored 74 percent of organizations say that over the next 12 months they plan to focus on investing in new tech rather than on enhancing the value of their existing tech suite there is a risk that the allure of new technologies distracts organizations from addressing flaws and technical debt in their existing systems this approach can in turn undermine transformation progress often unresolved issues in current tech infrastructure can obstruct the implementation of emerging tech in fact unaddressed tech debt blocking the path to new upgrades is one of the top challenges holding back the digital transformation progress of the studys digital transformation high performers further 57 percent of organizations overall say that flaws in their foundational enterprise it systems disrupt businessasusual on a weekly basis the longer you delay addressing tech debt the higher the costs and risks become says commonwealth bank of australias gavin munroe continuous investment is crucial accumulated tech debt often results in embedded business rules and logic which can make future replacements costly and complex so its essential to consistently invest in unraveling tech debt to avoid escalating surprise costs and complexity over time organizations must strike a healthy balance between new and existing tech investments executives intentions to prioritize xaas investments will help here by replacing outdated systems and consolidating multiple functions into centralized hubs xaas platforms can reduce the complexity of infrastructures and the volume of redundant tech less likely to be gripped by fomo in comparison to nonleaders our leader group is 23 percentage points less likely to worry about keeping up with the pace of change also they are five percentage points less likely than the mainstream group to be choosing technologies because their competitors have already done so iteratively coursecorrecting highperforming organizations are adopting a more proactive and adaptive approach to evaluating tech investments as many as 83 percent of leaders continuously evaluate the business value and outcomes of all tech investments which is 17 percentage points higher than nonleaders this alwayson approach will provide organizations with more opportunity to intervene and optimize where required utilizing primary empirical evidence leaders are 21 percentage points more likely than nonleaders to run calculations to forecast the potential value of tech initiative before they invest leaning on external sources of expertise to enhance their digital transformation decisionmaking 93 percent of our leader group plan to expand and strengthen their ecosystem and partnerships compared with 70 percent of the mainstream sample aware of tech debt in contrast with nonleaders leading organizations place unaddressed tech debt as one of the top

conclusion and key recommendations foreword optimizing value through evidencebased decisions when measuring the effectiveness of digital transformation or the adoption of a certain piece of tech its important not to get fixated on just one metric you have to think about the implications a metric may have on other metrics and adjust your approach accordingly naveen zutshi cio databricks on balance organizations are content with the outcomes of their digital transformation investments mostly thanks to their ability to make sound decisions along the journey with the pace of change pressuring tech execs organizations must ensure haste does not compromise the quality of their judgment calls investing for the long term is still a good discipline to follow with execs fearing that their organizations are struggling to keep up with the pace of change planning for the long term can be difficult when balancing the needs of the latest technological advancements to maximize progress tech execs should channel digital transformation efforts towards what matters most strategically to their organizations where weve seen organizations achieving the most value from tech is where they step away from the habit of just following a tech trend for the sake of it says michelle chang cfocvp of microsoft customer and partner solutions and instead start with what is our business trying to accomplish whats our purpose and what problems are blocking us from achieving our purpose the answers to these questions will indicate how tech can help them move forward in a meaningful way our studys top performers get this with 53 percent strategically evaluating their tech investment portfolio to ensure it is aligned with their longterm goals compared with 41 percent of other organizations the good news is that most execs want to imbue their tech initiatives to provide value in nontech areas 70 percent ensure that their tech investments directly target their sustainability and social responsibilities executives understand that the value of tech goes beyond financial gain one of the lessons weve learnt is that tech initiatives cannot just be anchored in financial roi

require support from tech they need to deliver and measure value for the executives in our research the three most popular ways of measuring value are in general data maturity has increased with over half of respondents 52 percent on average now at one of the two highest levels of data proficiency the influentialembedded stages up from 40 percent in 2023 cloud platforms play a key role in enhancing proficiency in this area better data management and integration is the most commonly identified gain from increased use of xaas tech organizations can do much more with customer feedback according to our execs directing tech investments towards the service pain points flagged by customers and employees is the most influential tactic for generating quick wins from it investments for instance process points that have multiple handoffs between stakeholders and multiple systems of record with complex contracts can often be riddled with humanerror related execution issues resulting in delays for customers as an example using data mining to identify opportunities to employ smart contracts supported by blockchain or tokenization can target these pain points to speed up processing times and reduce the need for intervention from intermediaries while ensuring strong transparency and security levels look at your major business processes and ask where are inefficiencies dragging you down and keeping your organization from achieving its purpose says microsofts chang these are the points where technology is likely to be uniquely helpful however customer insights tend to be wasted 78 percent of execs say their business fails to use customer feedback effectively perhaps this is because organizations are struggling to decide on the required action to address the user feedback or there may be communication issues between front and back office ultimately unless organizations get better at using customer insights tech execs risk wasting their investments on lowvalue areas business growth metrics such as number of new products launched financial metrics such as costtoserve and profitability customercentric metrics such as customer satisfaction and customer base growth 78 of execs say their business fails to use customer feedback effectively 16 kpmg global tech report 2024 2024 copyright owned by one or more of the kpmg international entities kpmg

foreword optimizing value through evidencebased decisions what do the high performers do which behaviors set leading organizations apart when it comes to defining and delivering value our research suggests they are more likely to developing databacked measurements tailored to the business helps organizations establish cause and effect when they choose and implement tech predictive modeling capabilities when used alongside these metrics can advance the value creation journey by enabling proactive decisionmaking forecasting demand and internal performance changes identifying growth and cost optimization opportunities and mitigating potential risks metrics forecasts are a helpful reference point for tracking investment performance enabling informed course correction where required for instance 73 percent of execs say they perform accurate cost forecasts in their digital transformation projects it also follows that the majority 67 percent manage to prevent hidden costs from disrupting their digital transformation journeys but our leading organizations go further compared with other organizations the top performers are more likely to use both qualitative and quantitative metrics to establish causal trends and are more likely to use realtime data to guide decisionmaking by continuously monitoring performance organizations spot where to adjust in response to internal and external influences as such the high performers in the research are 10 percentage points more likely than the mainstream group to regularly review and update their valuetracking metrics to stay aligned with market changes make valuedriven decisions aligned with their longterm goals leaders are dedicated to ensuring their daily decisions contribute to longterm strategic goals and organizational definitions of success over half 53 percent of leading organizations strategically evaluate their tech investment portfolio to ensure it aligns with their longterm goals 12 percentage

have strong alignment across the organization for instance 90 percent of leaders can efficiently achieve consensus between stakeholders whereas other organizations are 18 percentage points less likely to be able to do so adopt an alwayson approach to performance management leading organizations continually develop the quality and breadth of the inputs that are informing their decisions for instance leaders are more likely to regularly review and update their valuetracking metrics as the market changes and use qualitative and quantitative insights to assess their digital transformation plans master the balance between acting as a risk guardian and a transformation accelerator leading organizations rank risk and cybersecurity metrics as most important for evaluating tech investments 87 percent are confident in their ability to measure this type of value compared with just 66 percent of other organizations also these leaders are 21 percentage points more likely to ensure their

delivering resilient solutions data proficiency should be a core competency for the organization while organizations are investing in data accessibility research indicates that only 24 percent are focusing on nurturing a datacentric culture and ensuring data interoperability in the near term this oversight presents a substantial barrier to fully harnessing technologys potential and undermines the ability to effectively use and understand data across all levels of the organization in a landscape increasingly dominated by data its crucial that organizations break down these silos and cultivate a deep enterprisewide appreciation of data strategy by doing so they can accelerate digital transformation towards success by optimizing processes and dynamically enhancing their products and services to meet customers evolving needs for sustainable innovation execs need to prioritize trust and security execs must ensure that pace of innovation is sustainable secure and that they can communicate value to stakeholders the high performers in our research rate risk and cybersecurity metrics including reduced frequency of cybersecurity incidents improved compliance and lower failure rates as the most important lenses through which to evaluate tech they are also more likely to be confident that they can track their performance in these areas this securityled stance of the leader group underlines the wider importance of trust and how to pursue it overall for the executives surveyed cybersecurity and privacy are the biggest concerns for achieving a successful digital transformation they also maintain that the top skill organizations need to thrive in a digital economy is the ability to ensure such considerations are front and center of business and tech priorities of the organization 72 percent of organizations are embracing a securebydesign mindset by involving and empowering cybersecurity teams in the early stages of tech investment projects in fact cybersecurity and privacy can enable organizations to pursue their business objectives securely and confidently and embrace new opportunities organizations need to learn from our high performers group and do more to evaluate tech investments against risk and cybersecurity factors for this to be comprehensive cybersecurity experts need a seat at the table from the outset so they can advise on how security can be embedded to build resilience and trust in doing so cybersecurity and privacy can support the organization as a trust enhancer and protector of brand reputation by minimizing the need for costly retrofitting of security fixes and the risk of data breaches for many organizations there is a disconnect between intentions and reality regarding the securityrelated habits of their workforces almost 8 in 10 78 percent respondents overall say that their staff training treats cybersecurity as a boxticking exercise and it is not embedded as required rather than rely exclusively on formal training sessions organizations should focus on implementing controls and operational features that make cybersecurity easy for employees to embrace in their daily work for instance strategies such as automating devsecops processes or providing access to password manager platforms can promote more secure employee behaviors michael wagner ciso at kenvue agrees that cybersecurity and resilience must be at the forefront of daily tech usage this includes maintaining business continuity plans having a retainer with an incident response firm testing backups and conducting regular recovery exercises incident exercises where different scenarios are presented are vital so that we can be prepared should the worst occur says wagner for instance the crowdstrike patch update issue in july 2024 caused widespread it outages around the globe the wider picture here is that tech innovation is not the enemy of risk management rather they should reinforce each other by starting with a clear definition of success that is rooted in their organizations purpose tech execs will be able to direct tech initiatives towards areas that will bring meaningful value an insightled approach will enable execs to prioritize and make decisions when it comes to delivering value polly sumner chief adoption officer salesforce when data is embedded and people are empowered tools like ai are adopted

two priority to ensure data system investments align with the priorities of key business stakeholders whereas other organizations place this outside of their top three focus areas perform routine datahygiene audits eighty percent of leaders conduct routine data hygiene audits to address gaps in data integrity and create data ownership frameworks other organizations are 31 percentage points less likely to have this as a fundamental part of their strategies use data and internal knowledge sharing to respond to market risks leaders say datacentric decisionmaking 61 percent and internal knowledge sharing 48 percent enable them to adjust their digital transformation strategies in response to evolving market risks compared with 43 and 38 percent respectively of nonleaders while data insights can sharpen risk resilience internal knowledge sharing is crucial by educating employees and keeping them informed of developments organizations will empower them to adapt and contribute to positive change prioritize data security leaders are 9 percentage points more likely than nonleaders to cite security as a key area of focus for improvement over the next 12 months what do the high performers do how are the highperforming organizations strengthening their data backbones and using data as an asset to deliver secure digital transformation outcomes our research suggests these organizations are more likely to involve security teams from the outset executives maintain that cybersecurity and privacy are the biggest concerns for achieving a successful digital transformation but when it comes to security moving at a measured pace is important involving cybersecurity and information governance teams from the outset of digital transformation initiatives will help minimize delays and enable businesses to progress investments confidently to reduce securityrelated downtime battle test your organizations threat response reflexes kenvues wagner suggests that business continuity plans having a retainer with an incident response firm backups testing and regular recovery exercises will prove vital here challenge risk aversion by articulating the costs of inaction a high 80 percent of executives say that a risk averse attitude leads senior leadership to respond to market forces more slowly than competitors when faced with a scenario where risk aversion is influencing senior leadership towards gridlock one helpful tactic to kickstart movement is to evaluate the risks of inaction against the change being considered for instance losing market share to competitors because of a failure to adapt your product offering if analysis reveals that the threats associated with staying idle are too concerning to ignore this can stimulate forward momentum and creative thinking to tackle challenges and manage the risks that come with embracing the change accelerate progress by removing governance bottlenecks poor governance and coordination appear in the top three toughest challenges that derail transformation progress for instance 58 percent say their centralized decisionmaking reduces their organizations ability to respond to market signals and embrace new tech while 57 percent say that friction and communication breakdowns occur frequently between teams at times of high workload 01 02 03 how to overcome threats to digital transformation executives are keen to speed up their tech progress but to do so reliably effective risk management is essential consider the following tactics to manage the most common threats to digital

positive that 74 percent of respondents say ai is already increasing the productivity of their knowledge workers improving their organizations overall performance furthermore just over 8 in 10 respondents expect automation efforts to shift the focus of knowledge workers towards more creative roles and that ai will even redefine the future of knowledge itself however ai is also fueling anxiety in the workforce consensus and trust will be the keys to progress more than threequarters of organizations 78 percent are concerned that many users see ai as a black box almost as many 77 percent expect ai to pose challenges to their current operational structures potentially leading to job reduction and ethical concerns managing employee anxiety around change will be critical to ai adoption at speed those who navigate the evolving tech landscape with a focus on employee empowerment and bringing everyone on board will flourish amid rapid change organizations believe their

reshaping the competitive landscape tech execs need to rethink their strategic leadership roles threequarters 76 percent of tech execs surveyed feel that their role has evolved significantly over the past two years as the nature of tech and the workforce itself is changing tech execs must manage board level expectations during a period of hype cycles and cost sensitivity at the same time they must

investing in ai we have invested strategically in core business capabilities and have ai use cases running actively across the organization that are returning business value testing ai we have a large number of ai proofofconcept tests running but havent achieved roi yet we have a limited number of ad hoc use cases in production early stage we have a small number of ai proofofconcept experiments not started we havent implemented any ai yet but plan to at some point in the future notably organizations in certain countries including china the us the uk germany israel and saudi arabia are most likely to have mature ai investments already generating value at sector level industrial manufacturing life sciences and healthcare appear to be leading of respondents say ai is already increasing the productivity of their knowledge workers improving their organizations overall performance most organizations are now seeing some return on ai but value at scale remains more elusive ai adoption is gathering speed and so is the rate of return three out of four organizations this year are already generating value from ai however only 31 percent of all organizations achieve this at scale given the expanding range of potential use cases for ai its essential to establish a strategy aligned with business goals adopt a portfolio approach to explore a range of opportunities simultaneously make

we have guardrails and ai risk training in place and we encourage our workforce to experiment within those boundaries more democratized more centralized 34 40 open collaboration we have controlled groups of experimentation or ai centers of excellence featuring employees from every department across our business selective collaboration our dedicated ai team invites consultation from employees in different departments and decides on which ones to pursue topdown experimentation we have heavy constraints around ai use authorized ai use cases are being rolled out by our aiit team and employees are prohibited from using ai for anything else we are not experimenting with ai yet 19 6 1 which of the following best describe how your company is experimenting with potential ai use cases rather than a stringent centralized approach organizations are adopting a more inclusive mindset around ai experimentation crowdsourcing use cases from their workforces the most popular approach is open collaboration where diverse working groups conduct controlled experiments sometimes supported by ai centers of excellence coes with representatives from every department this approach is prioritized by organizations at the most mature level of ai implementation only 6 percent of organizations subscribe to a topdown approach to ai experimentation with heavy constraints around ai use from the outset while initially encouraging democratized experimentation many respondents 40 percent plan a shift to a more centralized approach once they reach a critical mass of ideas that require stricter management to control risk and reduce duplication in doing so organizations should apply a balanced approach and steer away from overly stringent approval processes to avoid stifling innovation one way of balancing speed with risk is driving alignment through cross functional coes or user groups and only centrally managing ai initiatives that those groups identify as highrisk or high complexity regardless of their chosen experimentation approach organizations have the opportunity to consolidate underlying processing and data infrastructure leading to gains in efficiency reduced technical debt and a more effective end solution a systematic approach is key to prioritizing ai investment in alignment with business goals to ensure the use cases with the greatest potential receive the attention and crossfunctional support they require there must be a strong roadmap to scaling and a clear link to business value many organizations are chasing shortterm value by implementing ai tools in discrete parts of the value chain that is identifying specific use cases for deployment where they see potential to solve problems or drive value this is an understandable approach but they must be careful not to create a tangle of initiatives that become increasingly difficult to track and compare tracking expenditure and return on poorly integrated initiatives is even more pressing given organizations expect to increase investment in ai over the next 12 months their top shortterm goals for ai over the next year are to drive increased operational efficiency via automation improve product and service development and innovation and enhance pattern detection and issue correction data outlining customer behavior and feedback can help organizations understand where to apply ai for maximum effect salesforces sumner raises the example of insurance where automating contact points with customers worked well until policyholders wanted to notify their insurer of a loss insurers were never able to get more than 10 percent of customers to do that online they realized people were looking for human empathy this example shows how truly listening to customers can guide to the right path for delivering real value and its a reminder that ai should be a tool or collaborator for human workers rather than a replacement organizations should move away from disjointed ai use cases and adopt a portfolio approach towards ai focus on maximizing roi while balancing innovation with risk mitigation success that outlasts the hype will require consensus across the enterprise the biggest barrier facing many organizations is moving from experimentation to production says naveen zutshi from databricks in scaling up an ai use case from a poc to a more widespread productionlevel organizational practice the bottleneck is the confidence in the reliability quality and safety of those ai models zutshi says that comes back to data quality you need to understand how the data is flowing do you have sovereignty rights over the data are you doing the right masking and encryption and how are you looking at access controls right down to row and column level 25 kpmg global tech
