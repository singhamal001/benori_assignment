The KPMG Private Enterprise Tax report titled Carving a new path: How private companies can contribute to future economic stability strongly suggests that supporting the resilience, adaptability, innovation and long-term focus of privately owned companies is in everyone’s best interest.
This remains relevant today as governments across the world are looking for ways to raise money to reduce their post-pandemic debt and address the decline in tax revenues.

Should governments therefore target their efforts toward more tax incentives to stimulate growth versus introducing tax rate increases? Or is it important to achieve the right balance between a mix of taxation changes and incentives?

The tax and regulatory environment is constantly evolving and it’s important for private companies to understand the “what” and “why” of proposed tax changes and how they can impact their business.

CJEU rules that the Polish tax exemption limited to externally managed investment funds breaches EU law

CJEU – Poland – Free movement of capital – UCI – Investment funds – Externally managed funds – De facto discrimination – Exemption from corporate income tax – Conditions for exemption

On February 27, 2025, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU or the Court) gave its decision 
opens in a new tab
in case C-18/23. The case examined whether a Polish tax exemption, granted only to externally managed non-resident investment funds, is compatible with the free movement of capital under EU law.
Contrary to the opinion of Advocate General (AG) Kokott, the Court concluded that the Polish legislation under dispute is contrary to the free movement of capital.

Background

Under Polish rules, all domestic funds set up under Polish Law on investment funds are exempt for corporate income tax purposes. In addition, subject to certain conditions, the Polish Tax Code provides for a tax exemption with respect to Polish-generated income to open ended funds (UCITS) as well as other non-UCITS types of investment funds, including specialized funds and closed-ended funds, domiciled in an EU or EEA jurisdiction. One of the conditions is that the fund must be managed by entities authorized by the competent financial market supervisory authorities of the state where the managing entity is based (i.e., externally managed). It should be noted that, under Polish law, the establishment of internally managed investment funds is not permitted.
The plaintiff was a specialized investment fund incorporated in Luxembourg and authorized by the Financial Sector Supervisory Commission in Luxembourg. The Fund was managed by its board of directors (i.e., internally managed). The board of directors was authorized by the competent Luxembourg supervisory authority, was registered as an alternative investment fund manager, and was also included in the list of managers.
The plaintiff applied for an advance tax ruling from the Director of the National Tax Information Office in Poland, claiming that the income generated in Poland should benefit from the exemption mentioned above. The Polish tax authorities refused to issue the advance tax ruling, arguing that only externally managed investment funds could benefit from the tax exemption, and that the plaintiff’s management did not meet this requirement. Following legal proceedings initiated by the plaintiff, the Regional Administrative Court expressed doubts about the compatibility of the Polish law with the EU fundamental freedoms and referred the case to the CJEU.
On July 11, 2024, AG Kokott recommended that the CJEU finds the Polish tax exemption for externally managed investment funds compatible with EU law arguing that there is no restriction of the free movement of capital. The AG ruled out the existence of direct discrimination, as the tax exemption under dispute applies regardless of the domicile of the investment fund. The AG also concluded that the rules at hand do not result in indirect discrimination, citing, amongst other reasons, the lack of discriminatory effect of the criterion of differentiation chosen by Poland and the autonomy of Member States in taxing investment funds.
The AG also explored an alternative line of reasoning whereby the CJEU finds that the disputed measure does lead to indirect discrimination of internally managed funds. Under this scenario, the AG argued that investment funds set up in Poland and internally managed investment funds set up abroad are not in an objectively comparable situation. The AG reached this conclusion on the ground that the rules aim to protect investors, and – in the AG’s view, only externally managed investment funds can adequately ensure the separation of investment assets from the management company’s assets.
In a third line of reasoning, assuming the CJEU considers the two types of investment funds to be in an objectively comparable situation, the AG held that the difference in treatment could be justified by an overriding reason in the public interest, i.e., effective investor protection, and that the measure would be proportionate. For more details on the AG opinion, please refer to E-News Issue 199.

The CJEU Decision

Potential restriction on the free movement of capital
The Court recalled that a different treatment of resident and non-resident funds could be permitted under the free movement of capital if it relates to situations that are not objectively comparable or where the restriction can be justified by an overriding reason relating to the public interest.
The CJEU noted that the disputed rules do not represent direct discrimination, as the tax exemption was not denied based on the residence of the fund, but on the basis of its management form. However, the rules could still de facto place cross-border situations at a disadvantage (indirect discrimination). The CJEU recalled its settled case-law according to which indirect discrimination may occur when the tax advantage is linked to conditions or obligations specific to the national market, in such a way that only resident operators are able to meet them, whilst comparable non-resident operators cannot generally comply with such requirements.
Since EU law in this area is not harmonised, the Court acknowledged that Member States remain free to determine the management form applicable to investment funds set up within their territory and are also free to define the material and formal conditions which must be respected by funds to benefit from specific tax regimes. However, the Court noted that a Member State cannot impose conditions denying income tax advantages on investments made in that Member State by non-resident investment funds, which have adopted a management form authorized by the legislation of their home Member State and which operate in accordance with that legislation, solely on the ground that their management form does not correspond to the management form required for resident investment funds.
In light of the above, the CJEU therefore found that the Polish legislation leads to a restriction that is liable to deter non-resident investment funds from making Polish investments. The disputed Polish legislation therefore breaches the free movement of capital.
Comparability of the cross-border situation with the internal situation
As regards the comparability analysis, the CJEU reiterated its settled case law according to which the comparability of a cross-border situation with a domestic situation should be assessed based on the objective pursued by the national legislation at stake and the purpose and content of the relevant provisions. Furthermore, only the relevant distinguishing criteria included in the national legislation should be taken into account when assessing whether there is a different tax treatment related to a situation that is objectively comparable.
The CJEU noted that the referring court did not describe the objective pursed by the Polish tax exemption granted to funds managed externally and that it is up to the referring court to interpret such objective. Under the assumption that the referring court would find that the exemption is intended to avoid double taxation of income (both at the investment fund level and at the investor level), such an objective may be achieved irrespective of the management form of the investment vehicle. Therefore, this would not place internally management funds in a different situation from externally managed funds. Furthermore, whilst the different levels of investment risk associated with funds managed externally or internally could explain the design of local requirements for setting-up an investment fund in Poland, in the Court’s view such considerations are not capable of demonstrating differences in their situation with respect to the corporation tax exemption. 
In light of the above, the CJEU held that externally managed investment funds domiciled in Poland and internally managed investment funds domiciled abroad are in an objectively comparable situation.
Potential overriding reason in the public interest
Lastly, the Court rejected both justifications put forward by the Polish government, namely:
The protection of investors. The Polish government had argued that the condition related to the external management form is intended to protect the interests of investors. In the Polish’s government view, the conditions seek to separate the capital of investors grouped together in the investment fund from the assets of the management company and thus, to separate investment risks from those associated with the creation and the management of the investment fund. The CJEU recalled its settled case-law according to which the protection of investors may, in principle, constitute an overriding reason in the public interest, capable of justifying a restriction on the free movement of capital. The Court then noted that the disputed Polish tax exemption includes additional conditions that already ensure that activity of non-resident funds is supervised by the financial market supervisory authorities of their home country. Furthermore, the CJEU noted that the Polish government failed to explain how granting the exemption to internally managed funds would jeopardize the objective of protecting investors. Moreover, in the Court’s view, whilst favorable tax treatment for externally managed funds could encourage their use, offering less favorable treatment to internally managed funds does not automatically protect investors. Therefore, the CJEU concluded that such a tax measure is not suitable for achieving the objective of investor protection1, particularly when the foreign funds are supervised by the financial authorities of their home country.
The prevention of abuse. The Court noted that the Polish government failed to explain and establish a link between the management form of an investment fund and a possible risk of abuse.
The Court’s decision
In the light of all the foregoing considerations, the CJEU ruled that Article 63(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union establishing the EU free movement of capital precludes legislation of a Member State which grants a corporate tax exemption only to externally managed funds and denies the exemption to internally managed funds that are constituted in accordance with the legislation of another Member State.

ETC Comment

The CJEU’s judgment is significant for the Polish market and should enable internally managed foreign investment funds to reclaim withholding tax collected on income received from their Polish investments, provided all other relevant conditions are met.
Note that it may now be possible to reopen previously closed cases, provided, among others that a formal request is submitted based on the CJEU’s ruling in this case. The request must be filed with tax authorities within one month as from the date of the CJEU’s decision or with the administrative courts within three months from that date. The possibility of reopening closed cases should be assessed on a case by case basis, in light of applicable domestic regulations.

(This article was published on 29 September 2022 and updated on 27 February 2025)

Highlights

– Main areas of change
– Areas where differences remain
– Effective date – 1 January 2027

The third edition of the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard reflects updates that now largely align it with IFRS Accounting Standards. Some areas of divergence remain – the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) has notably opted to defer alignment with IFRS 16 Leases – but the updated SMEs Accounting Standard now broadly reflects:
IFRS 3 Business Combinations;
IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements;
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers; and
other relevant changes made to IFRS Accounting Standards since 2015.

Main areas of change

The IASB has made changes to all sections of the standard. However, many of these are editorial in nature. The following table summarises some of the more important updates.
Section  Changes made
Section 2 Concepts and Pervasive Principles
Revised to align with the 2018 Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting.
Section 9 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements
Changed to align with IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements, IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements and IFRS 12 Disclosures of Interests in Other Entities.
The changes include an amendment to the definition of control and new requirements relating to the loss of control of a subsidiary.
Section 11 Basic Financial Instruments and Section 12 Other Financial Instruments
These sections have been combined and renamed Section 11 Financial Instruments, and changes have been made to reflect the requirements of IFRS 9 (with appropriate simplifications and some exceptions).
The amendments include:
removing the option to apply the recognition and measurement requirements of IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement; and
introducing a supplementary principle for classifying debt instruments based on their contractual cash flow characteristics.
Section 12 Fair Value Measurement
A new section on measuring fair value and disclosing information about fair value measurements based on IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement.
Section 19 Business Combinations and Goodwill
Changed to reflect new requirements in IFRS 3 Business Combinations, including amendments:
to the definition of a business;
requiring application of the acquisition rather than the purchase method;
requiring initial and subsequent recognition of contingent consideration at fair value; and
adding requirements for a business combination achieved in stages.
Section 23 Revenue 
Revised to align with IFRS 15.
Introduces a new revenue recognition model, which is a simplified version of IFRS 15’s five-step model.
Transition relief allows companies to apply their current revenue recognition policy to contracts already in progress.
Section 28 Employee Benefits
Changed to require a more detailed reconciliation of the opening and closing balances of a defined benefit obligation, plan assets, and any recognised reimbursement rights.

Areas where differences remain

There are a number of topic areas in which the IASB has not made changes, including the following.
Standard/Topic           Reason for no change
IFRS 16 Leases            The IASB believes that aligning the SMEs Accounting Standard with IFRS 16 now will impose an undue burden on SMEs. It will reconsider its decision in the next comprehensive review of the SMEs Accounting Standard.
IFRS 14 Regulatory Deferral Accounts         IFRS 14 will be replaced when the IASB issues its forthcoming accounting standard, Regulatory Assets and Regulatory Liabilities. The IASB will consider whether to include requirements for regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities in a future review of the SMEs Accounting Standard.
Expected credit loss model for impairment of financial assets                                                     There is no alignment with IFRS 9’s expected credit loss (ECL) model for impairment of financial assets, because the IASB concluded that the model is not relevant for many companies in scope of the SMEs Accounting Standard. It received feedback suggesting that, for those SMEs holding only trade receivables, moving to an ECL model could involve substantial implementation costs. However, the IASB has amended Section 11 Financial Instruments to add a requirement for SMEs to disclose an analysis of financial assets by due date.

Effective date – 1 January 2027

The amended and revised sections of the SMEs Accounting Standard are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2027. Earlier application is permitted.

EU Clean Industrial Deal – Upcoming new State aid framework and recommendations on tax incentives

European Commission – Clean Industrial Deal – Tax incentives – State aid – 28th legal regime – Competitiveness – Draghi Report – Single Market

On February 26, 2025, the European Commission published its Communication on a Clean Industrial Deal providing for a joint roadmap for competitiveness and decarbonization in the EU.
From a direct tax perspective, key takeaways include:
Intention to issue recommendations for EU Member States to adopt tax incentives to support the Clean Industrial Deal, including shorter depreciation periods for certain technology assets and the use of tax credits for businesses in strategic sectors for the clean transition.
Proposal for a new Clean Industry State Aid Framework to be adopted by June 2025, which would build on the current Temporary Crisis and Transition Framework and outline, amongst others, conditions for tax incentives to be considered compliant from an EU State aid perspective when introduced as selective measures.

Background

Article 107 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU) generally prohibits advantages in any form conferred by national public authorities to undertakings on a selective basis (State aid1), unless exceptionally justified. One exception is provided under Article 107(3)(b) TFEU, which considers aid compatible with the internal market where it is intended to remedy a serious disturbance in the economy of a Member State (or across the EU economy).
In this context, on March 23, 2022, the European Commission (Commission or EC) adopted a Temporary Crisis Framework (TCF) allowing Member States to provide State aid to companies impacted by the conflict in Ukraine. The TCF set out temporary State aid measures that the EC considered compatible with the EU internal market and that can be approved rapidly upon notification by each Member State.
Following several amendments and prolongations, the TCF was replaced by the Temporary Crisis and Transition Framework (TCTF) on March 9, 2023, as part of the broader Green Deal Industrial Plan for the Net Zero Age. The TCTF expanded and further simplified the provisions for support to accelerate renewable energy deployment and industrial decarbonization. Under the TCTF, Member States are allowed to provide investment support for the manufacturing of strategic equipment (e.g., batteries, solar panels, wind turbines, heat-pumps, electrolyzers and carbon capture usage and storage) for the transition towards a net-zero economy. Amongst others, the support can be structured as direct grants or as tax advantages (e.g., tax credits), loans or guarantees subject to certain caps and limitations. For more information, please refer to Euro Tax Flash Issue 508 .
The sections of the TCTF covering support to accelerate renewable energy deployment, industrial decarbonization, and investments in key sectors for the transition to a net-zero economy are generally applicable until December 31, 2025. According to a Commission release
opens in a new tab
, around EUR 796 billion of aid was approved in the period March 2022 to June 2024 either under the TCTF or directly under the Treaty and based on TCTF principles. Around EUR 219 billion was actually granted to companies, representing 27 percent of the aid approved and corresponding to 0.5 percent of the EU GDP in 2022, 2023 and the first half of 2024. Examples of approved direct tax related measures under the TCTF include tax credits for investments supporting green transition in France (approved in January 2024) as well as in Finland (approved in February 2025) – see E-News Issue 189 and Issue 201 for more information.
As part of its 2025 work program, the Commission recently announced the intended release of the Clean Industrial Deal initiative aiming to boost industrial competitiveness while simultaneously supporting decarbonization. According to the work program, this would include the development of a new State aid Framework to accelerate the roll-out of renewable energy, strengthen industrial decarbonization and ensure sufficient manufacturing capacities for clean tech. The EC’s Competitiveness Compass also indicated - in the context of the Clean Industrial Deal - an intention to encourage Member States to adjust their tax systems to support private investment in clean technologies, including through depreciation rules and tax credits.
Building on Mario Draghi's report on Europe's future competitiveness (the Draghi Report), both the EC’s Competitiveness Compass Communication and 2025 work program further indicated the release of an ""Omnibus simplification package"" to reduce reporting burdens by 25 percent for all companies and 35 percent for SMEs, and a proposed ""28th legal regime"" which would allow innovative companies to operate across the EU under a single set of rules, simplifying corporate law, insolvency, labor law, and also taxation.
For more information on the EC 2025 work program and Competitiveness Compass, please refer to Euro Tax Flash Issue 555 and E-News Issue 206.

European Commission’s Clean Industrial Deal Communication

On February 26, 2025, the EC published
opens in a new tab
its Clean Industrial Deal Communication (the Communication), providing a comprehensive workplan for the development in the EU of a competitive, decarbonized industry.
According to the Communication, the EC aims to increase sustainable and resilient production in Europe by focusing on two interlinked sectors: support to energy-intensive industries to confront high energy costs, unfair global competition and complex regulations, harming their competitiveness; and support the clean-tech sector, which is seen as a key enabler of industrial transformation, competitiveness and decarbonization.
Overview of the Clean Industrial Deal
The Clean Industrial Deal comprises the following six building blocks:
Access to affordable energy: the Commission presented
opens in a new tab
on February 26, 2025 an Affordable Energy Action Plan proposing measures to lower energy bills in the short term, while accelerating the implementation of cost-saving structural reforms and strengthening the EU energy systems to mitigate future price shocks. As regards measures to lower energy bills, the Action Plan calls on the Council to complete the revision of the Energy Taxation Directive proposed in 2021. The Action Plans further recalls that the current Energy Taxation Directive allows Member States to decrease electricity taxation down to zero for energy intensive industries. Against that background, the Action Plan indicates the EC’s aim to issue a recommendation to Member States in the fourth quarter of 2025 on how to use such flexibilities and ensure across all sectors that electricity is taxed less than other energy sources while pursuing long-term decarbonization objectives.
Lead markets - boosting clean supply and demand: includes plans on using non-price criteria in public procurement and incentives for private purchases. According to the Communication, this will include the development of a voluntary label on the carbon intensity content of industrial products in the fourth quarters of 2025, which may be used by Member States to design tax incentives and other support schemes. This building block further focuses on measures to promote the uptake of renewable and low-carbon hydrogen.
Public and private investments: includes measures to strengthen EU-level funding, leverage private investment, and establish a new Clean Industry State Aid Framework in the second quarter of 2025, along with other forms of support. As explained in further detail in the next section, the Communication further indicates that the EC will provide recommendations for Member States to adopt tax incentives that support the Clean Industrial Deal and that are in line with State aid rules.
Powering the circular economy - a secure access to materials and resources: includes measures to secure access to critical raw materials and resources as well as measures to allow transformational steps towards a circular economy. In this context, the Communication indicates that the Commission will review the rules on the second-hand scheme contained in the VAT Directive as part of a broader green VAT initiative, indicated for the fourth quarter of 2026.
Global markets and international partnerships: includes a focus on establishing clean trade and investment partnerships and refining the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM). As regards CBAM, as part of a broader Sustainability Omnibus also published on February 26, 2025, the Commission published
opens in a new tab
a CBAM simplification package in the form of a proposal to amend the CBAM regulation aimed at simplifying processes for businesses and reducing the related administrative burden. According to the Communication, the EC further aims to present a comprehensive CBAM review report in the second half of 2025 and a legislative proposal on the extension of CBAM in the first quarter of 2026. This building block also aims at ensuring that foreign investments in the EU better contribute to the long-term competitiveness of EU industry, its technological edge and economic resilience, as well as the creation of quality jobs in the EU. According to the Communication, this will include the adoption of guidelines on key concept underpinning the Foreign Subsidies Regulation to assess the distortive effects of foreign subsidies. Guidelines on the Foreign Subsidies Regulation are scheduled to be published in the first quarter of 2026.
Skills and quality jobs for social fairness and a just transition: includes developing skills, creating quality jobs, supporting workers during transitions, and implementing social leasing for clean products to ensure a fair and equitable transition.
Recommendations for tax incentives
According to the Clean Industrial Deal Communication, corporate tax policies are considered to be a key measure to reach the objectives of the Clean Industrial Deal and should be designed in a way to support a clean business case (i.e., instead of disadvantaging clean energy compared to fossil fuels).
As such, the Commission intends to issue recommendations for Member States to adopt tax incentives to support the Clean Industrial Deal. According to the Communication, this may include:
shorter depreciation periods for certain technology assets, allowing businesses to quickly write off costs and benefit from tax incentives that offset high initial investments; and
the use of tax credits for businesses in strategic sectors for the clean transition, to make it more financially attractive to invest in decarbonized practices.
The Communication further notes that the EC intends to integrate such instruments in its compatibility rules under the new Clean Industry State Aid Framework. In addition, it is indicated that these tax related measures will be paired with further actions to scale down and phase out fossil fuel subsidies.
According to the EC Communication, the recommendations to Member States regarding tax incentives are scheduled to be issued in the second quarter of 2025.
New Clean Industry State Aid Framework
The Communication notes that the Commission’s proposal for a new Clean Industry State Aid Framework will be developed with a view to further accelerate the roll-out of renewable energy, to deploy industrial decarbonization, and to ensure sufficient manufacturing capacity of clean tech.
According to the EC Communication, the proposal will build on the TCTF adopted on March 9, 2023 and will allow separate support schemes for specific technologies such as wind and solar, and further facilitate support for additional manufacturing of clean-tech products, such as batteries and renewable technologies by updating the State aid rules for investments in certain strategic net-zero equipment manufacturing capacity. The EC release further notes that the Commission will also reflect on a further simplification of the State aid rules to prioritize work on the most distortive aid measures and accelerate authorizations of compatible aid.
According to the EC Communication, the Clean Industry State Aid Framework is scheduled to be adopted by June 2025.

ETC Comment

Whilst the EC’s work program 2025 suggested that there are currently no specific plans for the Commission to put forward new tax proposals in the form of Directives, direct tax measures remain an area of focus for the Commission as enablers to boost competitiveness and decarbonization.
As a result, taxpayers operating in the EU may want to monitor closely how individual Member States choose to make use of the EC recommendations to adopt tax incentives such as tax credits and shorter depreciation periods whilst respecting the upcoming new EU State aid guidelines.
Note that a number of European jurisdictions have already introduced new incentives or revised existing incentives in light of the implementation of Pillar Two. Other jurisdictions are still in the process of evaluating how to reform their existing incentives frameworks to ensure efficiency and mitigate an unfavorable impact on the effective tax rate under the GloBE rules. For more information on how countries may be incentivized to adjust their tax systems and on which legislative actions have already been taken or are being considered locally, please refer to KPMG’s dedicated article

Highlights

– Reducing the number of companies in scope
– Simplifying ESRS
– Limiting the scope and amending the content of the EU Taxonomy
– What other key changes are proposed?
– What’s next?

The European Commission has released an Omnibus package
opens in a new tab
of proposals to reduce sustainability reporting and due diligence requirements.
As part of this Omnibus package only the largest companies would report under European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS); a subset of those companies would continue to report under the EU Taxonomy. These changes would need to be approved by the European Parliament and the Council of the EU and transposed into national law to become effective.
Furthermore, the Commission announced that it will simplify ESRS disclosure requirements and is consulting to amend the EU Taxonomy.

Reducing the number of companies in scope

Under the proposals, only large1 companies with more than 1,000 employees would be in scope of the CSRD2  and therefore required to report under ESRS. The Commission estimates this would decrease the number of companies in scope by approximately 80 percent.
Further, under a so-called 'Stop the clock' proposal, mandatory ESRS reporting for second- and third-wave companies would be postponed for two years. This postponement will allow more time for the EU to agree substantive changes to the CSRD.
An overview of how the proposals would affect different companies is presented below.
  Under existing CSRD 'Stop the clock’ proposal  Substantive proposals
Large PIEs with > 1,000 employees
'Wave-one' reporting from FY24 under ESRS
Continue to report3 Report under revised ESRS
Large PIEs with 500– 1,000 employees Continue to report3 No longer required to report. Value chain information requests could not exceed what would be reported under an amended VSME
Large companies > 1,000 employees 
'Wave-two' reporting from FY25 under ESRS 
Report from FY27 Report under revised ESRS from FY27
Large companies with up to 1,000 employees Report from FY27 No longer required to report. Value chain information requests could not exceed what would be reported under an amended VSME
Listed SMEs 'Wave-three' reporting under LSME standard from FY26 with the option to opt out until FY28 Report from FY28 No longer required to report. Value chain information requests could not exceed what would be reported under an amended VSME
Non-EU parents
Reporting under ESRS for non-EU groups (NESRS) at group level from FY28 when the group has:
EUR 150m turnover generated in the EU, and at least one of:
in-scope EU subsidiary; or
EU branch with > EUR 40m turnover
Report from FY28 if they meet the criteria
Reporting under NESRS at group level from FY28 when the group has:
EUR 450m turnover generated in the EU, and at least one of:
large EU subsidiary; or
EU branch with > EUR 50m turnover

Simplifying ESRS

Alongside communicating its first Omnibus package, the Commission announced it intends to amend ESRS to substantially reduce the volume of disclosures – e.g. by prioritising quantitative datapoints over narrative text and clearly distinguishing between mandatory and voluntary datapoints. The concept of double materiality would remain, but the Commission intends to provide clearer instructions on applying the materiality principle.
Under the proposals, the Commission no longer plans to adopt sector-specific standards.

Limiting the scope and amending the content of the EU Taxonomy

The Commission proposes making the EU Taxonomy mandatory for only a subset of large companies – i.e. those with:
more than 1,000 employees; and
a net turnover of more than EUR 450 million.
In contrast, companies wanting to claim voluntarily that their activities are taxonomy-aligned would, as a minimum, need to disclose KPIs on turnover and capital expenditure.
Additionally, the Commission has called for feedback on proposals to simplify the EU Taxonomy, including introducing a materiality threshold, simplifying the ‘Do No Significant Harm’ criteria on pollution and revising the reporting templates. These changes would apply initially for FY25 for reporting in 2026.

What other key changes are proposed?

The Commission proposes changing the CSRD to protect smaller companies (up to 1,000 employees) by limiting the ‘trickle-down effect’. Requests for value chain information could not exceed what would be reported under an amended voluntary reporting standard for SMEs (VSME).
The CSRD would still require limited assurance, but the Commission no longer intends to move to reasonable assurance. In addition, the deadline for a European limited assurance standard would be removed.
On the CSDDD4, the Commission proposes significant changes to reduce the compliance burden on companies. The proposals include delaying initial application by one year, reducing the number of business partners and stakeholders to consider, and less frequent assessments.

What's next?

The Commission plans to announce further Omnibus proposals as part of its simplification agenda, for example, introducing a new small mid-cap category of companies later this year.
All of the above Omnibus proposals could be subject to change as they progress through the European Parliament, the Council of the EU and are transposed into national law. We’ll continue to monitor the developments – follow KPMG IFRS on LinkedIn for further updates.
Consider the impact of the above proposals on your business and have your say on the proposal to amend the delegated acts on the EU Taxonomy before 26 March 2025.

1 Large companies are those that, on the balance sheet date, meet two out of the following three criteria: 250 employees, net revenue of EUR 50 million, and EUR 25 million in total assets

3 Applies to companies in EU member states where CSRD has been transposed

Implementation of Basel 3.1: The PRA, in consultation with HM Treasury, has announced a delay to the UK implementation of Basel 3.1 by one year until 1 January 2027. This allows more time for greater clarity to emerge about plans for its implementation in the United States. Further updates will follow on the interactions between timelines for Basel 3.1 and the new regime for Small Domestic Deposit Takers (including the Interim Capital Regime). The delay now puts the UK even further behind the EU’s implementation, with most of the CRR requirements applying from 1 January 2025 and FRTB from 1 January 2026.
Supervisory priorities for UK Deposit Takers and International Banks: On 21 January, the PRA wrote to the CEOs of UK Deposit Takers
opens in a new tab
(UKDTs) and International Banks
opens in a new tab
outlining its supervisory priorities for 2025. The priorities are broadly consistent with those set out in 2024. Robust governance, risk management and controls are expected and there is a specific call-out to consider material weaknesses due to culture. The PRA notes that many firms are falling short on counterparty credit risk and that credit risk management and measurement must be adaptable to changing conditions. Focus will remain on exposures to NBFIs and other vulnerable/high risk sectors. The submission of timely, complete and accurate regulatory returns, improved data aggregation, financial resilience including effective balance sheet, funding and liquidity management, and focus on operational resilience including cyber resilience are also on the 2025 agenda.
Firm-specific capital communications: The PRA has published PS2/25
opens in a new tab
(following CP9/24), setting out final policy and rules to simplify the content and process of firm—specific capital communications used to set Pillar 2A, the systemic buffers and the Additional Leverage Ratio Buffer (ALRB). The final policy is as set out in CP9/24
opens in a new tab
, with one minor change that has “no meaningful effect on the policy”. The final policy is as set out in CP9/24
opens in a new tab
, with one minor change that has “no meaningful effect on the policy”. PS2/25 has no impact on capital requirements.

Insurance

Life insurance stress test: The PRA has launched
opens in a new tab
its 2025 Life Insurance Stress Test (LIST) 2025 to assess the resilience of major UK life insurers against a set of adverse scenarios. The LIST is a biennial exercise, and participating firms will be required to submit their results by 16 June 2025 using the provided templates and guidelines. The PRA aims to publish individual firm results for the core scenario and aggregated sector results in Q4 2025. Read KPMG article for more detail.

Capital Markets and Asset Management

Accelerated Settlement (T+1): The UK Accelerated Settlement Taskforce Technical Group has published its final report
opens in a new tab
recommending that the UK move to T+1 settlement on 11 October 2027. The report recommends 12 ‘critical’ and 27 ‘highly recommended’ actions to facilitate a successful transition to T+1. HM Treasury has welcomed the report and will set out its response shortly. Concurrently, the European Commission is also proposing
opens in a new tab
11 October 2027 as an appropriate date for the EU to move to T+1 settlement and has proposed an amendment to CSDR to facilitate this.
Wholesale brokers supervisory strategy: The FCA has outlined
opens in a new tab
its new supervisory strategy for wholesale brokers. Its strategic focus for the next two years will be on broker conduct, culture, business oversight and financial resilience. There is a stronger focus on conduct and culture in this letter than the other wholesale strategy letters that the FCA published last month.
Commodity Derivatives Regulatory Framework: The FCA PS25/1
opens in a new tab
aims to strengthen the resilience of the UK commodity derivatives markets. Measures include reducing the scope of contracts covered by the position limits regime but increasing the available exemptions from the regime for firms. It also transfers the responsibility of setting position limits to trading venues. The regime will fully apply from 6 July 2026 but transitional measures will start in March 2025. To learn more, please listen to this podcast
opens in a new tab
from KPMG in the UK’s commodities team.
Further changes to the public offers and admission to trading regime and listing rules: In July 2024, the FCA consulted upon the new prospectus regime. It has now issued further consultations. CP25/2
opens in a new tab
proposes changes to the rules to align disclosure requirements for low denomination bonds with those for higher denominations to make capital raising easier for issuers. The FCA is also proposing changes to the UK Listings Rules to make them more efficient for companies issuing further securities. CP25/3
opens in a new tab
outlines its proposals for the implementation and operation of the new public offer platform (POP), including how the FCA intends to authorise firms seeking to operate POPs, its intended supervision approach for these firms and a potential transitional regime. The POP regime facilitates companies making public offers of securities to a broad range of investors outside public markets when raising more than £5m. Firms likely to be interested in becoming POP operators are crowdfunding operators and corporate finance firms.
Pension fund clearing exemption: Following the responses to its call for evidence
opens in a new tab
 on the pension fund exemption from obligations to clear certain derivatives contracts (under UK EMIR), HM Treasury has decided that the exemption should be maintained for the long-term. It will now take forward legislation to ensure that the exemption does not expire on 18 June 2025 as currently scheduled and to remove any further time limit on the exemption.
Money laundering through markets (MLTM): The FCA has updated
opens in a new tab
its assessment of MLTM based on further supervisory work and discussions with key stakeholders. The FCA found there has been progress but identifies areas where firms need to improve to protect against money laundering. These include better estimation of the risks of money laundering firms are exposed to, less reliance on others in the transaction chain to complete appropriate due diligence checks on customers and more information sharing between firms. The report includes examples of good and poor practice on enhancing systems, controls and training as well as detailed areas of focus for firms.

Payments

Updated strategy 2025  — 2027: The PSR has published
opens in a new tab
an updated strategy outlining its plans to deliver competition, innovation and growth in the payments sector over the next two years. The strategy outlines PSR's three core commitments: completing work on projects underway, progressing work upgrading payment systems, and sharpening focus on competition and innovation. Key deliverables include implementing the commercial model for variable recurring payments (VRP) and ensuring the appropriate regulation of card fees. The PSR intends to further enhance its innovation capability, removing unnecessary barriers to payments innovation. 
Supervisory strategy for payment firms: The FCA has written
opens in a new tab
to its payment portfolio firms outlining its key priorities. Despite acknowledging improvements by some firms in areas such as governance arrangements, the FCA remains concerned about ongoing risks to consumers and the integrity of the payments financial system. Consequently, the FCA has identified three essential outcomes for payment firms to achieve good customer outcomes: (i) effective competition and innovation, (ii) firms not compromising financial system integrity and (iii) safeguarding customers' money. Although not identified as a specific outcome, the FCA emphasises the importance of strong governance, oversight and leadership in ensuring the delivery of these outcomes. FCA cited that weaknesses in these areas are a root cause of many of the regulatory issues observed in the portfolio.
Next steps for open banking: The FCA and PSR have issued
opens in a new tab
a joint statement outlining the next steps for open banking in the UK, with a particular focus on the implementation of VRPs. These allow customers to securely connect authorised payment providers to their bank accounts using open banking, enabling the initiation of recurring payments. This development is an important step towards enhancing open banking for e-commerce, as it empowers consumers to take greater control of their regular payments. Open Banking Limited has been tasked with establishing an independent operator to coordinate and facilitate the implementation of VRPs.
Compliance monitoring framework: The PSR has published a new compliance monitoring framework outlining its approach, expectations and approach to non-compliance. The framework has been developed in response to several important new regulations coming into force (e.g. APP reimbursement), which have increased the PSR's need to identify and manage non-compliance. The PSR's approach is underpinned by three principles (i) Proportionate and risk-based, (ii) Acting quickly, and (iii) Clear, reciprocal engagement.
APP scams reimbursement claims management system: The PSR has confirmed
opens in a new tab
its intention to consult on rules requiring the use of Pay. UK's reimbursement claims management system (RCMS). The consultation is scheduled for April 2025, with any resulting rules anticipated to be implemented in late 2025. Following a previous consultation
opens in a new tab
, the PSR deferred a decision on these rules, committing to re-consult once the APP reimbursement rules are in effect. This pre-announcement aims to inform stakeholders of the upcoming consultation and encourage broad participation to ensure an effective outcome.

Supervisory strategy for claims management companies: The FCA has written
opens in a new tab
to the CEOs of its Claims Management Company (CMCs) portfolio firms outlining priorities for the next two years. While recognising some improvements, the FCA notes areas where firms are still falling short of its expectations. The FCA’s priorities are: embedding the Consumer Duty, service standards, personal injury and lead generation. The FCA also highlights a number of issues it expects CMCs to pay particular regard to including misleading advertising (see financial promotions update below), inappropriate sourcing of customers, poor attitude towards regulatory obligations and approaches to complaints submission.
Case fees for professional representatives: The FOS has confirmed
opens in a new tab
the introduction of case fees for complaints referred to the FOS by professional representatives (PRs) e.g. law firms and CMCs. From 1 April 2025, PRs will only be entitled to bring ten cases each financial year for free, with every additional case charged a fee of £250. Where cases are upheld, the fee will be reduced to £75. Where a PR’s complaint is not upheld or is withdrawn, the respondent firm will pay a reduced case fee of £475. These changes are intended to make funding arrangements fairer and encourage PRs to consider the merits of complaints before referral, and to ensure referred complaints are better evidenced.
Supervisory strategy for mortgage intermediaries: The FCA has written
opens in a new tab
to the CEOs of the mortgage intermediaries portfolio firms setting out its supervisory priorities for the portfolio over the next two years. The FCA’s strategic focus will be on the suitability of mortgage advice, high pressure selling, value for money, and the quality of financial promotions.

Supervisory strategy for CRA and CISPs: The FCA has written
opens in a new tab
to the CEOs of credit reference agencies and credit information service providers (CRA & CISP) setting out its supervisory priorities for the portfolio over the next two years. The FCA’s strategic focus will be on embedding the Consumer Duty, operational resilience, cyber resilience, financial resilience and (v) addressing actions stemming from the Credit Information Market Study (CIMS).
Financial promotions 2024: The FCA has published
opens in a new tab
2024 financial promotions data which shows a significant increase in FCA interventions in response to non-compliant financial promotions, with nearly 20,000 amended or withdrawn, a 97.5% increase compared to 2023. The financial promotions of CMCs accounted for 46% of the total amended or withdrawn. The report also highlights action taken in relation to finfluencers, buy-now-pay-later promotions and unauthorised firms, with 20 finfluencers interviewed under caution and 38 alerts issued about unlawful promotions on social media.

Operational Resilience

opens in a new tab
until 13 March on joint rules to set a framework for high-quality, timely and consistent reporting of the operational incidents and third-party arrangements that may have the greatest impact on financial stability. The proposals include a clear definition of operational incidents and require firms to submit standardised reports on incidents that breach one or more specific thresholds.

Digital Finance and Innovation

Impact of AI: The UK Parliament Treasury Committee has launched
opens in a new tab
 a Call for Evidence on the impacts of the increased use of AI in banking, pensions and other areas of financial services. In particular, the Committee is seeking to understand how firms can utilise AI whilst still protecting consumers against potential risks. Evidence is requested from a range of stakeholders including the finance industry, the AI sector, consumers and experts.

ESG and Sustainable Finance

PRA Climate Change Adaptation Report: The PRA has published its latest Climate Change Adaptation Report
opens in a new tab
, summarising key work performed to date, as well as its latest views on firms' progress in managing climate-related risks. The report flags the PRA's planned update of the expectations in SS3/19, with a consultation expected in H1 2025 followed by an updated supervisory statement. The Climate Financial Risk Forum (CFRF) will continue to provide a forum for industry to share experiences and build on existing guidance to help firms meet revised supervisory expectations. The BoE continues to assess the potential build-up of systemic risks relating to climate change.
FCA Adaptation Report: The FCA has also published its report
opens in a new tab
highlighting climate adaptation risks for financial services firms. The FCA notes that the insurance sector faces increased claims due to extreme weather events and highlights concerns about the future affordability and availability of insurance. Banking adaptation risks include reduced mortgage lending due to reduced flood insurance availability and increased defaults in commercial lending following climate-related economic downturns. Investment risks involve volatility in agricultural markets and water shortages impacting companies. The response to climate adaptation has involved FCA-mandated climate risk disclosures and industry collaboration through the CFRF, but there continue to be barriers around data availability, insurance underwriting approaches and allocation of capital.

European Commission publishes work program for 2025

European Commission – work program – Omnibus proposals – 28th legal regime – Competitiveness – Simplification – Clean Industrial Deal – Draghi Report – Single Market – DAC9 – Unshell – Transfer Pricing Directive – ATAD – DEBRA – BEFIT – Digital Services Tax

On February 11, 2025, the European Commission published its work program 2025 outlining its ambition to boost competitiveness, enhance security, and bolster economic resilience in the EU.
From a direct tax perspective, key takeaways include:
announcement of a so-called “Omnibus simplification packages” aiming to reduce reporting burdens by 25 percent for all companies and 35 percent for SMEs;
announcement of a proposal for a so-called ""28th legal regime,"" which would allow innovative companies to operate across the EU under a single set of rules, simplifying corporate law, insolvency, labor law, and also taxation;
finalization of the ATAD evaluation is expected in the fourth quarter of 2025;
previous Directive proposals including DAC 9, BEFIT, Transfer Pricing Directive, DEBRA, Unshell, Digital Services Tax proposal, Significant Digital Presence proposal, and the Financial Transaction Tax continue to be listed as pending files.

Background

Following the European Parliament elections in June 2024, the new College of Commissioners was appointed and started its five-year term on December 1, 2024. Ursula von der Leyen remains President of the European Commission for a second term. Key appointments include:
Wopke Hoekstra as the new Commissioner for Climate, Net Zero and Clean Growth, also responsible for taxation,
Valdis Dombrovskis as the new Commissioner for Economy and Productivity, who will also support in taxation matters, and
Maroš Šefčovič as new Commissioner for Trade and Economic Security, who will be the main person to engage on tariffs.
On September 9, 2024, former European Central Bank President, Mario Draghi, presented his Report on the future of European competitiveness including recommendations for the EU centered on innovation, decarbonization, and security (hereinafter “the Draghi Report”). Building on the Draghi Report, the European Commission recently published its Competitiveness Compass on January 29, 2025 as a roadmap for policymaking during the current legislative term, emphasizing these core areas along with measures to simplify the regulatory environment.
In addition, EU Finance Ministers participated in a policy debate focused on enhancing Europe's global business competitiveness through simplification, decluttering, and reducing regulatory burdens during the ECOFIN meeting on January 21, 2025. The discussion was not public, however, according to the Council press release, the ministers strongly endorsed the idea of easing and streamlining reporting requirements for businesses and expressed a united commitment to taking meaningful steps toward regulatory simplification, recognizing it as an effective approach to boosting the competitiveness of the EU economy.

European Commission’s work program 2025

On February 11, 2025, the European Commission (EC or the Commission) published its work program 2025
opens in a new tab
outlining its ambition to boost competitiveness, enhance security, and bolster economic resilience in the EU.
Competitiveness
As part of the European Commission’s effort to enhance business competitiveness, the work program includes plans to issue new initiatives, including:
28th legal regime: the work program makes reference to an upcoming proposal to establish a so-called 28th legal regime. According to the work program, this 28th legal regime initiative particularly focuses on new and growing businesses and aims to create a unified legal framework that would apply across the entire EU, operating alongside the 27 national legal systems. The framework seeks to simplify compliance for businesses and reduce administrative burdens operating across multiple Member States by offering a single set of rules in areas such as corporate law, insolvency procedures, labour regulations, as well as tax law. More details are expected to be published in the course of an Innovation Act proposal that the Commission will present later in the mandate. It is currently not clear what tax-related measures may be included in this initiative and whether there is a relationship with the EC’s BEFIT proposal for a new legislative framework for corporate taxation in the EU.
Clean Industrial Deal initiative: the work program further announces the upcoming Clean Industrial Deal initiative aiming to boost industrial competitiveness while supporting decarbonization. According to the work program, this will include the development of a new State aid Framework to accelerate the roll-out of renewable energy, strengthen industrial decarbonisation and ensure sufficient manufacturing capacities for clean tech. The Clean Industrial Deal initiative is expected to be published in the first quarter of 2025.
Simplifying rules and effective implementation
Accompanying the work program, the EC published a communication
opens in a new tab
on implementation and simplification setting out how the Commission plans, over the next five years, to make implementation of EU rules easier in practice, and to reduce administrative burdens and simplify EU rules.
In this context, the releases indicate plans to present so-called Omnibus packages as simplification proposals addressing interactions between different pieces of EU legislation. According to the accompanying communication, the Omnibus proposals are designed to address the priority sectors identified by stakeholders and mentioned in the Draghi report. With the Omnibus packages the Commission wants to contribute to its goal of reducing reporting burdens by 25 percent for all companies and 35 percent for SMEs.
Whilst the communication notes that the first two omnibus packages on “sustainability” and “investment simplification” are to be issued in the first quarter of 2025, it does not refer specifically to any direct tax measures.
ATAD evaluation
The work program further includes an annual plan for evaluations and so-called “fitness checks” of the EU acquis, ensuring continuity of the simplification and burden reduction efforts.
According to the work program, this includes the evaluation of the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive (ATAD), which is scheduled to be finalized in the fourth quarter of 2025 (previously expected in the third quarter of 2025).
Interested parties were previously invited to provide feedback to the evaluation of the ATAD until September 11, 2024 – see Euro Tax Flash Issue 548. According to the call for evidence document, the Commission intends to conduct an evidence-based assessment of the ATAD, based on the following five evaluation criteria: effectiveness, efficiency, relevance, coherence with other EU legislation (notably Pillar Two), and the EU added value of ATAD compared to what Member States could have achieved alone.
Note in this context that during his parliamentary confirmation hearing, the new Commissioner for Climate, Net-Zero and Clean Growth, Wopke Hoekstra, committed to focus on streamlining and simplifying EU tax policy and to deliver a holistic effort to declutter tax legislation by 2026.
Existing proposals still on the table
From a direct tax perspective, the work program refers to several existing Directive proposals as “pending”. This list includes:
Exchange of Top-up tax information returns in the EU (DAC9) - 2024: The proposal extends the scope of the Directive on Administrative Cooperation (DAC) to establish a framework for the exchange of information under the EU Minimum Tax Directive. Note that the proposal has already been approved by Members of the European Parliament by way of a non-binding resolution that was adopted on February 12, 2025. In a next step, the Directive proposal requires unanimous approval in the Council. Where the Directive is approved in the Council, it would enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the EU.
Business in Europe - Framework for Income Taxation (BEFIT) - 2023: The proposal provides for common rules for determining the corporate tax base for EU-based entities that are part of a group with global consolidated revenues above a certain threshold. BEFIT would also include provisions for the allocation of profits to relevant Member States. Once allocated, profits would be subject to the corporate income tax rate of the respective Member State.
Transfer Pricing Directive – 2023: The proposal aims at implementing common Transfer Pricing rules into EU law including the incorporation of the OECD arm’s length principle and a reference to the ‘OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations’ into EU law.
Head Office Tax system for micro, small and medium sized enterprises (HOT) - 2023: The Directive would allow certain EU-based standalone SMEs that operate in other EU Member States only through permanent establishments (PEs) to make a five-year election to determine the taxable results of the PEs according to the rules of the Member State of their head office.
Debt-equity bias reduction allowance (DEBRA) - 2022: The proposal provides for an allowance in respect of equity increases in a given tax year. In addition, the Directive proposes the introduction of a new limitation on interest deductibility, which would need to be applied alongside the interest limitation rules under ATAD.
Rules to prevent the misuse of shell entities for tax purposes (Unshell) - 2021: The initial proposal set out a list of indicators to filter entities at risk of being misused for tax purposes. High-risk entities would then be required to report on a series of substance indicators through their annual tax return. Companies failing to meet the substance indicators would be deemed to be ‘shell’ entities, potentially triggering tax consequences.
EU Digital Services Tax – 2018: Proposed coordinated approach to taxing revenues from certain digital services to avoid potential disparities arising within the EU as a result of the unilateral application of digital service taxes.
Corporate taxation of a significant digital presence - 2018: Proposed introduction of a taxable nexus for digital businesses operating within the EU.
Enhanced cooperation in the area of financial transaction tax (FTT) - 2013: Proposed introduction of a tax on qualifying financial transactions.
Directive proposals withdrawn
The work program notes that the proposal for a revised Interest and Royalties Directive (IRD) from 2011 has been deemed obsolete in light of the EU Minimum Tax Directive. It is noted that remaining issues will be addressed through an upcoming Omnibus act as part of the simplification process.
It is also noted that the 2020 proposal for the codification of the DAC is deemed obsolete in light of significant amendments to the DAC in the meantime. In this context, note that end of 2024, the Commission published
opens in a new tab
 a report providing a summary of the contributions made by stakeholders as part of a comprehensive evaluation aimed at assessing the effectiveness, efficiency, and ongoing relevance of the DAC and its subsequent amendments (DAC2 to DAC6). According to the report, the data collected from the consultation activities will from part of the final report detailing the conclusions drawn on the second DAC evaluation. This report is due to be submitted to the European Parliament and the Council in early 2025.
Note that the withdrawal of Commission proposal needs to be formally published in the EU Official Journal in order for the legislative process to end.

ETC Comment

The EC’s work program 2025 suggests that there are currently no specific plans for the European Commission to put forward new tax proposals. The focus seems to be instead on simplifying existing EU tax legislation and on reducing the administrative burden. However, the Omnibus bill mentioned in the work program in the context of the IRD withdrawal is not expected before early 2026 and it is not yet clear what the focus of that bill will be.
As regards the European Commission’s upcoming Clean Industrial Deal initiative, Commissioner Hoekstra noted during a hearing before the European Parliament’s Subcommittee on Tax Matters (FISC) on February 6, 2025, that this may take into consideration immediate expensing and accelerated depreciation incentives with a view to encourage businesses to invest in clean tech production. Such measures are likely to be in the form of best practices for Member States to consider rather than an EU-wide hard law initiative. 
The concept of a 28th legal regime was initially proposed in the Draghi report as a means to give innovative start-ups access to harmonized legislation (including a few aspects of taxation). Whilst no further details have yet been made public, during the hearing with the FISC Subcomittee, Commissioner Hoekstra indicated considerations to apply such new regime potentially also in a broader context (i.e., not only for new and growing businesses) subject to feedback from EU Member States. The Commissioner further noted that the BEFIT initiative may further contribute to the Commission’s aim of enhancing the EU’s competitiveness.
At the same time, it should be noted that the Commission decided not to withdraw certain Directive proposals that have made little process since their initial release:
Proposal for a Transfer Pricing Directive: The December 2024 report of the ECOFIN Council on the progress achieved during the term of the Hungarian Presidency indicated that the majority of Member States see no possibility in making further progress on the basis of the Commission proposal in its current form. However, the work program still lists the Transfer Pricing proposal as pending. In the course of the exchange with the FISC Subcommittee, Commissioner Hoekstra noted ongoing work on the proposed alternative approach in form of a new EU Transfer Pricing Platform. No formal indication has been given as to whether Member States would be required to commit to respecting the outcome of any views adopted by the Platform. Note that Article 296(3) TFEU prevents the Council from discussing and adopting acts that are considered to compete against pending Commission proposals. As such, it remains to be seen whether discussions on a new Platform will continue within the framework of the Transfer Pricing Directive proposal, or whether the Directive will ultimately be withdrawn in favor of a different instrument.
DEBRA proposal: The examination of the DEBRA Directive proposal has been suspended at Council level since end of 2022. Nevertheless, the EC 2025 work program continues to list the DEBRA proposal as a pending file. This aligns with previous comments made by Commissioner Hoekstra on the DEBRA initiative in the context of solutions for removing tax obstacles for the functioning of the EU capital markets. The Commissioner had noted that he intends to discuss the future of the DEBRA proposal with the Member States.

https://kpmg.com/xx/en/our-insights/regulatory-insights/the-growth-and-competitiveness-agenda-for-fs-regulators.html,Regulatory Insights,The Growth and Competitiveness Agenda for FS regulators,,"February 2025
As UK economic growth continues to be sluggish, pressure is building on financial services (FS) regulators to consider both growth and international competitiveness in their work.
This article looks at the origins of this agenda and the regulators’ reactions to the government’s demands. It also considers whether formal objectives will make a tangible difference, and the extent to which they are part of a wider trend towards deregulation.

The story so far

The Financial Services and Markets Act (FSMA) 2023 gave the PRA and FCA a secondary objective ‘to facilitate the international competitiveness of the UK economy and its medium to long-term growth, subject to aligning with relevant international standards’. The PRA
opens in a new tab
 and FCA
opens in a new tab
 reported on their progress against the objective in July 2024 and are required to report again in July 2025.
In May 2023, the then government published a paper
opens in a new tab
entitled “Smarter Regulation: Regulating for Growth” on improving “regulation across the board to reduce burdens, push down the cost of living and drive economic growth”.
In May 2024, the Lords Financial Service Regulation Committee launched an inquiry
opens in a new tab
into the FCA and PRA’s secondary competitiveness and growth objective and is likely to report in the next few months.
In her first Mansion House speech
opens in a new tab
in November 2024, the Chancellor set out her view that ‘the UK has been regulating for risk, but not regulating for growth’ and called for action.

She also announced that, in spring 2025, the UK government would publish the first Financial Services Growth and Competitiveness Strategy, focusing on five priority growth opportunities - fintech, sustainable finance, asset management and wholesale services, insurance and reinsurance and capital markets (including retail investment) by looking at five policy pillars including the regulatory environment.
The pressure for action intensified with Christmas Eve letters
opens in a new tab
from the Prime Minister to regulators in FS and beyond (including the PRA, FCA, OFWAT, OFCOM and the Civil Aviation Authority) asking for “concrete proposals on how [to] go further to prioritise growth and facilitate investment, supported by government”.

The regulators’ responses

The growth and competitiveness agenda represents a shift in the UK government’s expectations of FS regulators, marking a departure from the post-crisis, risk averse approach of the last 15 years. The government acknowledges that this will be a challenge for regulators whose primary legislative objectives continue to be, for the PRA, financial stability and policyholder protection and, for the FCA, consumer protection, market integrity and promoting competition.
The PRA and FCA have responded to the government’s call for growth proposals in somewhat different ways. The FCA is careful to point out that the shift to prioritising growth and competitiveness may come at the expense of its primary consumer protection objective and that the government and other stakeholders will have to accept that it will need to “take greater risks and rigorously prioritise resources”. Meanwhile, the PRA letter emphasises that all its objectives already support growth, as this is a fundamental component of its financial stability mandate. Although the PRA acknowledges that there is more that can be done, and that it is strongly committed to the new objective, the suggestion is that this will not result in wholesale changes.
Both the FCA and PRA responses set out current and planned initiatives that may support growth, including:

FCA initiatives
PRA initiatives
Existing
Planned
Existing
Planned
Implementing a new prospectus regime and launching a consolidated tape
Reducing conduct requirements for wholesale insurers
Streamlining regulatory requirements for asset managers
Reforming online pension tools, improving transfer times and finalising next steps on dashboards
Avoiding additional regulations by relying on existing AI frameworks
Continuing to reduce the reporting burden for firms (with the BoE)
Making the Senior Managers and Certification Regime more flexible
  Accelerate the review of capital requirements for specialised trading firms
Removal of the Consumer Duty ‘Board Champion’ role, and ensuring that future consultations on consumer protection ask if the Consumer Duty is sufficient rather than new rules
Simplifying responsible lending and advice rules for mortgages, supporting home ownership and discussing the balance between access to lending and levels of defaults
Consulting on removing maturing interest-only mortgage and other outdated guidance
Working with government to remove overlapping standards, e.g. the Mortgage Charter
Reviewing the proportionality of reporting requirements and removing redundant returns
Tailoring the Basel 3.1 regime to support competitiveness & growth
Implementing Solvency UK so that the life insurance sector can play a greater role in investing in the UK economy across a wider range of assets
Improving the efficiency of the authorisation process
  Simplifying the prudential regime for small banks
Consulting on ‘Matching Adjustment Investment Accelerator’ to increase the ability of the insurance sector to invest in the UK economy
Improving the UK framework for Insurance Special Purpose Vehicles (ISPV)
Simplifying regulatory data reporting from banks
Further amendments to remuneration requirements to enhance competitiveness

Areas that could be explored with government support include:

FCA
PRA
Reducing the costs of anti-money laundering measures
Relaxing KYC requirements on small transactions
Accelerating the modernisation of the Consumer Credit Act
A concierge service for inbound foreign firms
Rationalising the UK financial services regulators’ ‘have regards’
Potential overlaps between the PRA’s governance and disclosure requirements and those of legislation or other relevant regulators

Thus, so far, the response from UK regulators seems to be to make regulation more proportionate and less burdensome, by removing overlaps and inconsistencies, rather than ‘ripping up the rulebook’. In a recent interview, Sam Woods, PRA CEO, characterised the PRA’s approach as “clearing away a lot of undergrowth. We’re significantly pruning the trees but we’re not going to set fire to the forest”.

Will it make a difference?

Regulation is not the only way to impact growth and competitiveness. As mentioned above, it is one of five policy pillars in the government’s proposed FS Growth and Competitiveness Strategy, alongside innovation and technology, regional growth, skills and access to talent, and international partnerships and trade.
It is hard to say whether the changes that the regulators are implementing and proposing will make a material difference to the wider economy, or how long that might take. It will be challenging to quantify and attribute any difference, other than via the regulators’ own reports on their progress.
Firms will be excited by certain measures such as the FCA’s proposals to streamline the SM&CR and review its rule book for duplication following the implementation of Consumer Duty requirements. Some would also welcome further changes directly to the Consumer Duty itself because the evidential framework required to prove every good customer outcome can be viewed as disproportionate and disadvantageous from a UK:EU competitiveness perspective.
An area where changes can already be seen is in regulators’ engagement with industry, for example through the deployment of Subject Expert Groups (SEGs). More open discussion and the ability to contribute to policy development prior to formal consultation should lead to more proportionate and responsive regulation.
However, the effectiveness of other measures remains unclear. For instance, it is uncertain whether removing the £100 contactless limit will have any impact on growth. Indeed, none of the measures currently proposed is likely to lead directly to growth, although a reduction in regulatory burden may free up bandwidth and resources.
Taxation is one area that could significantly influence the financial services sector by encouraging growth but, given the government's tight fiscal situation, it is unlikely that proposals to reduce specific financial services taxes, such as the stamp duty on UK shares, will be taken forward at this time.

So, is deregulation the answer?

The UK is not the only jurisdiction considering the balance of its regulatory framework. The EU is also struggling with stagnant economic growth and has launched various initiatives to address competitiveness, including the recently published Competitiveness Compass
opens in a new tab
and an initial Omnibus Regulation which aims to simplify and consolidate overlapping sustainability reporting obligations, with others expected to follow. There have also been calls for a “Draghi-style report
opens in a new tab
” on the competitiveness of its banking sector. Meanwhile, the new US Administration has instigated a “regulatory freeze” – for more see KPMG US article here
opens in a new tab
.
On the flip side, FS firms are not always happy to see regulation reduced. Deregulation does not necessarily translate to increased competitiveness. Local trends towards deregulation could make regulatory compliance more complex for international firms if authorities move away from international standards.
Reduced consistency and interoperability of local regulations could have knock-on impacts on opportunities for equivalence or deference decisions – which could in fact have an adverse effect on competitiveness. And a reduction in regulation is still regulatory change which may require resources to be deployed for implementation and ongoing monitoring.
Deregulation for deregulation’s sake will not be a silver bullet – however there is a place for targeted actions with clear outcomes for firms.

The last five years has seen a rapid evolution in sustainability strategies for infrastructure and energy companies. We recently conducted a study with the International Finance Corporation
opens in a new tab
(IFC) of more than 100 companies that operate in emerging markets to identify trends in sustainability priorities, reporting practices and how strategies are anchored and financed at these companies.

Methodology

The study included 104 companies across six sectors: Energy, Technology, Media, and Telecom (TMT), Transport, Mining, Water & Waste, and “Cross-Cutting” companies with operations across more than one sector. Data was gathered from publicly available documents, company websites, and databases like S&P Capital IQ and LSEG Data & Analytics. This information was analyzed using a sector performance model developed by KPMG which considered 51 KPIs across Strategy, Governance, KPI & Data Reporting, Environmental, Social, and Community Benefit-Sharing.

Key findings

The path forward: Overcoming challenges and accelerating impact

Companies in emerging markets will benefit from the recent agreement at COP29 in Baku [1] that will triple climate finance to developing countries from the previous goal of US$ 100 billion annually, to US$ 300 billion annually by 2035. Moreover, multilateral development banks
opens in a new tab
at COP29 have pledged to increase climate finance for low- and middle-income countries to US$ 120 billion annually by 2030 [2].
The decarbonization challenges outlined in the study echo the recent KPMG 2024 CEO Outlook report which found that for 30% of survey respondents, the greatest barrier to achieving climate ambitions is the complexity presented by decarbonization of their supply chain [3]. Standardizing metrics and improving transparency in reporting, particularly for Scope 3 emissions, will facilitate better benchmarking and informed decision-making.
Study findings are consistent with our recent “Survey of Sustainability Reporting 2024”, which shows around half of the globally largest 250 companies across 58 countries now report on biodiversity. However, as growth has been slower in the last two years, companies may require technical support to increase their biodiversity and nature-based solutions efforts which would also facilitate access to nature-driven capital sources where needed as well.
As for the gender and social targets and disclosures, transparency related to gender diversity targets could be improved across sectors and gender diversity across all employee categories could be further enhanced within water & waste, TMT, and transport sectors.

Navigating the 2025 PRA Life Insurance Stress Test: Insights and Strategies
Seven key considerations for firms
In January 2025, the PRA unveiled
opens in a new tab
 the final calibrations for the Life Insurance Stress Test (LIST), a pivotal exercise designed to evaluate the resilience of the life insurance sector against severe but plausible adverse scenarios. This year's LIST is particularly significant as, for the first time, individual firm results for the core scenario will be disclosed publicly. This additional transparency aims to enhance market understanding of life insurers' resilience and foster greater discipline within firms.
The LIST is a biennial exercise, alternating with the general insurance stress test, and involves 11 legal entity insurance companies. Alongside the final calibrations and a Dear CEO letter, the PRA has previously set out the objectives, scenario specifications and the content required for firms to complete their 'Results and basis for preparation' (RBP). The deadline for submission of results is June 16 2025, with the PRA looking to publish results in Q4.
As firms prepare for the LIST, meticulous planning, disciplined project management and thorough results assurance will be crucial – particularly given the publication of individual results.
Below, KPMG in the UK breaks down the key considerations and scenarios that firms should focus on as they embark on this critical exercise.

Scenarios
The PRA has set out two types of scenarios for the LIST:
A 'core' 1-in-100 financial market stress, composed of three sub-stages. The core scenario simulates a severe global recession with a three-stage evolving financial market stress including drops in interest and inflation rates, equity and property value declines, and credit spread widening.
The results of this scenario will be published at individual firm level. The PRA will provide some market education for potential users of the results, in advance of the Q4 results publication.
Two exploratory scenarios on asset concentration and Funded Re recapture.  The asset concentration scenario assesses resilience to an additional stress for the asset type most material to the firm’s matching adjustment.  The Funded Re scenario asks insurers to look at the stress of recapturing their most material Funded Re arrangement. 
The ‘material’ Funded Re counterparty and asset type has been agreed directly between the PRA and the in-scope firms (but excludes corporate and government bonds).
Each of these stresses is applied after the three stages of the core scenario. Insurers are asked to submit quantitative data on their balance sheets, capital requirements and own funds, along with a qualitative report detailing their management actions and assumptions. The results of the exploratory scenarios will be published at an aggregate level.

Considerations for insurers

Key considerations for in-scope firms include:
Group/external disclosures: firms need to be able to articulate what their individual results mean to their stakeholders.  Insurers may want to include additional voluntary disclosures to cover the impact of further management actions or to show stresses at a different level, such as impact on group results (to supplement the legal entity results the PRA will publish).

Ordering of scenario modelling: the scenarios have to be applied in a specific order, with actions to be taken in between the stages. Firms need to consider the detailed modelling and ordering approach of these scenarios.

Funded reinsurance: the specific Funded Re recapture scenario requires look-through to underlying collateral, including how this is stressed in line with the scenarios and firm-specific matching adjustment (MA) eligibility assessments. Firms’ progress in complying with PRA expectations in PS 13/24 on Funded Re will likely impact the extent to which these processes are already set up. Even for well-progressed firms, YE24 may be the first time that full look-through Funded Re SCR calculations have been performed, so extending this to a stress and scenario exercise in early 2025 will be challenging.

Management actions: firms should consider the management actions to be implemented within the LIST, and any further management actions for the exploratory scenarios. There is further complexity as some management actions are implemented between scenario stages - firms may want to find ways to simplify their implementation.  If firms have automatic management actions, they should check if PRA requirements mean these actions need to be disabled for this exercise.
Stressing unmodelled calculation:  this needs to be assessed for each of scenario and for both base balance sheet and SCR.  Careful thought and documentation should be given as some UK Insurers have a large number of unmodelled calculations in the best estimate of liabilities (BEL) and SCR.

Planning and resourcing: firms need to create a detailed plan and confirm they have the resources for the project. A basis of preparation document will likely be required by end of February to meet the June deadline.

Level of review or assurance: Insurers need to determine the right level of internal or external review for the LIST process and results. The PRA expects the LIST results to be “of a standard equivalent to that which is sufficient for external unaudited public disclosure”.

Next steps for the PRA and insights from other stress tests
The primary purpose of the LIST is to examine firm-level resilience to stress events.  However, the PRA is likely also to consider whether further supervisory or policy steps are needed based on insights from the LIST – particularly for Funded Re (further information on Funded Re here
opens in a new tab
). 
Beyond firm-level resilience, the PRA is interested in the interlinkages between (re)insurers and private credit, an area of focus in the latest Bank of England (BoE) Financial Stability Report
opens in a new tab
.  The System-Wide exploratory scenario
opens in a new tab
(SWES) has also highlighted the conflict of interest between PE funds’ investment into (re)insurers, who in turn hold illiquid private assets in corporates within the fund’s portfolio. 
Moving forward, KPMG in the UK anticipates that the PRA could make stress tests across different sectors more consistent (e.g., using similar scenarios) and interlinked (e.g., looking at insurers’ coverage in response to flooding to consider implications for banks’ mortgage lending).

How KPMG in the UK can help
KPMG in the UK has a dedicated Actuarial, and Risk and Regulatory Advisory practice with extensive life insurance experience and insights. We can support firms with performing the LIST calculations or in performing a review exercise, including:
Review of LIST basis of preparation (BoP)
Scenario construction review and validation input
Review of key controls
Validation of management actions application
Assessment of the reasonableness of results
Reconciliation of the final PRA submission and report
Review of additional planned market disclosures

Having navigated the complexities of post-covid supply chain shocks and input inflation which required significant pricing action, Consumer and Retail (C&R) CEOs are back to focusing on delivering much-needed volume growth.
Yet, for many sub-sectors, volume growth will come second to volume preservation. Facing pressure on consumer spend from declines in disposable incomes, shifts towards unbranded products and waning product loyalty, many consumer goods companies are struggling to arrest declining volumes.

Fintech investment in Americas falls, even as Canada soars to record high
Fintech investment in the Americas fell to a six-year low of $63.8 billion in 2024 amid challenging macroeconomic factors, geopolitical tensions, and uncertainties related to the US election. M&A deal value fell to a six-year low of $39.5 billion, while PE investment fell to a seven-year low of $922.9 million. The VC market showed more resilience, attracting $23.4 billion —down slightly from $25 billion in 2023. Total fintech investment also fell slightly between H1’24 ($32.8 billion) and H2’24 ($31 billion), although Q4’24 saw $20.2 billion of H2’24’s total.

Canada attracted the largest fintech deal in the Americas during H2’24—the $6.3 billion buyout of Nuvei by Advent International — while the US accounted for the next four largest deals—the $4.5 billion buyout of Envestnet by Bain Capital, the $2.45 billion buyout of Candescent by Veritas Capital, the $1.6 billion acquisition of Transact Campus by Roper Technologies, and the $1.1 billion acquisition of Bridge by Stripe.
Key H2’24 highlights from the Americas include:
US attracts majority of fintech investment, but Canada sets new record
The US attracted the largest share of fintech investment in the Americas, despite investment falling from $72.8 billion to $50.7 billion year-over-year. Investment in Canada rose to a record $9.4 billion, driven by three buyouts (Nuvei — $6.3 billion, Plusgrade — $1 billion, Copperleaf — $731 million) and several $100 million+ VC deals, including three in H2’24 (Blockstream — $210 million, Q4 — $204 million, Koho — $140 million). During H2’24, the largest deals in Latin America came from outside of Brazil; Argentina-based Ualá’s raised $309 million, while Mexico-based Stori and Kapital raised $212 million and $188 million, respectively.
Regulations continuing to evolve in US despite some uncertainty
During H2’24, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) issued a number of new regulations, including a rule related to the oversight of digital payments apps8 and a rule requiring financial institutions transfer financial data to other providers at an individual’s request.9 With a new administration coming in H1’25, however, there is some uncertainty as to whether new regulations will stick.
Crypto space seeing resurgence; increasing interest in stablecoins
In H2’24, there was a notable increase in interest in crypto, particularly following the US election, with Bitcoin surging past the $100k mark for the first time. The was also an increase in interest in crypto infrastructure plays and in stablecoins; in H2’24, Ripple launched its RLUSD with approval by the New York Department of Financial Services.10
AI gaining traction, but still early days for fintech-focused solutions
General interest in AI-driven innovation surged in 2024, with investors increasingly interested in industry-focused solutions leveraging AI, enhanced automation and machine learning, and generative AI. Despite the intense interest, actual fintech focused solutions were relatively nascent; corporates showed particular interest in AI solutions focused on customer service enablement — using AI to extend the value of employees and help them more quickly address consumer needs.
Fintech gaining ground across Latin America
The fintech ecosystem in Latin America has rapidly expanded outside of Brazil and Mexico, with fintech hubs emerging in countries like Chile, Columbia, Argentina, and Costa Rica, and more mature fintechs expanding across borders. Chile made a major fintech push in 2024, introducing regulations to support its Fintech Act and to regulate activities like crowdfunding, alternative transaction systems, and the custody of financial instruments and services related to the exchange market.

Trends to watch for in H1’25
Increasing participation of PE firms given copious dry powder and pressure to provide returns, with interest focused on perceived high growth areas like embedded and B2B payments.
Increasing M&A, with corporates taking a more strategic and thoughtful approach to capability and market expansion and considering selling some of their non-core assets to realize value.
Growing focus on crypto and stablecoins, including how to productize them.
Market participants waiting to see what actions the new US administration takes on regulation.
Continued focus on the payments sector in Latin America, even as subsectors like KYC, blockchain and regtech begin to emerge.
AI transforming Latin America’s fintech ecosystem by enabling data-driven decisions.

While global fintech investment dropped in H2’24 compared to H1’24, a closer look at the Q4’24 results highlighted an upswing in total investment as interest rates continued to fall, the cost of capital began to improve, and the completion of a number of elections globally lessened some of the uncertainty in the global market. Despite ongoing geopolitical tensions and conflicts, there is some optimism that the fintech market globally has turned a corner and that investment and deal activity will continue to recover heading into H1’25.

Here are our top predictions for fintech in H1’25:

Payments

Payments sector regains momentum
After falling to $17.2 billion during 2023, global investment in the payments space picked up to $31 billion in 2024, driven significantly by defensive transactions. While deal value was heavily weighted towards H1’24 due to the $12.5 billion Worldpay deal, investor interest grew considerably in H2’24 as interest rates started to come down in many jurisdictions and as some global uncertainties began to stabilize. Similar to H1’24, the Americas attracted the largest payments deals, including the $6.3 billion take private of Canada-based Nuvei by PE firm Advent International and $1.6 billion acquisition of US-based Transact Campus by Roper Technologies.

Insurtech

Absence of M&A megadeals sinks Insurtech investment total
Total investment in insurtech dropped to just under $3.1 billion in 2024 — a level not seen in over ten years, driven in large part by the complete absence of M&A megadeals, which had become a staple in
the market in recent years. While the number of deals dropped only marginally year-over-year, deal sizes were relatively small compared to historical trends, particularly in the second half of the year. A $192 million raise by France-based Alan was the largest deal of H2’24, followed by a $140 million raise by
US-based Zing Health, and a $120 million raise by France-based Akur8. This compares to H1’24, when the largest deal was the $427 million acquisition of cyber-insurance company Corvus by Travellers.
The declining investment reflects a shift in investor sentiment from rational exuberance to realism; insurance carriers have become the major driver of insurtech investment as VC firms have pulled back given the high cost of financing and uncertain macroeconomic conditions.

Regtech

Regtech investment tapers off after H1’24 megadeal
Total global investment in regtech rose from $4.4 billion in 2023 to $7.4 billion in 2024, although the increase was driven primarily by Leonard Green’s $4 billion buyout of UK-based IRIS Software Group in H1’24. While investment in H2’24’s was much lower in H2’24, total deal volume remained relatively consistent between the first half of the year and the second. 
Given the complexities of the regulatory environment in financial services, there continued to be a lot of investor interest in regtech — particularly in software-as-a-service companies — although completed deals remained far and few in between during H2’24 as investors held off from completing deals given uncertainties within the global macroeconomic environment. Investor sentiment started to improve in Q4’24, which bodes well heading into 2025.

Wealthtech

Cybersecurity investment quiet in H2’24 as big players focus on integration
Direct investment in the cybersecurity space was very soft in 2024, accounting for just $890 million compared to $1.4 billion in 2023. After a very quiet H1’24, cybersecurity investment slowed even further in H2’24, driven in part by global macroeconomic challenges and the absence of significant M&A deals. Deal sizes were quite small during H2’24; the largest deal of the period was a $90 million raise by South Africa-based Cassava Technologies.
In recent years, the nature of investment in cybersecurity has shifted quite dramatically, with acquisitions by major tech companies — both global and regional — having a bigger role to play in investment totals than the cumulative value of smaller deals. The absence of these kind of acquisitions likely accounts for the significant drop-off in funding in H2’24 given cybersecurity continues to be a significant challenge across all regions.

Cybersecurity

After falling to more than ten-year low, investment in wealthtech doubles in 2024
Total global investment in wealthtech doubled from a more than ten-year low of $190 million in 2023 to $400 million in 2024. Most of this investment came in H2’24, including four of the five largest wealthtech deals of the year — a $73.9 million raise by US-based Edward Jones, a $60 million raise by US-based Bitwise, a $58.5 million raise by Sweden-based Baseload Capital, and a $47.9 million raise by India-based Neo Asset Management.

Digital assets & currencies

Brighter skies ahead for digital assets space
Investment in digital assets and currencies globally rose from $8.7 billion to $9.1 billion between 2023 and 2024, although the more notable rise came in the US, where investment in the space rose from $3.2 billion to $5.4 billion year-over-year. Interest and investment in the US picked up in H2’24, driven by a combination of factors including the election of a new US president expected to be crypto friendly, Bitcoin reaching the $100,000 mark for the first time, and the increasing involvement of institutional investors —which has helped cement crypto’s place as a legitimate asset.
The Americas saw the largest deals in the digital assets and currencies space in H2’24, including Stripe’s $1.1 billion acquisition of stablecoin infrastructure business Bridge and a $525 million raise by Praxis — both based in the US — and a $210 million raise by Canada-based Blockstream. A $100 million raise by UK-based Crytocoin and an $80 million raise Singapore-based Partior — a blockchain-based, real-time clearing and settlements firm — were the largest deals in EMEA and ASPAC, respectively.

Total fintech investment in the EMEA region fell from $27.6 billion in 2023 to $20.3 billion in 2024. H2’24 was particularly weak, with just $7.3 billion in investment compared to $13 billion in H1’24. After dropping to a ten-year low of $7.2 billion in 2023, M&A activity saw a small increase to $8 billion, while M&A deal volume remained relatively steady. VC investment fell slightly from $12.9 billion to $11.4 billion, while PE accounted for only $897 million in investment during all of 2024.

The UK accounted for nearly half of the region’s annual fintech investment ($9.9 billion), despite a drop from $13.6 billion
in 2023; UK-based investment was particularly soft in H2’24, accounting for only $2.3 billion of this total. The Middle East saw fintech investment swell from $1.2 billion to $2.2 billion year-over year, while fintech investment in France remained almost steady at $1.1 billion. Germany’s fintech market continued to struggle in 2024, attracting a ten-year low of $815 million in investment.
Key H2’24 highlights from the EMEA region include:
Strongest companies still raising funds
Within EMEA, strong businesses — ones turning a profit, or with proven business models and a strong growth trajectory — continued to attract investment in H2’24. Other startups moved to cut costs, adapt their business models, or pivot to better satisfy their investors. Not all companies were successful; In H2’24, the region saw a growing number of businesses sold or wound down.
Interest in AI solutions growing
AI continued to gain attention among fintech investors in the EMEA region, with some AI-focused fintechs attracting interest and investment — particularly from corporates. Concerns around how to effectively monetize AI however kept investment relatively conservative; to date, most AI-focused deals have focused on solutions aimed at driving back-office efficiencies.
Embedded payments not getting the traction seen elsewhere
While embedded payments solutions have seen a solid rise in interest from investors across much of the world, they have not gained the same traction in the EMEA region due to the legacy products on offer and consumer preferences for those methods, particularly the use of credit and debit cards.
Interest in B2B wealthtech picking up
During H2’24, the EMEA region saw a real dial up in interest for solutions focused on capital markets, such as trading platforms, post-trade settlement solutions, and anything to do with data-based tools and analytics. Fintech investors were particularly interested in B2B software solutions, in part because of their potential ability to generate more reliable cash flows, but also because such solutions can be easier to take across borders compared to consumer facing solutions.
Increasing number of secondary transactions
Given the dry exit environment over the last two years, there has been a growing number of secondary transactions as fintechs have reached profitability. This has been driven by long-standing investors wanting to liquidate some of their position and by companies looking to reward their early employees. Given the challenges facing the UK’s capital markets in particular, secondary transactions could remain quite robust in 2025.
Regulatory changes garnering attention
The evolving regulatory regimes in both the EU and the UK have made it challenging for startups, scaling fintechs, and other market participants, potentially driving them to focus more on compliance than on other activities. During H2’24, both the AI Act and the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation came into force in the EU.

Trends to watch for in H1’25
Continued investment in regtech given the ongoing evolution of regulations and the complexities associated with compliance.
Growing interest in the development of AI agents able to act independently, particularly in areas like AML and financial crime detection.
Increasing regulatory burden acting as a potential driver for consolidation.
Continued focus on secondary transactions given subdued IPO environment.
Further development of the digital euro and its ecosystem changing the game for investment, use case development, and the enhancement of an ISV ecosystem.

Fintech funding in ASPAC region falls to ten-year low
Total fintech investment in the ASPAC region fell to $11.4 billion in 2024 — the lowest level seen since 2014; the decline was driven by several factors, including geopolitical uncertainties associated with the mass changes to governments globally, the continued focus on efficiency and cost cutting among many corporates, and the continued softness in China’s fintech sector. The payments sector remained quite a hot area of investment throughout the region, while lending-focused solutions continued to struggle.

Total fintech investment in China dropped from $2.6 billion to just $687 million between 2023 and 2024, while investment in India slipped from $4.4 billion to $4.1 billion. Other jurisdictions saw more positive results; Australia saw fintech investment more than double from $839 million to $2.1 billion year-over-year, while investment in Japan held steady at $662 million.
Key H2’24 highlights from the Asia-Pacific region include:
Biggest deals in H2’24 come outside of China and India
During H2’24, growing fintech hubs attracted the five largest deals in the ASPAC region, including a $788 million VC raise by Philippines-based digital payments firm platform Mynt, the
$539 million acquisition of Australia-based credit analysis firm Illion by Experian, a $229 million raise by Japan-based lending company Gojo & Company, the $197 million acquisition of Australia-based investment research company Lonsec by Generation Development Group, and the $154 million acquisition of Malaysia-based payments services company GHL Systems by NTT Data Payment Services.
Interest in AI-driven solutions on the rise, particularly in the regtech space
Fintech investors in the ASPAC region showed increasing interest in AI-driven solutions within the financial services sector. While this interest has not yet translated into significant deal value, it is an area expected to see rapid growth; regtech will likely be the first major target of AI-focused fintechs in the region — particularly in areas like risk and controls — in addition to operational activities like marketing and customer services as companies look to become more efficient.
Continuing focus on the development of digital currencies, assets, and infrastructure
In 2024, there continued to be a significant push to develop digital financial markets infrastructure, digital currencies, and digital assets within the ASPAC region. Several major projects including Agora, mBridge, Guardian, Ensemble, Orchid, and GL1 have evolved primarily in ASPAC, driven by partnerships between local and global organizations. During H2’24 in particular, Hong Kong launched the second phase of its e-HKD pilot scheme.
Five Finance Strategy driving focus of fintech investment in China
Fintech investment in China remained dry in H2’24, with much of the investment going to startups working to enable traditional financial institutions, particularly around the pillars of China’s Five Finance Strategy (i.e., technology finance, green finance, digital finance, inclusive finance, and elder finance). During H2’24, there appeared to be growing interest in IPO exists among mature fintechs; whether these exits materialize will be something to watch for in 2025.
Strategic M&A still a key focus
Strategic M&A continued to be a focus for fintech investors in the ASPAC region during H2’24, particularly among corporates and other providers looking to gain scale benefits and smaller startups looking to merge to become more competitive.

Trends to watch for in H1’25
Increasing investment outside of China as macroeconomic conditions improve.
Growing focus on generative AI and on AI-enablement, but particularly in China.
Several central banks across the ASPAC region finalizing pilots or moving beyond pilots and into production during 2025.
China-based fintechs beginning to look at IPO opportunities again.

Global fintech investment sinks to seven-year low
During 2024, the global fintech market saw $95.6 billion of investment across 4,639 deals — lows not seen since 2017 — as the market weathered macroeconomic challenges, geopolitical conflicts and tensions, and a year of elections in numerous jurisdictions. The Americas saw the largest share of this investment, attracting $63.8 billion across 2,267 deals, including $50.7 billion across 1,836 deals in the US. Comparatively, the EMEA region attracted $20.3 billion across 1,465 deals, while the ASPAC region attracted $11.4 billion across 896 deals.

H2’24 sees drop in global fintech investment, but uptick in Q4’24 sparks optimism
While global fintech investment fell from $51.7 billion in H1’24 to $43.9 billion in H2’24, the quarterly results provided a sense of positivity heading into 2025, with investment growing from $18.0 billion in Q3’24 to $25.9 billion in Q4’24. A similar trend occurred in both the Americas and EMEA regions; the Americas saw $31 billion in fintech investment in H2’24 — of which $20.2 billion came in Q4’24, while EMEA attracted $7.3 billion in H2’24 — of which $4 billion came in Q4’24.  Meanwhile, investment in the ASPAC region dipped slightly from $5.8 billion to $5.5 billion between H1’24 and H2’24. 
Payments sector remains fintech superstar
After falling to $17.2 billion in 2023, global investment in the payments space increased to $31 billion in 2024. While the largest deal of the year came in H1’24 (Worldpay - $12.5 billion), H2’24 saw solid deals in all regions, including the $6.3 billion buyout of Canada-based Nuvei, the $1.6 billion buyout of US-based Transact Campus, a $788 million raise by Philippines-based Mynt, the $385 million acquisition of UAE-based NeoPay, a $309 million raise by Argentina-based Ualá, and a $267 million raise by UK-based Zepz. The broad applicability and growth potential of payments solutions — and the ongoing expansion of the space into areas like B2B payments — is expected to keep investor interest hot well into 2025.
Dry exit environment keeping investors cautious
After falling to a seven-year low of $28.5 billion in 2023, global exit deal value for fintechs picked up slightly in 2024 to $37.3 billion, even as the volume of exits fell for the third straight year — from 399 deals to 367 deals. Despite the small pickup, the exit environment remained incredibly soft, continuing a trend seen in the wake of the outlier years of 2020 and 2021, when exit values surged from $48.3 billion in 2019 to $104.7 billion in 2020, and then to $395.2 billion in 2021. The lack of sustained exits, combined with ongoing market uncertainty and concerns about valuations and potential down rounds, likely kept many fintech investors on the fence in 2024. It likely also contributed to the increasing interest in continuation funds and the use of secondary transactions to provide liquidity.

M&A deal value falters year-over-year, but Q4’24 results positive
Global M&A activity fell from $60.2 billion to $49.6 billion between 2023 and 2024 as large M&A transactions remained in short supply. While M&A deal value dropped from $28.1 billion to $21.6 billion between H1’24 and H2’24, deal value nearly doubled from $7.4 billion to $14.2 billion between Q3’24 and Q4’24; with interest rates coming down and the uncertainty related to various elections now calming, the end-of-year uptick bodes well for the M&A market heading into 2025. PE investment also declined significantly, falling from $10.5 billion in 2023 to just $2.55 billion in 2024, while VC investment dropped more modestly, from $49.1 billion to $43.4 billion.

Crypto sees new wave of investment
Global investment in digital assets and currencies rose from $8.7 billion in 2023 to $9.1 billion in 2024; four of the five largest crypto deals of 2024 occurred in H2’24, including the $1.1 billion acquisition of Bridge by Stripe and VC raises by Praxis ($525 million), Blockstream ($210 million), and Current ($200 million). H2’24 also saw mBridge announce that it had reached minimal viable product stage; the project is a collaboration between organizations and central banks primarily in the ASPAC region and Middle East to develop a single platform for cross border transactions of multiple CBDCs.1 Stablecoins also saw growing interest in 2024, with US-based Ripple launching its RLUSD during H2’24.2
Real economy corporates continuing to invest in financial services
Corporate VC-participating investment globally dropped from $26.9 billion in 2023 to $19.6 billion in 2024. Both the Americas and ASPAC saw considerable declines in CVC investment, while EMEA saw a small rise year-over-year. Investment from financial institutions was particularly slow, in part because of their ongoing struggle to understand and leverage the economics of fintech businesses. Real economy corporates however continued to invest in a wide range of fintech solutions, both to extend their products and services to customers and to capture more of their value chain —particularly on the e-commerce front.

Trends to watch for in H1’25
Payments continuing to drive a large share of fintech investment globally.
Fresh interest in digital assets and currencies, particularly in areas like market infrastructure, stablecoins, and digital tokenization.
Continuing use of secondary transactions and continuation funds to give investors liquidity.
Growing focus on AI-focused regtech as corporates look to enable efficiencies.
Increasing focus on improving cross-border flows of credit.
Several mature fintechs around the world preparing for IPOs, particularly those able to demonstrate annual recurring revenues.

The speed of technological change in recent years is helping to deliver enormous benefits. ERP systems, cloud solutions, AI, data analytics and automation are helping to increase innovation, efficiency and productivity, improving customer and employee experiences, and enabling businesses to launch products and enter new markets faster.
Platforms, hosted on the cloud by hyper-scalers, and increasingly powered by AI, are processing almost unimaginable volumes of data to give insights on customers, competitors, and partners, and enabling real-time digital interactions.
But this digital revolution also creates new attack surfaces for hackers, criminals and bad actors to infiltrate organizations, steal data and disrupt operations. Cyber threats are constantly evolving, with AI offering creative ways to masquerade as authorized users via phishing and other tactics. In an always-online world, your employees provide common entry opportunities for unwelcome parties, and should be seen as ‘human firewalls’ on the frontline of cybersecurity.
To maintain cybersecurity, businesses should be seeking to transfer controls from legacy systems to the new technology environment, combining technical controls with embedded security behavior – something discussed in detail in a recent KPMG paper A new age of cybersecurity culture.
Security measures help prevent unauthorized access, data breaches, and cyber-attacks, while privacy protocols help ensure that customer information is handled in compliance with regulations and ethical standards. By embedding security and privacy into every stage of the transformation process, organizations can build customer trust, avoid regulatory penalties, and protect their brand reputation.
Crucially, it’s often easier and more effective to embed cybersecurity into new systems during the transformation process – rather than reacting to problems as they occur. Security should be an integral part of any transformation plan, helping to build appropriate governance, identify risks, and design controls, as part of a security-by-design methodology that begins in the strategy and planning phases. Ideally, this should all be in place before choosing any vendors.

Good practice in cybersecurity and privacy

In a 2024 KPMG survey of cybersecurity professionals, most respondents self-rated their organization’s cybersecurity culture as just ‘three out of five’, where five is ‘dynamic’ and ‘highly responsive’ to the changing threat landscape.
To move up this scale, businesses should adopt good practices, such as encrypting all sensitive data both in transit and at rest to prevent unauthorized access. Strict access controls can ensure that only authorized personnel can access sensitive information, while regular security audits and continuous monitoring help detect and respond to potential threats in real-time. Regular ‘hackathons’ have become an essential part of cybersecurity, particularly following systems updates that can increase vulnerabilities.
Compliance is another ‘must’, to meet data protection and privacy regulations such as GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), and DORA (Digital Operational Resilience Act); the latter obliges EU financial services organizations to prove they can stay resilient in the event of a severe operational disruption.
And, by formulating robust incident response plans, organizations should be positioned to quickly address and mitigate the impact of any security breaches.
Given the exponential growth in AI, cyber leaders should pay close attention to its use and consider the risks of employing different AI tools and technologies. Although controls can instill greater trust in AI, cyber leaders should also be aware of and monitor risks such as information bias, hallucination, and ethical and regulatory compliance.

Reinforcing the ‘human firewall’

According to KPMG’s 2024 cybersecurity survey, the top two culture challenges both relate to human behavior, with “resistance to change” as the number one concern, and “managing human risk factors and creating a strong cybersecurity culture” as number two.
Which only emphasizes the importance of encouraging good habits as second nature, as part of a holistic cybersecurity culture encompassing leadership, workers, suppliers and partners. Indeed, 74 percent of the survey respondents feel that building a cybersecurity-focused culture is central to successful integration of AI across the enterprise.
Whether it’s using hard-to-guess passwords, avoiding open public broadband networks, or being highly aware of – and reporting – suspicious phishing emails, a vigilant workforce can significantly reduce the chance of a cyber breach.
Measuring performance is a vital task, to drive boardroom discussions and bridge any communication gaps. Useful metrics include unauthorized downloads, secure password management, timely installation of software patches, data loss prevention rule violations, and potential or real security incidents reported.

Keeping one step ahead

The speed of technological change is only likely to get faster, so cybersecurity leaders should be closely attuned to the future direction of the business and seek to anticipate the associated cyber security challenges. Close collaboration on strategic and transformation plans can help organizations benefit from technology without increasing their risk exposure. By doing this, they can make cybersecurity a strategic enabler rather than a barrier.

Highlights

– What’s the issue?
– What are the requirements?
– What’s the impact?
– Actions for management

What's the issue?

The measurement of financed and facilitated emissions is a complex and fast-moving area. These emissions represent key metrics for commercial banks, insurance companies and asset managers (together, ‘financial institutions’). Those metrics help users to understand what the financial institution is funding and therefore both its ability to influence global emissions and its exposure to transition risk.

Many global banks currently quantify and disclose financed emissions for a subset of their lending exposures – i.e. those in specific sectors. However, measurement methodologies and practices continue to evolve and vary, and it is challenging to give users an end-to-end view of total financed and facilitated emissions at this stage. Most banks do not yet disclose facilitated emissions.

Emissions that financial institutions fund is an important area where the ISSB is balancing the drive to consistency while acknowledging that calculation methodologies need to evolve in practice.

What are the requirements?

The climate standard1 requires financed emissions disclosures for companies with commercial banking, insurance, or asset management activities. To avoid restricting the development of industry practice, the measurement requirements are high-level, and companies need to disclose the methodology used.
Facilitated emissions disclosures for investment banking and brokerage activities, and emissions associated with insurance (or re-insurance) underwriting portfolios (insurance-associated emissions), are not explicitly required because the methodology is not yet sufficiently mature.
The financed emissions disclosure requirements include the following.

Reliefs are available, including a later effective date for all Scope 3 disclosures and permitting inclusion of value chain information with non-aligned reporting periods.
When the climate standard was issued, facilitated emissions disclosure was highlighted as an area for future consideration, along with emissions associated with insurance (or re-insurance) underwriting portfolios.
Stakeholders – including regulators, preparers and investors – have provided feedback about potential areas of clarification that would support implementation of the climate standard. In response, the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) plans to propose a set of narrow-scope amendments to the standard.
The proposals include:
relief from using GICS to disaggregate emissions if not already doing so or if required by a local jurisdiction to use another system; and
limiting the disclosure of Scope 3 Category GHG emissions to financed emissions as defined in the climate standard and specifically excluding derivatives.
For more information, see Proposals to simplify IFRS S2

What’s the impact?

The requirement to report on financed emissions brings with it various complexities, including determining appropriate measurement methodologies and overcoming issues with incomplete, outdated or inaccurate data. Our benchmarking analysis showed that data challenges currently hinder the quantification of financed and facilitated emissions, and comparability across banks.
Financial institutions reporting these metrics will need a lot of data – it may take many years to gather relevant data and develop effective reporting, so they should make it a priority now.

Actions for management

Familiarise yourself with the requirements for commercial banking, asset management and insurance activities.
Work with a specialist to understand how the climate standard applies to your lending or investment portfolio and what data will be required.
Consider the systems, processes and controls needed to support your reporting.
Engage with peers – the PCAF2 standard is an example of industry-led collaboration to resolve a complex challenge. This industry-led collaboration is expected to continue.
Follow the discussion and engage with the ISSB’s consultation on amendments to the climate standard.

Highlights

– What changes are being proposed?
– What’s next?
– Actions for management – Have your say when the consultation opens

Stakeholders – including regulators, preparers and investors – have provided feedback about potential areas of clarification that would support implementation of IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures. In response, the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) decided in its meeting on 29 January to propose a set of narrow-scope amendments to IFRS S2.
The amendments cover the following:
disclosing Scope 3 Category 15 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (i.e. GHG emissions that arise from a company’s financial investments);
using alternative global warming potential (GWP) values;
applying the jurisdictional relief to use a method other than the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard to measure GHG emissions; and
using the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) when disaggregating financed emissions by industry.
The proposed amendments are particularly relevant for companies with insurance or investment banking activities. They will also be of interest to companies that are currently planning their implementation or have already conducted a gap assessment.

What changes are being proposed?

The ISSB is proposing the following changes to IFRS S2.
Area What's proposed? What's the impact?
Disclosing Scope 3 Category 15 GHG emissions
For more information, see Financed and facilitated emissions
Limit the disclosure of Scope 3 Category 15 GHG emissions to financed emissions as defined in IFRS S2 and specifically exclude derivatives. IFRS S2 defines financed emissions as ‘the portion of gross greenhouse gas emissions of an investee or counterparty attributed to the loans and investments made by an entity to the investee or counterparty’.
Require a company to provide information about what was excluded.
A company would not need to include the following emissions in its total Scope 3 emissions, even if they are material:
derivatives;
investment banking activities;
underwriting activities in the insurance and reinsurance industry (insurance-associated emissions); and
other Category 15 GHG emissions that are not financed emissions.
The relief would not be time-bound, but the ISSB may reconsider its decision at a future date if circumstances change – e.g. if there are changes to the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard1 affecting Scope 3 Category 15 emissions.
There would be no change to the requirement for all types of companies – e.g. insurers – to disclose financed emissions, if material.
Using alternative GWP values in certain circumstances Allow a company to use the GWP values required by its local regulator or stock exchange instead of GWP values from the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessment.
A company would no longer have to use two sets of GWP values – one to meet IFRS S2 requirements and the other to meet local jurisdictional needs.
Irrespective of the proposals, a company would still be required to disclose the measurement approach, inputs and assumptions it has used to measure its GHG emissions which would include explaining:
the GWP values used; and
if necessary, why it has not used the GWP values from the latest IPCC assessment.
The relief would be available as long as the regulator or stock exchange requires the company to use alternative GWP values.
Relief from using a method other than the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard to measure GHG emissions Clarify the circumstances in which a company can use the jurisdictional relief that applies if a method other than the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard is required by a local regulator or stock exchange.
A parent entity applying IFRS S2 would be permitted to consolidate information from a part of its group, that is prepared using a different measurement method for GHG emissions (as required by its local regulator or stock exchange). The parent is also permitted to continue using a different method for its entire group if that method is mandated by its jurisdiction.
The proposals would reduce duplicate reporting for companies with subsidiaries in jurisdictions with different GHG emissions measurement requirements.
Using the GICS when disaggregating financed emissions by industry
Introduce a hierarchy to explain which classification system to use for lending and investment activities.
a) If a company is currently using GICS somewhere in the group, they would use it for the whole group.
b) If the company is not currently using GICS within its group and is required by a local regulator or stock exchange to use an alternative industry-classification system for other reporting purposes, then it would use that alternative classification system.
c) If neither (a) nor (b) apply, the company can choose an industry-classification system to provide information in a manner that is useful to investors.
Under this hierarchy, if a company is using more than one industry-classification system, the proposals would require that it chooses one classification system – prioritising a system that is used for:
climate-related reporting; and then
other reporting purposes.
Require a company to disclose the industry-classification system it is using and if it is not GICS, then explain the basis for selecting the alternative classification system.
A company would be able to use its existing industry-classification system instead of GICS in specific circumstances when providing disaggregated information about its financed emissions.
The proposals would be particularly beneficial for companies that are already required to use a different classification system for prudential regulatory reporting, or those that for various reasons already, use a different system to GICS.

What’s next?

The ISSB plans to release an exposure draft for public consultation in Q2 2025 for a 60-day comment period. The board intends to finalise the amendments during 2025 and propose an effective date as soon as possible (e.g. 1 January 2026, with early adoption permitted) to ensure that companies have time to adjust systems and avoid unnecessary work as they continue to implement the standards.

Actions for management – Have your say when the consultation opens

Understand the ISSB's proposals and how they affect your company.
Be ready to update your gap assessment if already completed, or ensure the proposed changes are considered as you perform your gap assessment.
Consider whether planned changes would be required to your systems, processes and controls.
Remember that these proposals are intended to simplify, but not remove requirements. Financed emissions disclosures are still required for companies such as insurers.

Frameworks begin applying
The final months of 2024 saw major advances of cryptoasset regulatory frameworks in the EU and UK. After years of deliberation, the EU’s landmark package of reform the Markets in Cryptoassets Regulation (MiCAR) – is now live. This will soon be complemented by a permanent prudential regime for relevant exposures in credit institutions. The UK, which has consistently remained a second — mover, has now laid out a clear timeline for its own next steps. Specifically, the first of several expected discussion papers — on trading disclosures and market abuse – has been issued.

EU developments

The remaining elements of the Markets in Cryptoassets Regulation (MiCAR)
opens in a new tab
began applying from 30 December 2024. A transitional regime
opens in a new tab
embedded within MiCAR grants cryptoasset services providers (CASPs) additional time until 1 July 2026 to transition from existing national frameworks. However, certain Member States have opted to disapply or reduce this timeframe, resulting in a patchwork
opens in a new tab
of different durations to be navigated. Firms that do become authorised under MiCAR will also need to comply with the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA)
opens in a new tab
that went live earlier in January.
The implementation date for the BIS’s prudential standards for bank cryptoasset exposures has been deferred by one year until 1 January 2026. Despite push-back from industry, these standards require “unbacked cryptoassets and stablecoins with ineffective stabilisation mechanisms” to be subject to the highest possible one-for-one capital charges. There is also an overall limit on banks’ exposures to these types of assets.
To address this within the EU, the CRR3
opens in a new tab
had already introduced a transitional capital regime, applicable from July 2024. However, the EBA has now also launched a consultation
opens in a new tab
further developing this capital treatment for various types of risk (credit risk, CCR, market risk and CVA risk) and seeking to align it more closely to the BIS. The consultation proposes specific risk weights – 250% for Asset-Referenced Tokens (ARTs) (to reflect their partial backing by traditional assets) and 1,250% for unbacked cryptoassets (to account for their volatility and “lack of intrinsic value”).
EIOPA has also published a consultation
opens in a new tab
on equivalent capital requirements for insurers. Despite current cryptoasset exposures remaining immaterial (0.0068% of European insurers’ total investments), EIOPA is proposing a 100% haircut to any holdings – regardless of their balance sheet treatment and investment structure.

UK developments

Recent research
opens in a new tab
from the FCA shows that crypto ownership in the UK continues to rise, with 12% of adults now owning these assets. More interestingly, a third of respondents incorrectly believe they could seek recourse with the FCA if something went wrong.
Since coming to power in July 2024, the Labour government has reiterated
opens in a new tab
its intention of proceeding with majority of plans brought forward by the previous Cabinet. In short, a number of new cryptoasset regulated activities will be created based on equivalents in traditional finance. However, this work will now be combined into a single phase, rather than addressing stablecoins separately. And proposals
opens in a new tab
to include stablecoins within UK payment regulations have been scrapped — due to lack of a viable ‘use case’.
To progress these plans, the latest FCA Roadmap
opens in a new tab
indicates that 2025 will be a year of consultations, with final policy statements to follow in 2026. The first Discussion Paper in the series — DP24/4
opens in a new tab
 on Admissions & Disclosures and the Market Abuse Regime — came out just before Christmas and aligns closely with the original HMT proposals

. 
Key highlights include:

With regards to a prudential framework, unlike the EU, until recently the UK was yet to make any progress.  However, the BoE has now published a request for information
opens in a new tab
on firms’ cryptoasset exposures – noting that this will be used to inform the calibration of their approach.
The government has announced plans to issue a digital gilt (DIGIT) within the recently-launched Digital Securities Sandbox

.
Clarification has been made that cryptoasset staking does not constitute a Collective Investment Scheme – by introducing a Statutory Instrument
opens in a new tab
before parliament.
The Law Commission’s draft Property (Digital Assets) Bill
opens in a new tab
is currently being considered by the House of Lords. This Bill would confirm the existence of a “third” category of personal property, into which certain digital assets could fall, thereby giving investors increased legal protection.
And, the BoE have issued a progress update

and blueprint design note
opens in a new tab
on a prospective digital pound, after entering the ‘design phase’ back in January 2024. The decision of whether or not to actually issue a digital pound remains several years out – and could only come via new primary legislation.

What does this mean for firms?

Firms should firstly ensure that they have designed an appropriate regulatory authorisation strategy — i.e., identifying optimal jurisdictions in which to establish themselves. This should include considerations around transitioning from any relevant temporary regimes towards full authorisation. The strategy should also consider the connection to any wider operational resilience frameworks (e.g., DORA).
Firms can also begin building their capabilities around the preparation of trading admissions documentation—this is already required under MiCAR and will soon be required under the upcoming UK regime.
And firms can explore technological options to meet market abuse requirements. Regulators, particularly in the UK, have emphasised their support for the use of potential industry-led solutions.

How KPMG in the UK can help

Companies in scope need to get ready now for enhanced sustainability reporting, as the European Commission (EC) has published the final text of its first set of twelve European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS). For the first wave of companies, disclosures will be required as early as the 2024 reporting period.
Companies will need to assess which topics to report using the double materiality concept, which requires information that is material from either a financial perspective or an impact perspective. Companies will also need to include information from their value chain.
It is important to engage now to understand the requirements of this first set of ESRS and to assess how your company needs to adapt.

Key features of the final ESRS

The ESRS set out detailed reporting requirements for companies in the scope of the CSRD1. Two cross-cutting standards provide general reporting concepts and include overarching disclosure requirements including multiple datapoints. Ten topical standards complement these with detailed disclosure requirements across environmental, social and governance topics. Together, these 12 ESRS require companies to provide information on:
their governance and strategy to address material sustainability topics;
the impacts, risks and opportunities arising from those topics; and
quantitative metrics and targets.
                           Key features of the final ESRS
Double materiality principles
Double materiality refers to two dimensions of materiality – ‘financial’ and ‘impact’.
Companies will need to perform materiality assessments for both dimensions and report matters that are material in either dimension for all sustainability-related topics.
Reporting across a broad range of topics
ESRS require disclosures on material impacts, risks and opportunities across a broad range of environmental, social and governance topics. 
Following a materiality assessment, companies need to ensure they have the data, processes and expertise to report on topics that may be new to them, such as biodiversity or the circular economy.
Governance
Companies need to clearly set out their governance of how they address sustainability-related topics, including how sustainability key performance indicators (KPIs) affect remuneration. 
Reporting at the same time as the financial statements
Companies in scope will prepare a sustainability statement including the disclosures required by the ESRS as part of their management report, published at the same time as the financial statements.
It will be challenging for many companies to gather data in time.
Reporting on impacts, risks and opportunities across the value chain
The standards require companies to identify and report on impacts, risks and opportunities from across the value chain.
Companies need to understand how this feature will impact their reporting and data gathering, even though the extent of data required from the value chain has reduced since the original drafts, and phase-in reliefs are available.
Reporting on policies, action plans and targets
Companies need to be ready for the transparency of providing granular disclosures about their policies, action plans and targets across all material topics. 
While the standards themselves do not require companies to put in place new targets or implement new policies, the standards will bring greater visibility and scrutiny of their plans. Undertaking an implementation project therefore represents an opportunity to identify and address areas where companies are less mature than they would want to be.
Assurance
Companies need to be prepared for disclosures to be subject to assurance. 
This will require a clear audit trail and documentation of processes and controls to support the disclosures provided.
 For further detail on the ESRS, see our high-level visual overview.

Key changes compared with prior versions

The proposed standards were exposed for comment at key stages over the past 15 months. The basic principles have been retained – such as using double materiality principles and requiring reporting from across the value chain on a broad range of topics. However, the structure has changed to align more closely with the TCFD and some requirements have been simplified, removed or made voluntary compared with earlier versions.
   Key changes compared with prior versions
Material and mandatory disclosures
Under the first set of ESRS, only ESRS 2 General disclosures includes mandatory disclosure requirements. A list of mandatory disclosure requirements (i.e. disclosures not subject to materiality assessment) has been removed, in particular related to ESRS E1 Climate change and ESRS S1 Own workforce. They are now all subject to a materiality assessment. However, when companies conclude that ESRS E1 is not material, they will provide a detailed explanation of their conclusion. 
Financial companies need certain datapoints to meet disclosure requirements under other EU law, for example SFDR3. If companies conclude that such datapoints are not material, then they need to make an explicit statement for each datapoint.
EFRAG2 is currently developing additional guidance on how companies can perform the double materiality assessment. 
Phase-in reliefs
To give companies, especially smaller companies, more time to implement the data collection and reporting processes, the first set of ESRS introduces relief measures for one, two or three years. 
All companies, regardless of size, may opt out of disclosing the expected financial impacts related to risks from environmental issues for the first year of reporting. Companies can provide qualitative disclosure only on these financial impacts for a further two years.
Additionally, certain disclosures related to own workforce (social protection, people with disabilities, work-related illnesses and work-life balance) can be omitted in the first year of reporting.
Companies with less than 750 employees may also omit:
the disclosure of Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions (ESRS E1) and other disclosures on their own workforce (ESRS S1) in the first reporting year; and
the disclosures on biodiversity (ESRS E4 Biodiversity and ecosystems), workers in the value chain (ESRS S2 Workers in the value chain), affected communities (ESRS S3 Affected communities) and consumers (ESRS S4 Consumers and end-users) in the first two reporting years.
Voluntary disclosure requirements
Some data points were labelled as voluntary in the drafts prepared by EFRAG. The EC has made additional disclosure requirements or data points voluntary, for example:
biodiversity transition plans;
certain indicators on 'non-employees' in the company's workforce; and
an explanation of why the company has deemed a particular sustainability topic (i.e. the disclosure requirements of a topic-specific standard as a whole) to be non-material.

Interoperability with international standard-setting initiatives

The CSRD requires the EC and EFRAG to take 'account, to the greatest extent possible, of the work of global standard-setting initiatives'. Both have worked with the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) and the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) to increase interoperability.
The ISSB and EFRAG have published a detailed, bottom-up analysis of the climate-related disclosure requirements in IFRS S2 Climate-related disclosures and corresponding requirements in ESRS 1 General Requirements, ESRS 2 and ESRS E1.

As Laurent Gobbi, Global Tech Risk Leader, KPMG in France, explains, “The key trends I see in the technology space are automation, compliance and organizational changes. Automation because you need to replace manual tasks, compliance because you have more regulation coming and organizational changes because companies will have to adapt very quickly; you can't adopt these technologies effectively within a traditional business model.”

A complex, multi-layered technology stack presents a huge challenge, with many new, fragmented, cloud-based components coming onto the market, a constant stream of academic paper fueling those technologies, and concerns over the safety, reliability and ethics of AI models and their use. Few if any organizations have the expertise to manage such complexity. Setting up your technology for success means coping with fragmentation and multiple suppliers and somehow bringing all these pieces together.
Misaligned technology and business goals. Technology investment is not only complex; it’s also very expensive and therefore a major commitment. If those responsible for making technology choices are not closely in tune with other parts of the organization, then the platforms, solutions and AI may not support the business goals for innovation, productivity and insights.
Data security and privacy are a big concern, given the increasing volumes of intellectual property and personal data held by companies, and the ongoing battle with cyber criminals, hackers and bad actors. Ethical use of AI is also under scrutiny, to protect citizens’ rights. Without the right technology checks and balances, companies can be subject to regulatory penalties, which can damage their reputation and deter investors and consumers.
Lack of talent can hold back technology adoption and prevent companies from making the most of the enormous potential of AI and cloud solutions. The speed of innovation calls for a regular flow of new graduates knowledgeable in the very latest technologies; a narrow and finite pipeline that is not growing to satisfy demand.

Three steps to improve your tech risk function

Don’t let technology risks undermine opportunities

With technological developments moving so quickly, companies can’t afford to fall behind competitors. At the same time, they can't risk making expensive investment mistakes; nor can they put their reputations on the line through unethical use of AI and/or cybersecurity.
Companies are advised to seek expert guidance and resources to navigate the complexities of technology risk and embrace the opportunities presented by AI.

Go back to the Euro Tax Flash homepage.

On December 19, 2024, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU or the Court) rendered its decision in case C-601/23
opens in a new tab
. The case concerns the compatibility of the Spanish dividend withholding tax with EU law.
The Court found that Spain’s withholding tax rules, which treat the withholding tax on dividends as a prepayment of CIT for resident companies (which can be reimbursed in the event of tax losses), but as a final levy for non-resident companies in similar circumstances, constitute an unjustified restriction on the free movement of capital.

CJEU – Spain – Withholding tax on dividends – Reimbursement of withholding tax – Free movement of capital – Comparability

Background

Case C-601/23 concerns a UK-based company with no permanent establishment in Spain (the Plaintiff) that received a dividend of EUR 2.7 million from a company based in the Basque Country (Biscay). The payment was initially subject to a withholding tax rate of 19 percent but ultimately reduced to 10 percent under the Spain-UK double tax treaty.
Based on Spanish legislation applicable at the time, the withholding tax levied represented a final tax for non-resident companies, with no available mechanism for reimbursement in the event that the recipient sustained losses in the relevant tax year. On the other hand, for a resident company subject to corporate income tax (CIT) in Biscay, the withholding tax constituted an advance payment on account of CIT, which only gave rise to the actual levying of the tax if that company has a positive tax base for the tax year in question. If the tax base was negative, the tax withheld would be reimbursed.
The Plaintiff argued that, as a loss-making company, it was unable to offset the tax withheld in Spain against its tax liabilities in the UK. In light of the difference in treatment compared to a local resident, the Plaintiff therefore argued that the impossibility to obtain a refund of the WHT paid was a breach of the free movement of capital guaranteed by Article 63 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (“TFEU”).
The High Court of Justice of the Basque Country expressed doubts on whether the tax treatment of non-resident companies was compatible with EU law and referred the case to the CJEU for clarification.

CJEU decision

Admissibility
First with respect to the admissibility of the case, the CJEU recalled that, in principle, it is bound to give a ruling where the question submitted concerns the interpretation or the validity of a rule of EU law, unless it is obvious that the interpretation sought bears no relation to the actual facts of the main proceedings or its purpose, where the problem is hypothetical, or where the CJEU does not have the information necessary to give a useful answer to that question. Since none of these conditions applied in the present case, the request for a preliminary ruling was deemed admissible.
Existence of a restriction of the EU free movement of capital
The CJEU assessed the existence of a restriction of the free movement of capital under Article 63 TFEU. In that regard, the CJEU recalled that a less favorable treatment by a Member State of dividends paid to non-resident companies, compared to the treatment of dividends paid to resident companies in a comparable situation, may deter companies established in other Member States to invest in companies in the first Member State and may consequently lead to a restriction of the free movement of capital.
In that respect, the CJEU noted that the Spanish rules may lead to an advantage for resident loss making companies. Dividends received by resident companies would be included in the assessment for corporate income tax, and in case of tax losses, taxation would be carried forward until a next positive financial year, which leads, at the very least, to a cash-flow advantage, or even an exemption if the company does not achieve any positive results in the future. Non-resident entities, on the other hand, are subject to immediate and definitive taxation, irrespective of their results. The CJEU therefore ruled that the Spanish tax rules, which treat the withholding tax on dividends as a payment on account of CIT for resident companies (which can be reimbursed in the event of tax losses), but as a final levy for non-resident companies in similar circumstances, lead to a difference in treatment.
The Court also rejected Spain’s plea that the withholding tax rate applicable under the Spain – UK double tax treaty is lower (i.e., 10 percent) as compared to the general CIT rate applicable to dividends paid to resident entities, once included in the company’s CIT base (i.e., 28 percent at the time). In the CJEU’s view, this distinction does not mitigate the less favorable treatment applied to dividends paid to non-resident companies that are loss-making.
Moreover, the CJEU recalled that a restriction of a fundamental freedom cannot be regarded as compatible with EU law on the grounds of a potential existence of other advantages, nor on the ground that legislation does not discriminate between non-residents and residents in other situations.
The Court held that this difference in treatment of dividends according to the place of residence of the dividend receiving companies, which favors resident companies, may deter non-resident companies from investing in companies established in Biscay, and constitutes a restriction on the free movement of capital under Article 63 TFEU.
Existence of a justification for the restriction
The CJEU then assessed the existence of a justification for the restriction. The Court noted that it is settled case-law that a difference in treatment is only compatible with the free movement of capital if it concerns situations that are not objectively comparable or where it can be justified by an overriding reason in the public interest.
On the latter point, the CJEU held that the difference in treatment resulting from the rules at issue concerns situations that are objectively comparable. In that regard, the CJEU recalled that, once a Member State, either unilaterally or by way of a convention, levies a tax from both resident and non-resident taxpayers on the income from dividends received from a resident company, the situation of those non-resident taxpayers becomes comparable to that of resident taxpayers. This finding also applies to the present case.
The Provincial Council of Biscay argued that the difference in treatment could be justified by one of the following overriding reasons in the public interest:
the effective collection of tax;
the balanced allocation of the power of taxation between Member States and preventing the risk of losses being used twice;
maintaining the cohesion of the tax system.
The CJEU rejected the argument that the difference in treatment is justified by the effective collection of tax. The Court recalled that the restriction lies in the fact that, unlike loss-making resident companies, non-resident loss-making companies benefit neither from reimbursement of the withholding tax, nor from a potential deferral of taxation. In the Court’s view, granting such a benefit to non-resident companies would eliminate the restriction and it would not undermine the achievement of the aim of the effective collection of tax.
The CJEU also denied the argument on the balanced allocation of the taxing rights between Member States and on preventing the risk of losses being used twice. The CJEU noted in that regard that, based on settled case-law, a Member State cannot rely on the preservation of a balanced allocation of taxing rights between Member States as a justification for the choice not to tax resident companies on domestic dividends, while taxing non-resident companies which receive such income. Furthermore, the CJEU noted that deferring the dividend withholding tax of loss-making non-resident companies, would not require the source Member State to waive its right to tax such income, but rather only defers such taxation until the non-resident entity becomes profitable in a subsequent year. With regard to the risk of losses being used twice, it is for the non-resident companies to provide proof to enable the tax authorities of the taxing Member State, to determine that the conditions to benefit from a deferral of taxation have been met.
Finally, the CJEU also rejected the argument based on maintaining the coherence of the tax system, as this requires the existence of a direct link between the tax advantage concerned and the offsetting of that advantage by a tax levy, which was not established in this case.
Consequently, the CJEU ruled that Article 63 TFEU precludes legislation under which dividends are subject to a withholding tax, where for resident companies the withholding tax on dividends serve a payment on account of CIT and is reimbursed in full if that company incurs losses in the respective financial year, whilst non-resident companies in a similar situation receive no reimbursement.

ETC Comment

The CJEU decision is broadly in line with its previous case law on the taxation of outbound dividends.
This ruling opens the door for refund claims regarding withholding tax levied in Spain. Non-resident companies that were subject to withholding tax in Spain during open audit periods and that suffered tax losses during those fiscal years could now be entitled to a refund based on the principle of the free movement of capital and the ECJ’s decision.

https://kpmg.com/xx/en/our-insights/risk-and-regulation/regulatory-regimes-for-esg-ratings-providers.html,Risk and Regulation,Regulatory regimes for ESG ratings providers,,"January 2025

It is just over 12 months since the launch of the UK Code of Conduct
opens in a new tab
for ESG Ratings and Data Products Providers. A year on, regulators in both the EU and UK have responded to shortcomings and risks in the transparency and integrity of ESG ratings and have now also developed formal regulatory approaches. The analysis below looks at how the two regimes have been structured and considers how they will impact providers and users of ratings.
The European Commission first published proposals to regulate ESG ratings providers in 2023 and the resulting Regulation on the transparency and integrity of ESG rating activities
opens in a new tab
has now been published in the Official Journal of the European Union. The rules will apply from July 2026.
In the UK, HM Treasury (HMT) also put forward proposals in 2023 on regulating the activities of ESG ratings providers and has now published its response to the consultation
opens in a new tab
alongside a draft statutory instrument
opens in a new tab
. Once these have been considered by Parliament, it will be for the FCA to develop and consult on specific requirements for in-scope providers, with the government estimating that the  entire process from design to applicability could take up to four years, subject to the volume of applications for authorisation.
Both regimes recognise that ESG ratings play an important role in global capital markets and consequently address the need for them to be independent, comparable where possible, transparent and of adequate quality. The EU regime has progressed faster, and in-scope firms must now assess how the rules will affect their business models and take appropriate action to comply with the final requirements – although some detail is still to be published by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) in regulatory technical standards (RTS).
For firms likely to be captured by the UK regime, although final rules are yet to be published by the FCA, HMT has provided enough information for them to begin to assess the likely impacts. The FCA continues to encourage firms to sign up to the industry Code of Conduct
opens in a new tab
, which has also been leveraged by Hong Kong (SAR), China to develop its code. Other countries such as Singapore & Japan have introduced their own codes of conduct, indicating the appetite for transparency and integrity in the ESG ratings market.

What is an ESG ratings provider?

HMT’s draft definition of an ESG ratings provider for regulatory purposes is ‘an assessment regarding one or more ESG factors, produced in the form of an ESG opinion, an ESG score or a combination of both, whether or not it is characterised as an ESG rating’. ESG opinions include an ESG rating where there has been substantial analytical input from an analyst, regardless of whether the opinion is formally characterised as a ‘rating’. Additionally, an ESG score refers to a rating that has been derived from data and a pre-established statistical or algorithmic model.
The EU has carved out a similar definition, with the final rules defining a system ‘that is based on both an established methodology and a defined ranking system of rating categories, irrespective of whether such ESG rating is labelled as “ESG rating”, “ESG opinion” or “ESG score”.’

Overview of the proposed regulatory requirements

The EU regime introduces specific requirements on the general principles of ESG ratings providers’ operation, disclosure of their data and methodologies, and their governance and organisational structure. The regime regulates the issuance, distribution and publication of ESG ratings, not the intended use of them.
Similarly, HMT intends for the regulatory regime to promote transparency, good governance, manage conflicts of interest, and introduce robust systems and controls. Like the EU, ‘the regulated activity would be the direct provision of an assessment’, i.e. regulate the provision rather than the use of ESG ratings.

Implications for users of ratings and ratings providers

Users of ESG ratings will welcome the additional robustness that the EU rules introduce. However, for ratings providers the new regimes may result in a significant uplift in their regulatory requirements, and in-scope firms will need to understand how they might be affected. This could include needing to seek authorisation, compliance with the EU’s general principles on the integrity and reliability of ESG ratings activities, and implementation of robust governance requirements. They will also need to comply with numerous disclosure requirements and may therefore benefit from considering how to leverage existing systems to gather the disclosure metrics. ‘Readiness assessments’ can help to establish overall preparedness for the new regime.
In the UK, HMT has signalled a similar trajectory and emphasised alignment with the IOSCO recommendations on ESG ratings. UK firms may benefit from conducting a ‘no regrets’ analysis to assess their readiness for future authorisation, covering transparency, good governance, managing conflicts of interests and robust systems and controls. 
In the EU, ESMA, not the National Competent Authorities, will authorise and be the primary supervisor for ESG ratings providers. Where firms do not comply with the requirements, it may take the following supervisory measures:
Suspending or withdrawing the authorisation or recognition of the ESG rating provider
Temporarily prohibiting the ESG rating provider from publishing or distributing ESG ratings, until the infringement has been resolved
Requiring the ESG rating provider to bring the infringement to an end
Imposing fines
Issuing public notices
ESMA will develop draft RTS on areas such as information to be provided in the application for authorisation and recognition, measures and safeguards on the separation of business and activities, and disclosure of methodologies, models and assumptions.
Supervisory measures and penalties in the UK will become clearer once the FCA publishes its consultation paper.

How KPMG in the UK can help

KPMG’s ESG Data and Risk and Regulatory Assurance teams are well-placed to support financial institutions on a range of activities relating to the evolving ESG data and ratings landscape, for example:
Regulatory readiness assessments of ESG ratings providers’ business activities against the relevant requirements.
Remediation and implementation of enhancements required to meet the relevant requirements, including ratings entity design, governance structures and data controls.
Preparation and submission of regulatory applications for the authorisation of ESG ratings providers.
Provision of ESG Rating Assurance for use with ratings clients and users against either the Code of Conduct or future EU and UK regulatory obligations.

Banking

Strong and Simple — The PRA has now published PS19/24
opens in a new tab
on rules relating to the definition of an Interim Capital Regime (ICR) firm, which were previously issued as ‘near final’ in PS17/23
opens in a new tab
and PS9/24
opens in a new tab
. PS19/24 outlines the mechanism by which firms can join the ICR and thereby remain under the current capital regime in the period between implementation of the Basel 3.1 standards (1 January 2026) and the new capital regime for Small Domestic Deposit Takers (SDDTs).
BoE approach to stress testing — The BoE has also published its updated approach
opens in a new tab
to stress testing the UK banking system from 2025 onwards. A Bank Capital Test will now be carried out every other year, replacing the annual cyclical scenario exercises. In the intervening years, supplementary stress testing (e.g., desk — based exercises) will be used where appropriate. Exploratory exercises will continue to be used as a means of assessing other risks, such as structural and emerging risks. The approach has been updated to reflect the material increase in levels of bank capital since the global financial crisis and the evolving nature of risks.
RAF reporting and disclosure dates — After consulting on changes to the reporting and disclosure dates for the UK Resolvability Assessment Framework (RAF), the PRA has confirmed that the timing of future submissions will no longer be fixed to two — year cycles. Instead, they will be on a periodic basis, with the next two reporting dates set for the first Friday in October 2026 and the second Friday in June 2027.

Insurance

PRA supervisory priorities — The PRA has published
opens in a new tab
its annual 'Dear CEO' supervisory priorities letter for insurers. The priorities for 2025 are: Solvency UK implementation and other policy reforms, bulk purchase annuity (BPA) market developments including funded reinsurance, cyclicality in the general insurance market, life insurance stress test, liquidity resilience, solvent exit planning, operational resilience, and climate change. Two new elements are the confirmation the PRA is going ahead with the Matching Adjustment Investment Accelerator and an upcoming consultation in H2, jointly with the FCA, on policy relating to management of ICT and cyber risks. 
PRA postpones Dynamic General Insurance Stress Test — The PRA has announced
opens in a new tab
the postponement of the dynamic general insurance stress test (DyGIST) launch. This exploratory exercise, which is designed to assess both industry resilience and risk management and inform our supervisory response following an adverse scenario, is now expected to commence in May 2026. Recognising the burden on certain firms of carrying out two stress tests (the life and general insurance stress test exercises) in the same year, the PRA intends to carry out these exercises in alternate calendar years going forward. The PRA will now engage with the industry on DyGIST from September 2025.
Solvent exit planning for insurers — The PRA has finalised its policy on solvent exit planning for insurers, releasing PS20/24
opens in a new tab
and SS11/24
opens in a new tab
. Insurers must produce a solvent exit analysis (SEA) highlighting, amongst other things, solvent exit actions, indicators and potential barriers and risks. They are also expected to produce a solvent exit execution plan (SEEP) when there is a reasonable prospect that the firm may need to execute a solvent exit. Key changes to the final policy include removal of the one — month timing expectation for the solvent exit execution plan (SEEP), exclusion of Lloyd’s managing agents from the scope and a delayed implementation date of 30 June 2026 (previously Q4 2025). For more information, see the article above.
PRA consultation on liquidity reporting — The PRA is consulting (CP19/24
opens in a new tab
) on significantly enhancing liquidity reporting for large insurers. This comes after recent market stresses identified ‘critical gaps’ in liquidity reporting to the PRA, hampering supervisors’ ability to assess firms’ liquidity exposure and responses in a stress scenario. The new rules are a step change in expectations for impacted firms and are expected to come into effect on 31 December 2025. For more information, see the article above.
PRA proposes to streamline standard formula reporting — Also in CP19/24
opens in a new tab
, the PRA proposes to remove the requirement for all life firms with full or partial internal models to submit annual Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR) information calculated using the Standard Formula (SF). While the formal application date for this change is 31 December 2025, the PRA is enabling immediate application of the benefits via a temporary delay in submission deadline for firms’ YE2024 SF SCR. To note, this only applies to life firms – general and composite insurers will need to continue to submit the relevant template (SF.01) for the PRA to monitor model drift.
Correction to standard formula mass lapse life underwriting risk rule — The PRA has announced
opens in a new tab
a correction to PS15/24, concerning the standard formula mass lapse life underwriting risk rule. It has concluded that the reference to Regulated Activities Order (RAO) class III in rule SCR — SF 3B6.6(1) is in fact an error. The correct restatement should only require firms to apply a 70% stress for mass lapse life underwriting risk to RAO class VII(a) and class VII(b) business, not class III, where the additional requirements in the rule are met.

Capital Markets and Asset Management

Reforming the PRIIPs and UCITS disclosure regimes (CP 24/30) — The FCA has set out detailed proposals
opens in a new tab
for revamping disclosures required for retail investment products. The proposals would modernise and fundamentally change how firms provide information to customers, both in terms of content and format. Importantly, the FCA envisages less prescription and standardisation, other than in certain, specific areas, and aims to provide a simpler and more flexible approach for firms in terms of how, what and when they communicate with retail customers. The FCA will publish final rules later this year with a transition period to allow time for firms to adjust. A separate consultation on related changes to existing FCA handbooks and on the transition period will follow early in 2025.
MiFID Org Regulation — The FCA is consulting
opens in a new tab
on proposals to transfer the rules in the MiFID Org Regulation into its handbook to coincide with its repeal by HMT. The FCA proposes to retain the substance of the requirements, providing continuity for firms. However, there is an interesting section that invites views on reforms for updating, simplifying or better tailoring the rules the UK market. The consultation follows HMT's policy paper on reforming the UK’s MiFID framework, published as part of announcements made around the Mansion House speech.
Consolidated tape (CT) updates — The FCA has started the process
opens in a new tab
of appointing a bond CT provider with the publication of a concession notice
opens in a new tab
setting out steps for running the tender process. The FCA aims to ensure that data on bond transactions, such as prices and volumes, executed on venue as well as over — the — counter, can be accessed in a cost effective way. The FCA has also published an independent report
opens in a new tab
on the potential impacts of implementing a pre — trade equities consolidated tape (CT) in the UK and concludes
opens in a new tab
that most market participants think there is a strong case for a CT with post — trade equities data although there are some concerns about including pre — trade data. It will now assess four different policy options with industry before consulting formally later in the 2025.
PISCES — the FCA is consulting
opens in a new tab
on the regulatory framework for the Private Intermittent Securities and Capital Exchange System (PISCES), a new type of trading platform that will enable intermittent trading of private company shares using market infrastructure. PISCES will be established under the FMI Sandbox and will initially run for five years allowing the FCA to update the regime as it learns from its operation. PISCES will be for secondary trading only for institutional and professional investors, plus a limited subset of retail investors. There will be a tailored disclosure regime and UK MAR and transactions reporting requirements will not apply.
Benchmark Administrators — The FCA has published its third portfolio strategy letter
opens in a new tab
to benchmark administrators. Supervisory focus areas are: corporate governance & oversight, data quality controls, benchmark controls, disclosures and operational resilience. The FCA is planning multi — firm reviews on governance, data input controls and the adequacy of end — to end benchmarks controls.
Contracts for Difference (CFD) providers — The FCA’s supervisory strategy
opens in a new tab
for CFD providers focuses on: Consumer Duty, market integrity, reducing harm from firm failure, reducing the number of 'halo' firms, managing the risks of firms diversifying their product offerings, distributors and appointed representatives (ARs), and operational resilience and outsourcing. The FCA plans to conduct a multi — firm review focusing on the Duty’s ‘price and value’ outcome, considering whether firms are able to demonstrate consideration and delivery of fair value in areas including spreads, overnight funding charges and commissions.
Data reporting services providers (DRSPs) — The FCA has published its second supervisory strategy letter
opens in a new tab
to firms providing the data reporting services of Approved Reporting Mechanisms (ARMs) and Approved Publication Arrangements (APAs) — DRSPs. The FCA's supervisory priorities are operational resilience, data quality systems and controls, communication with the FCA and the notification regime, and effective implementation of regulatory change. The FCA will review DRSPs’ procedures for submitting notifications to the FCA, focused on ensuring that firms have clearly established and appropriate thresholds for determining when a notification is required.
Trading venues — The FCA’s supervisory strategy
opens in a new tab
for trading venues focuses on operational resilience, market orderliness, competition, innovation and growth, market reform and voluntary carbon markets. The FCA will review the implementation of operational resilience requirements and how venues are carrying out risk — sensitive member oversight and testing algorithmic trading to manage the risk of market volatility.
Custody and fund services supervisory strategy — The FCA has published its latest supervisory priorities
opens in a new tab
for custody banks, depositaries and third party administrators. The priorities are largely unchanged compared to the previous letter, published in March 2022, with significant focus on themes relating to resilience and continuity of service. Boards of firms in this portfolio should examine the detail in this latest letter closely and ensure that they are comfortable that the various points outlined by the FCA have been addressed.
Bank of England FMI supervision — The BoE’s consultation
opens in a new tab
on Fundamental Rules for FMIs is the first use of the BoE’s new power, under FSMA 2023, to make legally binding rules for UK CCPs and CSDs. The rules are similar to the FCA Principles of Business and the PRA's Fundamental Rules and will also apply to BoE — regulated UK payments systems and specified service providers. Concurrently, the BoE has updated
opens in a new tab
its 2013 Approach to FMI supervision which outlines how the BoE works with other regulators (both nationally and internationally), its FMI risk model, how it supervises FMIs that form part of groups, different types of supervisory activity and its approach to new firms and non — UK FMIs. It has also published its annual report
opens in a new tab
on its supervision of FMIs which outlines focus areas for 2025 including ongoing supervisory work on financial and operational resilience of FMIs, working with government to deliver the National Payments Visions, repealing and replacing UK EMIR for CCPs and supporting work to move to T+1 settlements.
2024 CCP Supervisory Stress Test Results — The BoE has published the results
opens in a new tab
of its third UK CCP Supervisory Stress Test. The test focused on credit stress testing and CCPs’ resilience to the combination of a severe market stress and the default of two or more members. The results confirm the resilience of each UK CCP to a stress scenario similar to the worst — ever historical stress, combined with the default of the two members that lead to the largest mutualised losses.
CCP resolution — FSMA 2023 gave the BoE power to direct UK CCPs to address impediments to resolvability. The BoE has now issued a statement of policy
opens in a new tab
outlining its approach and process for using this power. FSMA 2023 also introduced a new regime for resolving CCPs that are deemed to be failing or likely to fail. The regime consists of eight stabilisation options, one of which allows the BoE (as resolution authority) to ‘tear up’ (or terminate) one or more contracts cleared by the CCP in the affected clearing service. The BoE has also issued a final statement of policy
opens in a new tab
on its approach to determining commercially reasonable payments to clearing members whose contracts are subject to a statutory tear up in CCP resolution.

Payments

Amendments to Specific Direction 3 — The PSR is consulting
opens in a new tab
on proposed changes to Specific Direction 3 (SD3). SD3 sets the legal requirements for Pay.UK in procuring upgraded infrastructure for Faster Payments (FPS). The PSR proposes to remove the 1 July 2026 migration deadline and replace it with a new deadline that will not be before 2036. The PSR also proposes to include a regulatory ‘non — objection’ decision point around decisions to extend existing FP infrastructure contracts or enter into new ones. The PSR intends to consult on its changes to its 2021 Regulatory Framework to address risks to competition and innovation in Spring 2025.
Cross border interchange fees — The PSR has released
opens in a new tab
the final report of its market review into cross border interchange fees (IFs). The review finds that the high level of fees is harming businesses, highlighting a lack of competition and steep cost increases without justification. Since 2021, Mastercard and Visa have raised their cross — border interchange fees fivefold from 0.2% to 1.15% for debit cards and 0.3% to 1.5% for credit cards. To address the findings, the PSR is consulting
opens in a new tab
on proposals for an IF price cap. It proposes a phased implementation approach and a stage 1 price cap (should the phased approach be adopted) of 0.2%/0.3% debit and credit cards respectively (for outbound transactions). Stage 2 will establish a longer — term fee level.

Retail Conduct

Consumer Duty board report — The FCA has published
opens in a new tab
the findings of its Consumer Duty board report review, setting out examples of good and poor practice and its expectations. The best reports were well structured allowing boards to easily scrutinise the key elements of the Duty. Five features of a good board report were identified: an outcomes focus, strong customer type analysis, a clear production process, good data quality and a Duty culture focus. However, firms may be disappointed that the FCA has not been clearer about its expectations on specifics such as the structure and length of the report. For more on KPMG in the UK’s view on approaching, designing, building and executing the annual assessment report to align to FCA expectations see here.
Consumer Duty areas of focus — The FCA has published
opens in a new tab
its long — awaited Consumer Duty priority areas for 2024/25. Whilst the majority were well known, there are two new additions, (i) reviews of consumer finance digital journeys and (ii) clarity of foreign exchange (FX) pricing in payment services. The FCA has grouped all its initiatives into four areas: embedding the Duty, price and fair value, sector specific and benefits realisation. Perhaps demonstrating the relative infancy of firms’ embedding of the Duty, the last of these includes only one initiative — the FCA’s rule review.
Complaints and root cause analysis — The FCA has published
opens in a new tab
the findings of its review of firms’ complaints and root cause analysis (RCA), setting out good and poor practice observed. It found that firms have established processes for carrying out RCA of complaints management information, however, there are areas for improvement such as the need for more granular data analysis across different customer types, ensuring actions are taken based on RCA insights and measuring the impact of those actions. With the Consumer Duty at its heart, this publication forms part of the growing body of information outlining the FCA’s Duty expectations.
Bereavement handling — The FCA has published
opens in a new tab
findings from a review of insurers’ approaches to death claims. Although some firms provided additional support for claimants, many have more to do to meet expectations, particularly around the measurement, monitoring, and delivery of good service outcomes for customers. On average, firms took between 53 and 122 days to process an entire claim, 36 days for group life cover, 20 days for Over— 50 plans and 53 days for Whole of Life. However, measurement was inconsistent as few firms captured these figures. The FCA also identified failings relating to staff training, clarity of information about firm policies and the appropriateness of support to bereaved customers. The FCA has called on insurers to improve bereavement handling times by setting out best practice principles for firms to follow.
FCA supervisory strategy — credit reference and credit information portfolio: The FCA has written
opens in a new tab
to the CEOs of credit reference agencies (CRAs) and credit information service providers (CISPs) setting out its supervisory strategy for the next two years. It identifies five priority areas of focus — embedding the Consumer Duty, operational resilience, cyber resilience, financial resilience and the Credit Information Market Study (CIMS). The FCA emphasises the importance of high standards, particularly in relation to operational and cyber resilience. Whilst successfully embedding all aspects of the Duty is important, the FCA raises specific concerns surrounding consumer support and understanding and price and fair value for the portfolio. Following publication of the CIMS final report
opens in a new tab
, the FCA expects firms in the portfolio to support the delivery of the identified remedies.
Modernising the redress framework — The FCA and the FOS have issued
opens in a new tab
a joint call for input on modernising the redress system to improve outcomes, better identify and manage mass redress events and identify improvements that ensure consistency in their interpretation of regulatory requirements. The paper proposes short term options, to be achieved through rule changes, and long — term options requiring legislative or other change. Options include the reintroduction of a two — step complaints handling process to reduce FOS referral rates, changes permitting the FOS to decline poorly evidenced complaints submitted by professional representatives (PRs) and, in cases of mass redress events, the option for the FCA to pause DISP complaint handling requirements (an approach recently applied to motor finance discretionary commission complaints).
FOS case fees for professional representatives — The FOS has published
opens in a new tab
correspondence with the FCA Chair confirming its decision to introduce case fees for professional representatives (PRs) e.g. Law firms and CMCs. The implementation of this decision is subject to parliamentary approval of enabling legislation. The case fee approach is largely unchanged from the consultation with the only major change being the increase of FOS proposed case fees of £250 for PRs, reduced to £75 if the case is upheld, and, where a case is successfully upheld against a PR, the case fee for the respondent firm will be reduced by £175. In another change, the FOS will increase the number of free cases for PRs from three to ten. Timing of the change is subject to secondary legislation but the FOS considers that the fees could be applied from H1 2025.
FOS Strategic Plan 2025/2026 — The FOS is consulting
opens in a new tab
 on its plans for the next financial year. It has resolved to keep fees low despite predicting further increases in the demand for its services and will maintain case fees and levies at the reduced fee level set in 2024/25, estimating a saving of £70m for the industry compared to 2023/24. It intends to build on work to increase efficiencies and reduce the cost per case.
Financial inclusion Committee (FIC) — HMT has announced
opens in a new tab
a new committee, tasked with developing and implementing interventions to support financial inclusion. Bringing together representatives from the third sector, industry, the FCA and government, the committee will focus on digital inclusion and access to banking services, savings, insurance, affordable credit and problem debt, financial education and capability.
Super — complaint — lending to small businesses — The FCA has
opens in a new tab
published a statement on its findings on the use of personal guarantees (PGs) for business loans in response to a super — complaint from the Federation of Small Businesses. The review found that only a small percentage of regulated loans to small and medium — sized enterprises (SMEs) in the UK used PGs, and that there was no evidence of harm to guarantors. However, the FCA has identified two practices firms may wish to adopt to address the concerns raised — providing post — contractual information to guarantors and setting a minimum borrowing level below which PGs will not be required.
Mortgage Charter — The FCA has released
opens in a new tab
the latest data from firms signed up to the Government’s Mortgage Charter. Introduced in 2023, the Charter contains several measures aimed at providing extra support to customers with residential mortgages, with signatories representing approximately 90% of the mortgage market. Findings indicate that the Charter is going some way to deliver on its objectives with a minimum of 1.7 million mortgage holders benefitting from one or more of the options since its introduction.
Perimeter Report — The FCA has updated its regulatory perimeter report
opens in a new tab
. The report is relevant across financial services and is of fundamental importance as the perimeter defines what is, or is not, within the FCA's regulatory scope. Areas of focus or clarification include the boundary between warranty and insurance, concern that the discretionary trust structure is used for what should be classified as insurance and whether UK intermediaries carrying out activity on behalf of non — UK insurers may be breaching the UK regulatory perimeter

Cross Sector

Publication of SWES final report — The BoE has published the outcomes
opens in a new tab
of the first system — wide exploratory scenario (SWES) exercise. The report identified six key financial stability conclusions and associated next steps, relating to financial firms’ risk management and authorities’ policymaking and risk monitoring.
Enforcement transparency — The FCA is consulting
opens in a new tab
on updated proposals on enforcement transparency, following significant pushback from the industry and concerns from the government about the impact of the initial approach. Revisions include extending the notice period before an announcement from one to ten days to allow firms time to make representations, and an updated public interest test that explicitly considers the potential negative impact on a firm and the potential for an announcement to seriously disrupt public confidence. The FCA has also clarified that it will not make proactive announcements of investigations that are on — going when the proposals come into effect.
FCA five — year strategy — In a recent speech
opens in a new tab
, Emily Shepperd, FCA COO, outlined the FCA's new five — year strategy. There are four main themes: becoming a more efficient and effective regulator, tackling financial crime, building consumer resilience and supporting economic growth and innovation. To support the strategy, the FCA believes there needs to be a debate about appropriate risk appetite in the sector.
Financial Crime Guide update — The FCA has updated
opens in a new tab
its Financial Crime guide focusing on areas where firms wanted additional guidance to clarify FCA expectations. The changes also reflect insights from supervisory work on financial crime and corporate updates from recent publications.
FCA quarterly consultation paper 46 (CP 24/26) — The FCA has proposed
opens in a new tab
changes to various elements of its handbook across a wide range of regulations and topics including corrections and clarifications to the Sustainability Disclosure Requirements (SDR), consumer credit product sales data reporting, travel insurance signposting for consumers with pre — existing medical conditions, disapplying the compliance oversight SMF from insurance special purpose vehicles (ISPVs), updating references to the UK Corporate Governance Code and proposals for debt management firms to submit a CASS audit.

Pensions

Defined Benefit covenant guidance — TPR has published
opens in a new tab
updated covenant guidance for trustees of defined benefit (DB) pension schemes, aligned with the new DB funding code which came into force on 12 November 2024. The new guidance provides greater certainty on how TPR expects trustees to assess their employer covenant, embed good practice and encourage consistency across schemes. New elements look at areas including cash flow, reasonable affordability and covenant longevity. The guidance also features worked examples for covenant assessments that require the highest level of judgement from trustees. TPR expects trustees to use the guidance to review whether their existing covenant analysis is focused in the right areas and remains proportionate, especially where there has been a significant change in the scheme’s funding position in recent years.

Operational Resilience

Operational Incident and Third — Party Reporting: The FCA is consulting (CP24/28
opens in a new tab
) on reporting operational incidents and material third — party arrangements. The consultation, which closes in March, includes detailed reporting tables.

Digital Finance and Innovation

UK Cryptoasset regulation — The City Minister confirmed
opens in a new tab
that the government intends to proceed with the majority of existing plans for a regulatory regime for cryptoassets. However, actions around stablecoins and unbacked cryptoassets will now be combined into a single phase rather than being dealt with individually and there no longer appears to be a viable use case for bringing stablecoins within UK payment regulations.
FCA Crypto Roadmap — the FCA has issued a Crypto Roadmap
opens in a new tab
, outlining planned policy publications throughout 2025 and into early 2026. The first Discussion Paper in the series (DP24/4
opens in a new tab
) on Admissions & Disclosures and the Market Abuse Regime is now live and aligns closely with the original proposals. The Admissions & Disclosures section specifies requirements pertaining to liability, due diligence, conflicts of interest and reporting, while the Market Abuse section outlines a bespoke regime for cryptoassets based (as far as is feasible) on existing UK MAR.
Property (Digital Assets etc) Bill — The House of Lords has launched a call for evidence
opens in a new tab
regarding the Law Commission’s Property (Digital Assets etc) Bill. The Bill seeks to confirm the existence of a “third” category of personal property into which digital assets could fall, which would give investors increased legal protection.
Digital Gilt Instrument — The Chancellor has announced
opens in a new tab
plans to issue a Digital Gilt Instrument (DGIT) within the Digital Securities Sandbox which opened in September. The PRA has also published a request for information
opens in a new tab
on firms’ current and expected cryptoasset exposures, to inform its calibration of the relevant prudential treatment.
UK AI use — The BoE/FCA’s latest AI survey
opens in a new tab
showed that 75% of firms are already using some form of AI in their operations, up from 53% in 2022. As a result, the Financial Policy Committee is expected to publish an assessment of AI’s impact on financial stability in early 2025. This will likely include possible interactions with the new regime for Critical Third Parties.
UK AI Bill — The Secretary of State for Science, Innovation and Technology recently announced an upcoming AI Bill. Focusing on the regulation of advanced models, the Bill would seek to formalise voluntary agreements made under the Conservative Government. Interestingly, this represents a potential departure from the current ‘hands off’ approach.
AI model training — The government has also issued a new copyright consultation
opens in a new tab
proposing exemptions for text and data mining during AI model training. With an ‘opt out’ model for rightsholders, this appears to favour technology companies over the creative sector. However, a cross — party alliance within the House of Lords is already pushing for amendments.

https://kpmg.com/xx/en/our-insights/esg/how-issa-5000-will-deliver-on-investor-demand-for-high-quality-sustainability-reporting.html,ESG,How ISSA 5000 will deliver on investor demand for high-quality sustainability reporting,,"Sustainability reporting is set to be held to a higher standard
Sustainability reporting is rapidly becoming a must for most companies, with ESG investing going mainstream and investors considering sustainability as part of their decision making. The demand for higher quality sustainability information has led to the introduction of ISSA 5000, a focused standard that seeks to bring the rigor of financial statement auditing to sustainability information. A new report from KPMG, “Are you ready for ISSA 5000,” examines what the new standard will mean and how companies should prepare.
“ISSA 5000 represents the next generation of sustainability assurance,” said Mike Shannon, Global Head of ESG Assurance, KPMG International. “Sustainability has become a determining factor in where investors put their money, what products consumers buy, and where people choose to work. This has raised the expectations for the quality of sustainability information so that it is more credible and comparable. The goal of the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB) with ISSA 5000 is to set a high-quality international standard that strengthens public confidence in the global profession and therefore in the information being reported.”
How will ISSA 5000 change sustainability reporting to meet the demands for greater credibility, quality and comparability? Here are five keyways:
ISSA 5000 is not a generic standard; it is specifically focused for sustainability assurance engagements. It is flexible for all sustainability topics and frameworks and scales requirements for reasonable and limited assurance engagements, with reasonable assurance being equivalent to a financial statement audit.
Determining materiality under the standard is more rigorous and targeted. Risk is defined at both the disclosure level for limited assurance and assertion level for reasonable assurance, considering both financial and impact materialities when required by the sustainability framework such as the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS).
Internal controls will be more closely scrutinized.  Assurance providers will challenge processes, and the completeness of material matters, and information identified to report.
The standard recognizes that evidence will often need to be obtained from third-party value chain entities and includes specific requirements for how assurance providers determine whether and how to use the work of other assurance providers.
Forward-looking information, such as targets and plans, now have more specific direction on the procedures to perform.  Assurance providers may seek more specific understanding of how the information is prepared, including methods, assumptions and data.
In recent years there has been a proliferation of national climate laws and policies as regulators have gotten more engaged in the reporting of sustainability information. What has been lacking, until now, is a specific sustainability assurance standard to address the unique challenges and opportunities in assuring sustainability information.

Preparing for ISSA 5000

Organizations should assess the potential impact of ISSA 5000, taking into account how local standard setters and regulators intend to adopt the standard.
“Producing sustainability reporting isn’t a siloed function,” said Mary Bonnici, Senior Director, Global Audit Methodology Group, KPMG International. “Whether undertaking it for the first time or making changes to meet ISSA 5000, the impact can extend across the entire organization, including the company’s people, processes, systems, and governance.”
“It is also important for organizations to consult with their assurance provider early in planning for ISSA 5000,” Mary said. “Your assurance provider can review your process and inspect supporting documentation. The objective is to professionally challenge the process used and the appropriateness of material matters, and information identified or excluded. A key focus is on the completeness of the material information.”
For jurisdictions that have adopted IAASB standards, ISSA 5000 will apply for assurance engagements on sustainability information for reporting periods beginning on or after December 15, 2026. Once ISSA 5000 is effective, International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 will no longer apply to assurance engagements on sustainability information.

Welcome to the latest edition of European Regulatory Radar
The new issue of European Regulatory Radar brings you the latest updates impacting financial services providers in the region. Complementing the UK Regulatory Radar series, European Regulatory Radar provides an overview of the wider economic and political environment, progress across the regulatory agenda and deep-dive articles on some of the most important regulatory developments.

The wider economic and political environment

Ursula von der Leyen’s new College of Commissioners has now been finalised, signalling the start of the next five-year legislative cycle. The new programme
opens in a new tab
will focus on reinvigorating the EU economy, boosting competitiveness, reducing bureaucracy and closing the innovation gap with the United States and China.
In its latest Financial Stability Review
opens in a new tab
, the ECB highlights “elevated financial stability vulnerabilities in a volatile environment”. With inflation closer to 2%, concerns have shifted to downside risks. Although markets have been resilient so far and the EBA’s December Risk Dashboard
opens in a new tab
(RDB) showed bank profitability to be holding up well, the ECB cautions against complacency, flagging key areas of vulnerability such as stretched valuations in equity and corporate bond markets, high risk concentration and sovereign debt sustainability challenges in several euro area countries. It also notes the need for a comprehensive set of measures to increase the resilience of the non-bank financial intermediary sector.
Insurers face similar issues, with EIOPA’s Financial Stability Report
opens in a new tab
noting “a challenging risk landscape marked by high uncertainties”. EIOPA is monitoring key and emerging areas of risk, including insurers’ holdings of real estate, asset intensive reinsurance transactions, and digitalisation and cyber. Nevertheless, EIOPA’s 2024 stress test results
opens in a new tab
reveal that European insurers remain well positioned – see more below.

Progressing the regulatory agenda

Policy initiatives have continued to progress.
Banks — 1 January 2025 marked the start of implementation of the bulk of the final Basel reforms through the amended Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR3
opens in a new tab
). Implementation of the market risk components (FRTB) will follow on 1 January 2026, coinciding with the start of the UK’s Basel 3.1 implementation.
The 2025 EBA EU-wide stress test
opens in a new tab
exercise has now commenced, with submissions due in April, June and early July, and results expected in early August. The 2025 test will have a wider geographical reach and greater focus on proportionality than the 2023 iteration.
The ECB has published the results
opens in a new tab
of its 2024 Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP) which guides the calibration of capital requirements, qualitative measures and supervisory priorities. Overall, the ECB found the euro area banking sector to have remained resilient, with banks maintaining capital and liquidity positions well above regulatory requirements and good profitability. The average SREP score was broadly stable. However, internal governance, risk management and operational resilience are still key areas of concern.
The ECB’s updated supervisory priorities
opens in a new tab
for 2025 to 2027 reflect the need for prudence in the face of persistent geopolitical tensions and continuing uncertainty around the macroeconomic outlook . The ECB will focus on banks' resilience to these threats, the importance of timely remediation of known material shortcomings and the need to address challenges stemming from digital transformation and new technologies. The ECB emphasises the importance of strengthening credit risk management frameworks, addressing persistent deficiencies in risk data aggregation and reporting (RDARR), and implementing robust digitalisation strategies to manage the risks associated with new technologies. For more, see below.
Insurers — The revamped Solvency II
opens in a new tab
and new Insurance Recovery and Resolution
opens in a new tab
(IRRD) Directives have been published in the Official Journal, and their provisions will generally apply from 30 January 2027. EIOPA and the European Commission are busy developing the technical details that will sit underneath these Directives.
The second batch
opens in a new tab
of Solvency II technical consultations covers biodiversity risk management, regulatory technical standards (RTS) on managing sustainability risks, diversity of management bodies, revised guidelines on undertaking specific parameters, market and counterparty risk exposures in the standard formula (SF), and implementing technical standards (ITS) on which entities should be treated as 'central governments' when calculating the SF SCR.
EIOPA is consulting on capital requirements for insurers holding cryptoassets, proposing a 100% haircut regardless of balance sheet treatment and investment structure. However, it remains possible that a differentiated treatment could be applied to certain cryptoassets authorised under the Markets in Cryptoassets Regulation
opens in a new tab
(MiCAR).
In addition, as a result of proposed threshold changes to Solvency II, EIOPA is now calling
opens in a new tab
for consistent and effective supervisory practices to align these changes to the EU’s Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA).
Finally, the 2024 EIOPA stress test
opens in a new tab
results have shown the insurance industry to be well-capitalised and able to withstand the associated ‘severe but plausible’ scenario. EIOPA will however continue to monitor for resilience, particularly around liquidity and procyclicality under stressed conditions.
Asset managers — ESMA has launched a data gathering exercise
opens in a new tab
on the costs associated with manufacturing and distributing EU investment funds. The aim is to increase transparency around these costs to help develop a more competitive market for EU UCITS and AIFs.
ESMA has continued to progress the development of the AIFMD II level two materials by consulting
opens in a new tab
on new rules for open-ended loan originating AIFs. The draft rules set out the characteristics that need to be met to permit these funds to maintain an open-ended structure.
ESMA has also published a noteworthy Q&A
opens in a new tab
on its ESG-related fund names guidelines. While it clarifies expectations on exclusions related to controversial weapons and on green bonds, the most interesting comments relate to a 50% minimum investment threshold in sustainable investments for funds that use “sustainable” terms.
Meanwhile, the proposed Retail Investment Strategy
opens in a new tab
is at a crossroads and the shape of any final package remains to be seen.
Capital markets — Following the MiFIR review
opens in a new tab
, RTS are expected to be updated throughout 2025 which firms will need to monitor for the impact on their trade and transactions reporting. ESMA has started the tender process
opens in a new tab
for the bonds consolidated tape.
The European Market Infrastructure Regulation
opens in a new tab
(EMIR) 3.0 requirements for EU counterparties to have active accounts at EU CCPs will apply from end-June. Trade associations are asking
opens in a new tab
the Commission to extend the equivalence decision for UK CCPs (which expires at end of June 2025) in a non-time-limited manner and well in advance of 31 March 2025 to avoid market stress and disruption.
Following publication of the Listing Act package in the Official Journal, Member States are required to transpose the changes to the Listing Directive and MiFID II into national law by 6 June 2026 and for the multiple-vote shares directive by 5 December 2026.
Amendments to the Prospectus Regulation and Market Abuse Regulation have come into effect, subject to exceptions.
Provisional agreement
opens in a new tab
was reached in December 2024 on the review of the EU Benchmark Regulation. In an effort to reduce the regulatory burden, the Council and Parliament have agreed with the Commission’s original proposal that non-significant benchmarks should no longer be within scope of the regulation.
ESMA has recommended
opens in a new tab
a move to T+ 1 in Q4 2027, giving firms just under two years to increase automation in settlement processes in order to meet the compressed settlement time frame.
Operational resilience — DORA
opens in a new tab
took full effect from 17 January and will have a significant impact on many financial entities either based or operating in the EU. Third party risk management, and more specifically critical third parties (CTPs), will increasingly be in the spotlight.
In advance of this deadline, the EBA, EIOPA and ESMA issued a joint statement
opens in a new tab
reminding firms of their obligations and the fact that fines will be imposed for non-compliance.

ESG and sustainable finance — The EBA has finalised its guidelines on the management of ESG risks. The guidelines are prescriptive and cover detailed requirements on materiality assessments, identification and measurement of ESG risks, managing and monitoring ESG risks, and transition plans. They will apply from 11 January 2026, or from 11 January 2027 at the latest for small and non-complex institutions.
Regulation ((EU) 2024/3005) on the transparency and integrity of ESG rating activities has now been published in the Official Journal and will apply from 2 July 2026. The regime recognises that ESG ratings play an important role in global capital markets and consequently addresses the need for them to be independent, comparable where possible, transparent and of adequate quality.
Firms and EU Member States have been vocal about the complexity and volume of sustainability reporting and whether it will achieve the intended outcomes. In a move to reduce the reporting burden, a new “Omnibus” regulation combining CSRD, CSDDD and the Taxonomy Regulation is expected from the European Commission on 26 February.  For more, see below:

As the move to passive investing is maintained, regulators are understandably keeping their focus on the robustness and integrity of financial benchmarks. This article outlines recent regulatory developments for benchmark administrators (BMAs).

UK Developments

The FCA has published its third supervisory strategy letter
opens in a new tab
 to benchmark administrators. Overall, the focus areas have not changed significantly from the previous letter issued in 2022. However, the latest letter indicates increased proactivity in supervision from the FCA with a number of multi-firm reviews planned. The FCA also specifies that the UK Benchmarks regulation (BMR) will be reviewed as part of the process of replacing assimilated EU law with regulators’ rules – however no time frame is given.
The FCA supervisory priorities are:

Corporate governance and oversight

FCA expectations
Management bodies are effectively overseeing strategic decision-making, risk management and regulatory compliance and providing robust challenge to the business. This is in addition to having a permanent and effective oversight function as referred to in Article 5 of the UK BMR.
All BMAs have effective enterprise risk management frameworks.
BMAs are able to share with the FCA their own assessment of the effectiveness of their overall governance along with any plans they have to address any weaknesses.
FCA action
Multi-firm review in late 2025 to assess how UK regulated BMAs are governed by their SMFs and to what extent they can oversee the full range of risks to which the BMA is exposed.

Data quality controls

FCA expectations
Robust and regularly reviewed due-diligence processes are in operation for selecting data providers. Once selected, there are adequate processes and MI to monitor third-party data providers on an ongoing basis, including reviewing any operational changes to ensure relationships stay within risk appetites.
Oversight and controls should be especially robust when using innovative and nascent non-price data inputs to produce benchmarks, such as ESG or AI-generated data. These data sources are typically unregulated and often subjective, relying heavily on modelling and estimates.
Clear policies and procedures for data controls processes are in place, with detailed mapping of roles and responsibilities, strong quality assurance processes and controls.
FCA action
Beginning in early 2025, a multi-firm review that will evaluate the due diligence performed on data providers, seeking evidence of how control frameworks adequately mitigate the additional risks associated with unregulated or innovative data.

Benchmark controls

FCA expectations
Processes and controls to calculate benchmarks take into consideration the design of the benchmark, including its complexity, and perform the rebalancing when due, with appropriate governance and oversight.
Appropriate governance and oversight for the launch of more complex and custom benchmarks is robustly and objectively undertaken, including sign-off at an appropriately senior level.
Prompt identification, investigation, and escalation of errors of calculation or rebalancing, with root cause analysis to address any gaps and prevent reoccurrences is embedded with firms. MI is used to continuously improve the rebalancing processes and the overall effectiveness of the control framework.
FCA action
In H2 2025, building on the planned multi-firm review of data input controls, another multi-firm review to evaluate the adequacy of the end to-end benchmark controls. The FCA will be seeking evidence that BMAs have adapted their controls for the launch, calculation, and rebalancing of custom or complex benchmarks.

Disclosures

FCA expectations
BMAs regularly revisit their disclosures to ensure they remain fit-for-purpose, especially considering the added complexity of some multi-asset benchmarks, to ensure they comply with all rules regarding low carbon benchmarks and sustainability-related disclosures.
To comply with the Anti-Greenwashing Rule
opens in a new tab
, BMAs take steps to ensure they do not make any misleading claims or provide false impressions through the naming of benchmarks. This is particularly important given that many benchmark names are incorporated into fund names, which fall under the SDR naming and marketing rules
opens in a new tab
.

Operational Resilience

FCA expectations
BMAs minimise the risk of major disruptions and continue to improve overall operational resilience by proactively identifying and addressing any weaknesses in current arrangements.

EU developments

EU Benchmarks Regulation Review

The Council and Parliament reached provisional agreement
opens in a new tab
 in December 2024 on the review of the EU Benchmark Regulation. A number of BMAs (including third-country benchmark providers) will welcome this agreement as, in an effort to reduce the regulatory burden, the Council and Parliament have agreed with the Commission’s original proposal, that non-significant benchmarks should no longer be within scope of the regulation.
Non Significant Benchmarks
BMAs (of non-significant benchmarks) will be able to request the voluntary application of the rules (opt-in) under certain conditions. This may be useful for BMAs who don’t want the complexity of administrating two different sets of requirements for significant and non-significant benchmarks, especially as benchmarks could shift from one set of requirements to another depending upon their usage. 
However, the agreement intends for the development of further qualitative criteria in addition to the existing usage criteria for significant benchmarks, for example, when the benchmark has no, or very few, appropriate market-led substitutes. This may lead to an additional level of subjectivity on the non-significant / significant boundary for the industry to work through.
Third Countries
With the aim of rationalising the supervision of third-country benchmarks, ESMA will be granted supervisory powers over entities endorsing third-country benchmarks in addition to the existing powers in relation to recognition. This should simplify the approach for firms and provide greater consistency across the EU market.
BMAs will have a year to prepare as the revised regulation will apply from 1 January 2026.

ESMA consultation on guidelines on internal controls

Also in December 2024, ESMA published a consultation
opens in a new tab
on guidelines for internal controls for Benchmark Admins (and Credit Rating Agencies (CRAs) & Data Reporting Service Providers). This consultation builds upon and replaces the Guidelines on Internal Control for CRAs (from Sept 2020) and set out ESMA’s views for all entities it directly supervises (except third-country central counterparties).  It shows ESMA’s updated expectations related to the growing use of technology, for example, expectations around governance and risk management frameworks around the use of artificial intelligence. It also demonstrates ESMA expectations around the management of third-party providers. The guidelines set out ESMAs expectations around the framework for internal controls and its expectations for internal control functions – compliance, risk management, information security, internal audit and oversight function for BMAs. The consultation closes on 18 March 2025.

Implications for Benchmark Administrators

BMAs are advised to keep track of the regulatory environment over the next year as changes get finalised and supervisory reviews are undertaken.
The original BMR regulation set out to ensure good conduct in the development and calculation of benchmarks used within the European Union. The latest current supervisory guidance re-enforces the need for strong business governance along with a robust framework for managing operational risks and operational resilience.
This includes clear management of risks as a result of dependence on third parties (including input data), managing all input data risks (not just pricing feeds) and the risks related to running more complex custom and bespoke indices for clients.
Third-country administrators providing benchmarks into the European Union are already assessing the best third-country mechanism for continuing to sell their products after December 2025. For those providing non-significant benchmarks the modified EU BMR requirements may ease some of the burden. However, each firm will need to assess the positive and negatives depending on the products they sell, their reputation and brand and their own customers’ future requirements.

How KPMG in the UK can help

KPMG can support in assessing BMA’s readiness against the supervisory review areas during 2025, including benchmarking against peer practices. It is anticipated that firms will need to be able to demonstrate their governance, policies and controls in these areas once the FCA seeks further engagement and clarification.
For third-country BMAs, KPMG can assist in selecting the most suitable entry mechanism into the EU and UK BMR regimes, including assisting the business to be suitably prepared for the BMR obligations and supervisory expectations.

https://kpmg.com/xx/en/our-insights/operations/q4-24-venture-pulse-report-united-states.html,Operations,Q4’24 Venture Pulse Report – United States,,"During Q4’24, the US saw total VC investment rise to its highest level since Q2’22 as interest and investment in AI continued to be red-hot. The sector accounted for more than half of the country’s top ten deals, including the first $10 billion venture round ever seen in the US.

Deal volume remains subdued in US despite major increase in deal value

Despite the significant uptick in deal value in the US, the total number of VC deals remained subdued during Q4’24. VC investors continued to focus on quality over quantity given the ongoing uncertainties in the market, including global conflicts and geopolitical tensions, the US presidential election which occurred mid-way through the quarter, and the ongoing lack of exits.

Largest crop of multi-billion VC funding rounds ever in the US

Q4’24 was a banner year for multi-billion dollar VC deals in the US. Five companies raised VC rounds at or above $4 billion, including Databricks ($10 billion), OpenAI ($6.6 billion), xAI ($6 billion), Waymo ($5.6 billion), and Anthropic ($4 billion). All five companies are major players in the AI space, with OpenAI, xAI and Anthropic focused primarily on generative AI and Waymo focused on using AI to enable autonomous driving capabilities.

Late stage deals on the rise, suggesting increasing confidence heading into 2025

In 2022 and 2023, a good number of late stage investments in the US were lifeline investments aimed at helping companies survive a period of significant uncertainty and the pushing out of the IPO market opening. In Q4’24, after a period of significant cost-cutting and looking for efficiencies, a number of later stage startups have turned their attention back to growth — raising fresh funding rounds to drive their short-term growth, improve their balance sheets, and position themselves for an IPO in 2025 or 2026.

Successful post IPO performance of tech companies helping to fuel optimism for 2025

The combination of interest rate cuts, the easing of some uncertainty in the wake of the presidential election, the fact a number of tech companies have performed very well post-IPO in recent months — including Reddit, whose stock price rose 240%, and Rubrik and Astera Labs, whose stock prices have both climbed more than 100% — and even the excitement of VC investors for almost all things AI, has helped spark optimism for the IPO and M&A markets in the trailing months of 2024.1 A significant number of companies are ready to go once the IPO door swings fully open; the big question is more a matter of exactly when in 2025 that will happen.

CVC investment in US very resilient over 2024

Over the course of 2024, CVC investment in the US remained quite solid, particularly compared to CVC investment in other regions of the world. Interest in AI likely had a role to play in this resilience, with many large US corporates choosing to make sizable investments in innovative and agile AI model and infrastructure companies rather than seeking to drive AI innovation in-house.

Trends to watch for in Q1’25

Heading into Q1’25, VC market participants will be watching the exit market in the US, with growing expectations that IPO activity will pick up significantly. While a major rise in IPO exits right out the gate may not be in the cards given the uncertainty associated with the forthcoming administration changeover, Q1’25 could see IPO filings and related activity heating up as companies position themselves for exits in Q2’25 and Q3’25. M&A activity is also expected to pick up in Q1’25, particularly if the US Federal Reserve continues to make cuts to interest rates.
While AI is expected to remain the hottest ticket for VC investors in the US during Q1’25, a number of other sectors are also expected to see solid investment, including defense tech, cybersecurity and life sciences. Crypto could also see a resurgence in interest from VC investors given the change in administration

""Everything will likely change very quickly in 2025. There is potentially going to be changes to rules, regulations, legislation. We’re likely going to see businesses changing how they think about internal cost structures, how they deliver services, how they’re protecting their organizations from cybersecurity risks. We’re going to see a lot of investment in AI, in defense techs, in robotics. The attitude in the VC market heading into 2025 needs to be how can we adapt as quickly as possible to all the changes that are coming? ""

During the quarter, the AI space accounted for the five largest deals of the quarter, led by a $10 billion raise by Databricks.

Americas attracts lion’s share of VC investment, as investment in Asia slumps

At a regional level, the Americas accounted for a significant amount of VC investment in Q4’24, driven in large part by a several large deals in the US. While Europe saw VC investment rise quarter-over-quarter, the total level of investment in the region remained relatively soft compared to other recent quarters. The UK accounted for the largest share of VC funding in the region, driven by a $1.3 billion raise by AI-enabler data platform company GreenScale.
Asia continued to see very soft levels of funding during Q4’24. A $1.1 billion raise by China-based clean energy developer CNNP Rich Energy accounted for the largest deal in Asia during the quarter.

AI rakes in over $32 billion in $1 billion+ VC deals

The AI space globally attracted a major proportion of all global VC funding this quarter; Over $32 billion of this funding came from $1 billion+ deals, including Databrick’s $10 billion raise, a $6.6 billion raise by OpenAI, a $6 billion raise by xAI, a $5.6 billion raise by Waymo, a $4 billion raise by Anthropic, and a $1.3 billion raise by GreenScale. The US attracted the vast majority of AI investment this quarter, although all regions saw robust interest in AI-focused companies.
AI model and infrastructure companies attracted many of the quarter’s largest deals, as interest and competition in the space remained very hot. Startups focused on the application of AI to address specific challenges and industries also saw substantial interest from VC investors across regions during Q4’24. In addition to autonomous driving company Waymo’s large raise, a number of companies raised significant rounds, including Turkey-based marketing platform Insider ($500 million), UK-based travel and hospitality platform Lighthouse ($370 million),and China-based Didi Autonomous driving ($298 million).

Defense Tech sees record year of VC investment

During 2024, defense tech was very high on the radar of VC investors globally, attracting a record level of funding. With no end in sight for the conflicts in the Ukraine and the Middle East, and geopolitical tensions between other countries simmering, governments around the world have increasingly embraced working with defense tech companies, particularly those with AI-enabled defense tech solutions.
While historically there has been some stigma associated with defense tech companies, making it difficult for startups in the space to raise funds — particularly in Silicon Valley — times have changed in recent quarters. A number of defense tech companies have been quite successful in breaking preconceived notions about defense tech and raised major rounds. Niche funds have also emerged focused specifically on making defense tech investments.

Trends to watch for in Q1’25

Heading into 2025, there is growing optimism that global VC investment will continue to pick up, particularly if interest rates continue to fall and the exit environment perks up. In Q1’25, all eyes will be on the IPO market; with the US election complete, market conditions improving, and the successful post-IPO performance of companies like Reddit, Rubrik and Astera Labs, there is growing optimism that the exit market will see a resurgence in 2025. While it could take some time, should IPO exits materialize, activity across the VC market will likely pick up considerably. VC investment in AI will likely continue to outpace investment in all other sectors heading in to Q1’25, with investment continuing to broaden into a wider range of sub-sectors — such as industry solutions and AI-enabled robotics. Corporates will likely continue to drive a large share of AI funding as the large tech giants compete for prominence, and as industry players look to leverage AI to improve their operational efficiencies and provide more value to their customers. Areas like defense tech, health and biotech, cybersecurity, and alternative energy will likely also continue to attract interest from VC investors.

""The level of investment into AI continues to be massive. That’s not surprising. But I think people are now starting to become more discerning as to who the winners may be in the AI space — the companies with credible business models, creating highly disruptive solutions, as opposed to others who have put AI wrappers on existing solutions. The largest deals of this quarter underscore that — they’re the companies that people have been putting their bets on through all the AI-hype.""

Highlights

– The requirements in brief
– Updating IFRS 19
– Effective date and transition
– Frequently asked questions (FAQs)

Subsidiaries of companies using IFRS® Accounting Standards can substantially reduce their disclosures and focus more on users’ needs following the release of IFRS 19 Subsidiaries without Public Accountability: Disclosures, from the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). 
A subsidiary that does not have public accountability, and has a parent that produces consolidated accounts1 under IFRS Accounting Standards, is permitted to apply IFRS 19. 
Subsidiaries that currently apply the IFRS for SMEs® Accounting Standard or local GAAP in their statutory financial statements will no longer need to prepare two sets of accounts for group reporting purposes if IFRS 19 is applied.

The requirements in brief

IFRS 19 allows eligible subsidiaries to apply IFRS Accounting Standards with the reduced disclosure requirements of IFRS 19. 
A subsidiary may choose to apply the new standard in its consolidated, separate or individual financial statements provided that, at the reporting date: 
it does not have public accountability2; and
its parent produces consolidated financial statements3 under IFRS Accounting Standards. 
A subsidiary applying IFRS 19 is required to clearly state in its explicit and unreserved statement of compliance with IFRS Accounting Standards that IFRS 19 has been adopted (see FAQs below).

Updating IFRS 19

The IASB intends to update IFRS 19 on an ongoing basis as new or amended disclosure requirements in IFRS Accounting Standards are issued.
Because of the timing of IFRS 19’s publication, disclosure requirements in new or amended IFRS Accounting Standards issued between 28 February 2021 and May 2024 were included in IFRS 19 without reductions. The IASB issued a ‘catch-up’ exposure draft in July 2024 to consult on reducing the disclosure requirements for the relevant standards issued in this period, most notably IFRS 18 Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements: read our comment letter (PDF 196 KB).

Effective date and transition

Eligible subsidiaries can choose to apply the standard for reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2027. Earlier application is permitted.
Consider whether your subsidiaries are eligible to apply this new IFRS Accounting Standard. Speak to your local KPMG contact for further guidance.

The OECD is working on the global implementation of tax proposals under two “pillars” as part of its BEPS project. Pillar Two focuses on ensuring that large MNEs pay a minimum rate of tax. Keeping up with Pillar Two legislation will be one of the biggest challenges MNE tax teams will face in the next few years. Most of the OECD’s member jurisdictions are moving steadily towards enacting Pillar Two rules, with close to 40 countries implementing the rules in 2024 and up to 60 countries expected to implement rules by the end of next year. As a result, 95 percent of in-scope MNEs will be affected in 2025 by Pillar Two Rules. This first article is designed for those clients just beginning their journey or those that have taken steps forward but need to validate work completed to date.

Is your company ready for Pillar Two's Global Minimum Tax?

This article is designed for those clients just beginning their journey or those that have taken steps forward but need to validate work completed to date.

Key takeaways for tax leaders managing through Pillar Two

MNEs need to act quickly to prepare for the OECD’s Pillar Two Global Minimum Tax, which will be enacted in countries around the world as early as 2024.

MNEs with consolidated revenue above EUR 750 million are affected. Pillar Two imposes a 15 percent minimum tax rate in each jurisdiction in which an MNE operates.

To comply with these rules, tax teams will require substantial new forms of financial data they may not currently have access to within their organizations.

To prepare for Pillar Two, companies should begin with an impact assessment. This assessment will:
Identify the MNE group’s Ultimate Parent Entity (UPE) and the accounting standards applied to consolidate the constituent entities of the MNE
Perform a legal entity classification for each constituent entity of the MNE
Assess eligibility for safe harbor rules that apply for the first three years that Pillar Two rules apply
Model preliminary cash tax impacts
Consider the impact of any planned M&A activity
Prepare for new financial statement disclosures.
An impact assessment can lead to early identification of adverse outcomes from Pillar Two and enhance business planning.

Pillar Two focuses on ensuring that large Multinational Enterprises (MNEs) pay a minimum rate of tax. Under these global anti-base erosion (GloBE) rules, MNEs with consolidated revenue above EUR750 million will be subject to a minimum 15 percent tax rate in each jurisdiction in which they operate. MNEs will need to look at their operations in each of these jurisdictions separately to see whether their effective tax rate falls under 15 percent. If so, a top-up tax (TUT) will need to be calculated and paid. MNE groups will be required to file a GloBE Information Return and generally make any required payments within 15 months after the last day of their fiscal year. MNE groups that do not comply with these rules may be subject to significant penalties.

Challenges and opportunities

In response to the global implementation of Pillar Two, multinational corporations are reconsidering their global effective tax rate building blocks and business structures.
With the introduction of a global minimum tax rate of 15 percent, companies are compelled to navigate a drastically altered fiscal landscape, where traditional strategies that rely on low-tax jurisdictions may no longer yield the same benefits. This shift has spurred a wave of strategic restructuring, with firms seeking innovative approaches to align with the new regulations while safeguarding their financial interests.
The ongoing evolution of the OECD's administrative guidance on Pillar Two adds another layer of complexity to this already challenging scenario. Companies must remain agile, adapting their strategies in real-time to comply with the emerging details of the rules.

Unlocking global opportunities: Strategic tax responses and business restructurings in the era of Pillar Two

This article explores how MNEs can seize global opportunities by implementing strategic tax responses and business restructurings that are fit for the evolving landscape shaped by Pillar Two.

Key takeaways for tax leaders managing through Pillar Two

Multinational corporations must be ready to navigate a drastically altered fiscal landscape where traditional strategies that rely on low-tax jurisdictions may no longer yield the same benefits.

Significant opportunities exist for tailored business restructuring that can optimize tax positions under the new global tax regime.

Comprehensive Pillar Two impact assessments allow companies to evaluate planning opportunities more effectively.

Many companies’ business restructuring focuses on legal entity rationalization, retrofitting structures and tax attribute optimization.

Other strategic responses include using transitional safe harbors, developing longer-term strategies and reviewing new incentives.

Leveraging technology and modeling solutions like the KPMG BEPS 2.0 Automation Technology (KBAT) are critical for groups wanting to get ahead of the curve and adopt best-in-class responses to Pillar Two.

Highlights

– Setting IFRS® Sustainability Disclosure Standards
– Driving connectivity between financial and sustainability reporting
– Other proposed updates
– Have your say – Comments due by 28 March 2025

The Due Process Handbook (the Handbook) of the IFRS Foundation currently outlines the processes to follow when setting IFRS® Accounting Standards.  
The Trustees of the IFRS Foundation have proposed updates to the Handbook to:  
specify formally the due process for setting IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards; 
introduce a process to drive connectivity between financial and sustainability reporting; and 
provide clarifications and enhancements in other areas.

Setting IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards

Since its inception, the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) has been developing new standards according to the process specified in the Handbook for the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).
The Trustees propose to update the Handbook to:
formally specify the ISSB’s due process; 
include specific due process for SASB1 Standards and the related taxonomy; and
clarify that the IASB and the ISSB (the Boards) follow the same due process, except for some specific differences.

Driving connectivity between financial and sustainability reporting

The IASB and ISSB aim for their respective requirements to work well together to provide a comprehensive package of information for users. To better meet this objective, the proposals introduce a process to:
facilitate knowledge-sharing and coordination between the Boards;
consider opportunities for connections between the Boards’ respective work plans; and
develop standards that are compatible and consistent with each other.

Other proposed updates

Other proposed updates include the following.
Area What’s proposed? What’s the impact?
Post-implementation reviews (PIRs) Clarify the objective and process Focus on whether standards are working as intended when developed 
Minor improvements to IFRS Standards  Expand the scope Allow the inclusion of minor or narrow-scope amendments to IFRS Standards or accompanying material (e.g. guidance or illustrative examples)
IFRS Interpretations Committee – Criteria for a new standard-setting project  Clarify the ‘widespread effect’ criterion A widespread effect would be when the circumstance or transaction is prevalent and there is diversity in the application of IFRS Accounting Standards
Re-exposure criteria Delete the requirement to give more weight to changes in recognition and measurement Changes to disclosures would have equal weight when considering whether re-exposure is necessary

What’s next?

Have your say on the proposals to amend the due process for setting high-quality IFRS Standards. The proposals are open for comment until 28 March 2025.

https://kpmg.com/xx/en/our-insights/regulatory-insights/2025-financial-services-regulatory-priorities.html,Regulatory Insights,2025 Financial Services regulatory priorities,,"January 2025
The October 2024 edition of the KPMG Regulatory Barometer found that regulatory pressure in the financial sector in the UK and EU is as intense as ever. Looking ahead, competitiveness and growth are set to be key areas of focus. Firms may be hoping that this translates into a reduction in the regulatory burden on financial services. So, what can they expect in 2025?
2025 will see the new UK Government and European co-legislators determined to make their own imprints on the FS regulatory landscape.
As signalled in the Chancellor’s Mansion House speech, in spring 2025 the UK government will publish the first Financial Services Growth and Competitiveness Strategy, focusing on five priority growth opportunities - fintech, sustainable finance, asset management and wholesale services, insurance and reinsurance and capital markets (including retail investment). 
The EU is also looking to revive its competitiveness, with the new FS Commissioner seeking to unlock the financing needed for green, digital and social transitions.
This does not, however, mean that regulators will take their primary objectives of financial stability and protecting consumers any less seriously. In-flight policy initiatives will continue on priorities including financial and operational resilience, consumer protection, ESG and digital finance, with heightened levels of supervisory intensity in some areas. Regulators will also be monitoring emerging risks including those arising from geopolitical tensions and technological innovation.
Firms will benefit from using the new year as an opportunity to review their regulatory change portfolios and identify areas that require greater focus – be it to remediate gaps or to seize opportunities.
Financial resilience - banking

1 January 2025 marked the start of implementation of the final Basel reforms in the EU, through the amended Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR3). The market risk (FRTB) component will follow on 1 January 2026. Whilst the UK was also expected to begin its Basel 3.1 implementation on 1 January 2026, the PRA has now announced a further one-year delay to 1 January 2027. This is in response to continuing US uncertainty, with a new Administration, Basel III Endgame rules not yet proposed and potential for them to be substantially watered down compared to other jurisdictions or even scrapped completely. Whatever the outcome, concerns around the “level playing field” continue to frustrate banks. 
Whilst both UK and EU banks currently appear well-capitalised, post-2023 concerns around financial stability will continue to drive key supervisory areas of focus, including credit risk, liquidity monitoring and stress testing. New approaches to the latter will seek to ensure that exercises remain fit for purpose whilst being proportionate and incorporating emerging risks. Both the PRA and ECB have warned that banks must do more on BCBS239 (risk data aggregation) compliance, regulatory reporting and data quality. Boards and executives are expected to ensure robust governance and accountability in all risk areas.
The ability to exit the market in an orderly manner will remain a priority. The PRA’s trading wind down deadline is in March and non-systemic banks and building societies will need to meet the solvent exit requirements by October.
On the back of mandates to support competitiveness, the UK banking sector will be hoping for concessions to reduce the regulatory burden. In 2025, the PRA has said it will outline plans to cut reporting requirements for banks. The Government has asked the PRA and FCA to assess the current mutuals landscape by the end of the year, to inform consideration of how best to support the sector to drive inclusive growth across the UK, including through effective and proportionate regulation. Work is also underway to streamline authorisations and SMF approvals. However, as prudential regulators’ hold firm on the need for vigilance to maintain financial stability, it remains to be seen whether there will be movement in other areas.
See also ESG and Operational Resilience below.
Financial resilience - Insurance

With UK Solvency II now in place, the PRA’s focus is shifting to other policy priorities. These include new rules requiring – almost all – insurers to plan for how they would execute a solvent exit from the market (see KPMG in the UKs practical tips
opens in a new tab
for solvent exit planning) and extensive new requirements for liquidity reporting for some firms (see here for our analysis). The new liquidity reporting expectations aim to improve the PRA’s access to timely and consistent information on insurers’ liquidity positions – an issue that came to the fore during the gilt market stresses in 2022 – but represent a step change in requirements for the impacted firms.
The PRA’s ongoing scrutiny of life insurers’ Funded Reinsurance arrangements is increasingly viewed in the broader context of the changing structure in the life insurance industry (see our analysis here).  The Bank of England’s latest  Financial Stability Report
opens in a new tab
raises alarm bells on the systemic vulnerabilities stemming from the interconnectedness between PE funds and (re)insurers. Given the concerns about the combination of credit exposure, higher risk appetite and leverage, it would not be surprising if the PRA starts taking a closer look at potential policy or supervisory options in 2025, with the life insurance stress test being the first such opportunity.
Meanwhile in Europe, EIOPA and the European Commission are busy developing the technical details that will sit underneath the revamped Solvency II Directive and the new Insurance Resolution and Recovery Directive (IRDD). Despite the backdrop of calls to improve growth and competitiveness, EIOPA is anxious to remind
opens in a new tab
that risk and evidence-based capital requirements are necessary to maintain stability, particularly during uncertain times.
Wealth and asset management

2025 will be a year of refinement for asset managers around their approach to sustainable finance. The phased roll out of the FCA’s Sustainability Disclosure Requirements (SDR) will continue while EU firms will be grappling with the implications of ESMA’s Q&A on its fund names rule. UK wealth managers will need to prepare to be brought into the SDR regime for the first time.
UK wealth and asset managers will need to meet the FCA’s evolving expectations on the Consumer Duty (see below). They will also be getting to grips with proposals on advice and guidance (see Pensions) and will need to prepare for implementation of the new retail disclosure regime once the FCA’s final rules are published later this year. For EU firms, the proposed Retail Investment Strategy is at a crossroads and the shape of any final package remains to be seen.
International regulatory efforts to reduce potential systemic risks are now transitioning from fund liquidity management to leverage. Further clarity will emerge on the European T+1 transition over the year (see Capital Markets). And private asset managers can expect further scrutiny, particularly on valuation, while implementation work on AIFMD II will move into execution mode ahead of the 2026 deadline.
Capital markets

In primary markets, the simplification of the UK listing regime, including a move to a single listing category, went live in July 2024. The FCA aims to finalise rules by H2 2025 for the new Public Offers and Admissions to Trading Regime (POATR) that will replace the UK Prospectus Regime. In the EU, following publication of the Listing Act package in the Official Journal, Member States are required to transpose the changes to the Listing Directive and MiFID II into national law by 6 June 2026 and for the multiple-vote shares directive by 5 December 2026. Amendments to the Prospectus Regulation and Market Abuse Regulation have already come into effect, subject to exceptions. Both jurisdictions are hoping these measures will revive their stock markets.
In the secondary markets, firms will need to manage the complexity of implementing changes to trade and transaction reporting starting to apply both in the EU and the UK emanating from the MiFIR review and the Wholesale Markets Review respectively. EU RTSs will be updated throughout 2025. In the UK, changes
opens in a new tab
to the bonds and derivatives transparency regime will apply from 1 December 2025. Both jurisdictions have started tender processes for bond consolidated tapes.
EMIR 3.0 requirements for EU counterparties to have active accounts at EU CCPs will apply from end June 2025. Trade associations are asking
opens in a new tab
the Commission to extend the equivalence decision for UK CCPs (which expires at end of June 2025) in a non-time-limited manner and well in advance of 31 March 2025 to avoid market stress and disruption.
Firms can expect the final recommendations of the UK Accelerated Settlement Taskforce to be published in early 2025. It is likely to match ESMA’s recommendation
opens in a new tab
to move to T+ 1 in Q4 2027, giving firms across the European capital markets just under two years to increase automation in settlement processes in order to meet the compressed settlement time frame.
Consumer Duty

2024 saw an unprecedented level of supervisory intensity across all sectors to assess whether firms had appropriately aligned their implementation of the Duty to FCA expectations. Sadly, in many areas such as outcomes testing
opens in a new tab
, price and fair value
opens in a new tab
, complaints
opens in a new tab
and the board report
opens in a new tab
itself, the FCA is still making fundamental findings - see related article here. This situation will likely drive further supervisory intensity and increased investigation and enforcement activity.
At the tail end of 2024, the FCA appeared to start to lose patience with some firms in the insurance sector and invoke more of its investigative powers (e.g. s166s and formal attestation requirements). KPMG in the UK expect this trend to continue into other sectors, in some cases translating into referrals into FCA enforcement activity in 2025.
In Q1, the FCA will publish its findings from a wide-ranging review on how firms have implemented consideration of vulnerable customers. Given the materiality of the likely findings, recalibration may require significant time and resource for some firms in 2025. The FCA will also publish its findings relating to customer support (Q1 2025) and implementation of the Duty for closed products (H1 2025).
Operational resilience

There are several key operational resilience milestones in 2025 as regulators and supervisors continue to focus on ensuring that the financial sector can respond appropriately to threats and disruptions.
The EU Digital Operational resilience Act (DORA) takes full effect on 17 January and will have a significant impact on many financial entities either based or operating in the EU. Third party risk management, and more specifically critical third parties (CTPs), will increasingly be in the spotlight. In the EU, CTPs will be captured under DORA. The UK final rules for CTPs – for more see here – came into effect on 1 January and will apply as soon as a third party is designated as critical by HMT.
By 9 February, UK FMIs must also comply with the relevant BoE statements or codes of practice on outsourcing and third-party risk management. And firms in scope of the PRA and FCA operational resilience requirements should now have completed or be nearing the end of their implementation and testing programmes. The final hurdle is to demonstrate, by March 2025, that they can remain within stated impact tolerances when under “severe but plausible” stress scenarios.
Payments

There will be no let-up in the volume of regulatory developments affecting the payments ecosystem in 2025.
Although the PSR’s Authorised Push Payment (APP) fraud and scam reimbursement rules are now in force, regulators will be focused on their effective implementation and the impacts on consumer outcomes. The UK National Payments Vision (NPV) was published in Q4 2024, providing much needed clarity and strategic direction - for more see here
opens in a new tab
. The NPV establishes a clearer regulatory strategy for Open Banking  and many will hope that 2025 is the year the full benefits of Open Banking will start to be realised. The NPV will also enable the move towards a more agile and flexible approach to delivering the UK’s payments infrastructure. The newly established Payments Vision Delivery Committee is working with regulators to clarify the upgrades required to the existing Faster Payments System, assess longer-term requirements and set out an approach by no later than Q2 2025.
In the EU, early 2025 should see the finalisation of Payment Services Directive 3 (PSD3) and the Payment Services Regulation (PSR). Payment service providers will need to identify the changes needed to implement the new rules and plan for compliance by a likely 2026 implementation date. Developments in Open Finance are also expected to pick up pace, with the European Council’s agreement on the Financial Data and Access Regulation (FIDA) in late December 2024 paving the way for final negotiations to begin on the regulation in early 2025.
ESG and Sustainable Finance

Sustainability reporting and disclosures will continue to be a key priority in 2025. First reporting under the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) started from 1 January 2025. Disclosure of transition plans will be required under the CSRD, the ISSB standards and from 2026/27 the EU Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD).
Firms have been vocal about the complexity and volume of reporting and whether it will achieve the intended outcomes. In a move to reduce the reporting burden, a new “omnibus” regulation combining CSRD, CSDDD and the EU Taxonomy Regulation is expected from the European Commission by mid-year.
Meanwhile, the UK is gearing up to endorse the two existing ISSB standards. A government consultation on the proposed UK Sustainability Reporting Standards (UK SRS) is due in March, with few UK deviations anticipated. And the BCBS is consulting on proposals for integrating climate-related risk into Pillar 3 disclosures to complement the ISSB framework and provide a common baseline for internationally active banks.
Prudential supervisors will expect continuing improvement in the measurement and management of climate-related risk. The PRA is due to consult in Q1 on revisions to SS3/19 which will likely mirror some of the enhancements already introduced by the ECB and require further uplift from firms. The Chancellor’s November remit letter
opens in a new tab
also asked the UK Prudential Regulation Committee to consider nature-related risks. The ECB is likely to continue to take a hard line where banks are not deemed to have made sufficient progress against its expectations.
In 2025, EIOPA’s recommendations for capital charges for insurance firms holding equities and bonds in fossil fuel sectors will be considered by the European Commission – see article here. Final policy is also expected on its approach to biodiversity risk management. The IAIS will issue final materials, following four climate risk consultations, on changes to the Insurance Core Principles (ICPs), supporting materials on scenario analysis and market conduct, materials on enterprise risk management and public disclosures.
Digital finance

Major progress was made in 2024 on the regulation of cryptoassets, with more to come in 2025. The EU Markets in Cryptoassets Regulation (MiCAR) applied fully from 30 December. Financial regulators published a raft of supporting technical standards ahead of this and will continue to provide ongoing guidance during the initial transitional period as Member States move from applicable national law onto the MiCAR regime – to note, the transitional period will vary by state, up to and including 1 July 2026.
The new UK Government has committed to following through on proposals made by the previous Government, with some adjustments. In short, a number of new cryptoasset regulated activities will be created based on equivalents in traditional finance. However, this work will now be combined into a single phase, rather than addressing stablecoins separately.
The latest FCA roadmap
opens in a new tab
indicates that 2025 will be a year of consultations, with final policy statements to follow in 2026. The government has also announced plans to issue a digital gilt (DIGIT) within the recently-launched Digital Securities Sandbox.
The EU remains a first mover on AI, with the AI Act to be fully operational by late summer 2026. Supplementary guidance will continue to be issued by the financial regulators to complement the cross-sectoral framework.
The UK has so far pursued a more principles-based approach, with a focus on industry-led best practice. In 2024, existing regulators were delegated responsibility to enforce five AI principles. However, a new AI Bill could formalise rules for the developers of certain high-risk systems. In early 2025, the Financial Policy Committee is set to publish its assessment of AI’s impact on financial stability.
Pensions

Significant reforms of the UK’s pension landscape to address fragmentation, facilitate scale, improve governance and unlock increased private investment were expected in 2025. However, the Government’s decision to delay the second stage of the Pensions Review until further notice has created uncertainty about the speed and extent of reforms and the delivery of the Pension Schemes Bill. 
Regardless of the progress of major structural reforms, regulatory focus on value for money and the delivery of the Pensions Dashboards Programme will continue. The FCA, DWP and TPR’s joint framework for workplace defined contribution schemes should be finalised this year following consultation last August. TPR will continue to monitor compliance with its assessment of value rules for defined contribution schemes. Based on the DWP’s staged Pensions Dashboard connection timetable, the connection phase for larger schemes starts on 30 April 2025.The FCA’s end-2024  proposals for a new targeted support regime, stemming from the Advice Guidance Boundary review, will give individuals making pension decisions greater flexibility and allow firms to better indicate and ‘nudge’ suggested actions for them to consider. The regime will likely pose opportunities and challenges for pensions firms in 2025 as it evolves. For more on targeted support see here.

This investment was driven primarily by a substantial increase in VC investment in the US, led by a $10 billion raise by AI firm Databricks.

VC in Canada remains strong

After reaching a ten-quarter high in Q3’24, VC investment in Canada rose further in Q4’24, surpassing $2.5 billion for the first time since Q1, 2022. This increase was despite uncertainties related to the US presidential election in November and related concerns about potential changes that could be made by the incoming administration, including the possible introduction of tariffs.

VC investment in Brazil rises quarter-over-quarter

During Q4’24, VC investors in Brazil continued to focus their investments on startups with strong resilience given the challenging market conditions, and on those with proven market fit or that have managed to achieve profitability. While IPO exits have been dry throughout 2024, Brazil started to see M&A activity creep upwards during Q4’24, including companies beginning to position their organizations for potential sale in 2025.

Canada continues to make bets on AI and health and life sciences

The Canadian government continued to be highly supportive of innovation during Q4’24. During the quarter, it launched the Canadian Sovereign AI Compute Strategy, with plans to invest approximately $2 billion to support Canada’s competitiveness in the AI space by supporting the development of data centres and other computing infrastructure.1 AI-focused Cohere received $240 million from this fund to support the development of a new data centre in Canada.2 In Q4’24, the government also launched the Canadian AI Safety Institute to conduct research related to AI safety, develop AI risk assessment tools, and help with identifying risk mitigation activities.3 The Canadian government also continued to prioritize innovation in the health and life sciences sector; during Q4’24, the government announced a $40 million investment in vaccine developer Aramis Technologies.4 The company also raised CAD$40 million in Series A funding during the quarter.5

Fintech remains key sector for VC investment in Brazil, although other areas also attracting interest

Fintech remained one of the strongest areas of VC investment in Brazil, with SMB financing company Asaas raising $149 million during Q4’24. The fintech market in Brazil has matured quite rapidly over the past five years — driving significant improvements in financial inclusion — a fact that is now leading some smaller fintechs to look at consolidation in order to improve their market share and financial viability and larger fintechs to look at expansion into other countries within Latin America. Outside of the fintech space, a number of other sectors also saw increasing attention from VC investors in Brazil during the quarter, including cleantech, biotech, and healthtech; all three are well positioned to remain trendy among VC investors heading into Q1’25.

Trends to watch for in Q1’25

Looking ahead to Q1’25, VC investment in the Americas is expected to remain very solid, propelled by the continued focus of investors on the AI space. The change in administration in the US could keep investors holding back early in the quarter — particularly in jurisdictions like Canada — until there is more certainty as to the direction the new administration will take.
With COP30 scheduled to be held in Brazil during Q4’25, climate change is expected to be a major focus over the next year; this will likely drive increasing interest and VC investment into the cleantech and climatetech spaces in 2025.
There is a lot of optimism for the IPO market in the Americas heading into 2025, with many eyes watching to see which companies move to exit first; while the US is drawing the most attention, the growing stable of strong and profitable Canadian tech startups suggests that Canada could also see a number of quality IPO exits over the next year or two once the market picks up.

""2024 was not a particularly good year for the VC market in Brazil, but VC investment never stopped completely. VC investors just became more picky, focusing on startups with resilient business models, startups achieving break even, and startups that really bootstrapped proving that their businesses had the right product and market fit. Heading into 2025, there’s a sense of cautious optimism on the part of startups and VC investors. The fact COP30 is being held here could be very good for investment, particularly in the ESG and climatetech spaces.""

https://kpmg.com/xx/en/our-insights/operations/q4-24-venture-pulse-report-asia.html,Operations,Q4’24 Venture Pulse Report – Asia,,"VC investment in Asia plummeted during Q4’24 as all key jurisdictions in the region saw investors pressing pause. While China continued to attract the largest share of investment in the region, including the quarter’s largest VC deal — a $1.1 billion raise by alternative energy company CNNP Rich Energy — megadeals were in short supply in the country during the quarter. VC investment also fell in India and Japan, although the level of investment in Japan remained robust compared to historical trends.

VC investors in Asia focusing on AI applications

AI continued to attract a significant amount of interest from VC investors across Asia during Q4’24. During the quarter, China-based Didi Autonomous Driving raised a $298 million funding round. VC investors in Asia have embraced the applicability of AI to industry solutions, showing significant interest in startups able to apply AI to the challenges of different market sectors; for example, the use if AI to drive more efficient biotech research or the development of more efficient cleantech solutions.

Level of VC investment remains soft in China but interest growing among VC investors

VC investment in China remained very slow in Q4’24 as VC investors held back from deploying capital in the market given the challenging economic environment. Despite the soft level of investment, interest among VC investors in China has picked up in recent months as investors have shown increasing interest in opportunities in the AI space, including AI-related activities like robotics and autonomous driving.
Alternative energy, including electric vehicle manufacturing, has continued to be one of the most resilient areas of VC investment in China. There has been fierce competition among automotive startups in the country, both in the EV space and, more recently, on the autonomous vehicles front.

VC investment in India softens in Q4’24; market activity remains strong

VC investment was quite muted in India during Q4’24, despite relatively strong market activity. The slowdown in completed deals was likely more of a speed bump than a long term challenge, with some optimism that deals will materialize heading into Q1’25. Quick commerce remained a hot sector of investment during the quarter, evidenced by a $350 million raise by ten-minute delivery company Zepto.
An encouraging trend in India has been the increasing number of tech startups looking at IPO exit opportunities — either filing their listing paperwork or beginning the process to do so. Over the last eighteen moths, there has been growing acceptance of these companies by India’s capital markets, stock exchanges, the retail public, and institutional investors. With more institutional investors subscribing to IPOs and more active trade happening, more startups are seeing IPOs as a real exit option.

VC investment in Japan remains solid

In Japan, venture capital (VC) deal value experienced a slight decline in Q4, following a robust Q3. Despite this dip, the overall VC deal value in 2024 exceeded the total for 2023. This increase was primarily driven by significant funding rounds, such as AI startup Sakana AI's $217 million Series A in Q3 and HR management platform SmartHR’s $134 million Series E in Q2.
As more mature startups secure funding, the size of VC rounds has grown significantly. The average VC deal value reached a record $6.6 million as of Q3, up from $5.7 million in 2023.
The market more broadly has also continued to evolve, with a growing number of foreign VC firms looking to do business in the country; for example, recently US-based Anderson Horowitz announced plans to open an office in Japan.
VC investors in Japan have show interest in a diversity of sectors. The healthtech — particularly digital healthcare services — semiconductor, and aerospace and defence sectors have also gained a lot of traction among VC investors in Japan. Deeptech has also grown on the radar of VC investors, in part because of government efforts to encourage investment in the space. The government has been very active in supporting startups in Japan; it is currently in the latter half of its Startup Development Five Year Plan.

Hong Kong’s IPO market shows resilience

Stock market performance in both China and Hong Kong has improved somewhat, possibly helped by the announcement of a $1.4 trillion economic stimulus package by China’s central government and by declining interest rates in Hong Kong. IPO activity in mainland China remained relatively quiet in Q4’24; one exception was the dramatic increase in REIT IPOs.
Hong Kong’s IPO market ranked among the top 5 global IPO venues during 2024, despite a relatively slow first half of the year. IPO activity picked up in Q3’24, led by the IPO of China-based appliance giant Midea, which raised $4 billion in the HKSE’s largest IPO in three years. Then, during Q4’24, China-based Horizon Robotics — a chip manufacturer for robots and autonomous vehicles — held a successful IPO on the HKSX, raising $696 million.1 The HKSX also saw the return of biotech companies looking to IPO in Q4’24, although volume remained well below of historical peaks.
Favourable arrangements between Hong Kong and China contributed to a streamlined approval process for mainland China-based companies to list in Hong Kong; this has subsequently led to more applications for HKSX listings, which bodes well for the HKSE heading into Q1’25.

Trends to watch for in Q1’25

VC investment in China and Hong Kong is expected to remain relatively soft in Q1’25, in part due to the timing of Chinese New Year. At a sector level, AI, robotics, cleantech and biotech are expected to remain on the radar of VC investors. In India, VC market activity is expected to pick up through 2025, with more pre-IPO rounds, more IPOs, and more exits in general. Quick commerce and gaming are expected to remain attractive to VC investors, while stock market trading platforms could also see increasing interest.
Many VC investors in Japan have shifted away from the idea of smaller scale IPOs; over the next few quarters, there will likely be a growing emphasis on accelerating startup growth and on scaling businesses to be globally competitive. Given the rising price of crypto assets, there could also be increasing activity in the crypto wallet and Web3 spaces heading into 2025.

The VC market in Japan is really starting to mature, particularly on the funding side. Early on, there wasn’t much in the way of overseas VC funds looking into the space — there was a big funding gap between Japan and the rest of the world. Now, we’re starting to see more foreign VCs looking to open offices here — Anderson Horowitz just being one. Over the next year, we expect to see more activity from foreign investors, which will be good for Japanese startups as they look to raise bigger rounds.

https://kpmg.com/xx/en/our-insights/operations/q4-24-venture-pulse-report-europe.html,Operations,Q4’24 Venture Pulse Report – Europe,,"VC investment in Europe rose in Q4’24, although the total investment in the region for 2024 fell short of 2023 results, highlighting the significant challenges experienced in the VC space over the last twelve months. The number of VC deals remained very low in Q4’24 as investors placed more capital in a much smaller number of proven, high-quality companies.
 The UK attracted the largest share of VC investment in the region during Q4’24 helped by a $1.3 billion raise by AI-enabler data platform company GreenScale. The UK also attracted the most investment during 2024 as a whole, followed by France and then Germany.

AI attracting interest in Europe, but regulations causing some uncertainty

A number of the largest raises in Europe this quarter occurred in the AI space, including GreenScale’s $1.3 billion raise, the $500 million raise by Insider, and a $370 million raise by UK-based Lighthouse.
With a number of laws and guidance under consideration — on top of the introduction of the EU’s AI Act, which was enacted as of August 2024 — players in the AI space in Europe have faced some uncertainty with respect to the rules they might need to abide by in the future; this uncertainty has likely slowed down some of the VC investment into the AI space in Europe, particularly in comparison to jurisdictions like the US.

Caution continuing to drive VC investors in the UK

VC investment in the UK picked up considerably quarter-over-quarter, although much of the increase can be attributed to the $1.3 billion raise by AI-focused GreenScale. The Q4’24 UK government Budget announcements, such as the decision to increase to the UK’s National Insurance Tax for employers, it is likely to further contribute to investor caution.
The fintech sector in the UK started to see some movement in the M&A space in Q4’24, including the pending acquisition of exchange platform Aquis by Six Group. The sector is well positioned to see additional activity heading into Q1’25. An increasing number of fintechs have also started down the path of IPO readiness, although many of these IPOs are not expected to materialize in the near term.

Very challenging quarter for VC investment in Germany

VC investment in Germany dropped to a 18 quarter low in Q4’24, driven by a range of economic challenges and other uncertainties, including the decision to call an early election. This pause will likely extend into Q1’25 as both startups and VC investors wait and see what the results of the election — scheduled for February 2025 — might mean for the innovation ecosystem.
Large deals were mostly absent in Germany in Q4’24; space technology company The Exploration Company attracted the largest deal in the country during the quarter ($160 million). While funding was limited in Q4’24, a number of sectors continued to see interest from VC investors in Germany, including B2B companies focused on enabling operational efficiencies, ESG reporting, and energy efficiencies, and companies focused on the semiconductors space.
With cost of capital high in Germany at the moment, some investors have also shifted their focus away from the VC market and towards safer alternative investments, while others have narrowed their focus to companies with proven track records or exceptional value propositions; this has led some startups to consider much less favourable terms in order to raise funds or to embrace alternative funding models, such as the use of venture debt.

VC activity in Austria picks up again in Q4’24

The first half of 2024 was a particularly challenging time for the VC market in Austria, with a number of startups struggling to survive. After picking up a bit in Q3’24, VC activity saw a more noticeable rebound in Q4’24, with bigger rounds, more Series A rounds, and even some later stage deals — a trend expected to continue heading into Q1’25. VC investors in Austria showed particular interest in AI use cases, in addition to crypto and B2B solutions.

Nordics region sees solid pick up in VC investment in Q4’24

It was a quiet year for VC investment in the Nordics region. The region received only $5.5 billion of capital this year—a third of the amount raised during its 2021 peak. Large rounds were in very short supply with only a few exceptions. During the quarter, healthtech saw solid interest in the region, led by a $200 million raise by smart-ring company Ōura, while defense tech saw a good number of early-stage companies raising funding for both commercial and military applications. The energy and ESG space also remained hot despite Northvolt’s Q4’24 challenges; it is expected to remain a key sector of interest heading into Q1’25.
The Nordics continued to show its strength as a startup ecosystem; during Q4’24, Helsinki hosted the 16th edition of Slush, a very large event bringing record number of investors to meet entrepreneurs.

Ireland sees VC investment pick up in Q4’24

Year-over-year, VC investment in Ireland remained stable despite the challenging funding environment. Q4 ended strongly with several deals raising over $40 million each.VC investors continued to show interest in a wide range of sectors, from mature areas like health and biotech and fintech to emerging areas like AI applications. While interest in AI was quite high, deals in Ireland primarily occurred at the earliest deal stages during Q4’24; for example, Precision Sports Technology — a company focused on providing real-time feedback on exercise techniques — raised $1 million during the quarter.

Trends to watch for in Q1’25

While there continues to be a significant degree of geopolitical uncertainty in Europe, market conditions have been improving. Cuts to interest rates have helped fuel more positive market activity, a fact seen as quite promising for VC deal-making heading into Q1’25. AI will likely be one of the hottest areas of VC investment in Europe, even with concerns about evolving regulations, in addition to defense tech, energy and energy storage, and health and biotech. Cybersecurity will likely also see growing investment, particularly as AI-enabled cyberattacks become more prevalent.
If there are no major geopolitical incidents, 2025 could see more IPOs in Europe, particularly among the large crypto firms and digital asset players.

""When targeting Series A fundraises and beyond, UK startups are having to focus much more on capital efficiency as most UK VC’s are prioritising companies with a clear path to profitability. Businesses that are loss making in the medium to long term are still attracting a level of investment, but funds that want to pursue these opportunities are dramatically shrinking in number, and tend to have specialist mandates such as being a Deeptech or Biotech specific investor.""

This report, presented at the WEF Annual Meeting 2025, explains how governments, enterprises, academia and civil society can collaborate with the aim of ensuring that AI-driven growth is inclusive.

While the promise of AI is becoming a reality in certain locations, many countries and territories that have limited access to energy-intensive AI infrastructure, advanced computing capability, high-quality data and AI skills could risk missing out on the potential economic and societal benefits promised by age of intelligence.
In 2024, the AI Governance Alliance, part of the World Economic Forum’s Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution (C4IR), introduced the AI Competitiveness through Regional Collaboration Initiative to promote a holistic approach to creating more equitable and responsible AI economies and societies.

. The report, developed in association with KPMG International, offers a preliminary outline of the capabilities that governments, enterprises, academia and wider civic society will require to achieve a successful AI revolution.
The Blueprint for Intelligent Economies outlines a framework for strategic decision-making, providing common terminology and objectives that can be used to shape collaborative action. It offers guidance for countries, territories and regions at any level of digital and AI maturity.

The layers of the blueprint are designed to work together in a logical architecture to harness the power of AI and other emerging technologies to create innovative intelligent economies. Beneath each of the three layers are a set of nine strategic objectives to focus the collaboration required by key stakeholders.

This report finds that close collaboration between national and regional governments, global AI leaders, enterprises, small businesses, academia, civil society and end-users is essential for creating initiatives and tech solutions that can address local needs, as well as fostering the growth of domestic AI innovators.
KPMG International and the WEF’s Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution invite you to explore this blueprint and to participate in the next phase of our work focused on regional challenges.

https://kpmg.com/xx/en/our-insights/ai-and-technology/eu-ai-act-and-the-asean-ai-guide.html,AI and Technology,The 5 As in AI: A comparative review of the EU AI act and the ASEAN AI guide,,"On 21 May 2024, the world’s first major law regulating artificial intelligence, the EU Artificial Intelligence Act, was passed. While the law is meant for EU member states, its implication is far-reaching. The EU AI Act applies a risk-based approach to artificial intelligence, meaning that different applications of the technology are treated differently, depending on the perceived threats they may pose to society.
In ASEAN, the region is still developing its AI strategies and governance framework. The Guide to AI Governance and Ethics released in February 2024 sets out guidelines for ASEAN Member States to follow as they develop their AI systems and regulations.
In this article, Hanim Hamzah, KPMG Law’s Asia Pacific Regional Leader for Legal Services, reflects on EU and ASEAN regulations and the outlook for AI governance in ASEAN. 
Introduction
 As part of its digital strategy, the European Union (“EU”) passed a landmark regulatory framework aimed at ensuring the safe and ethical deployment of artificial intelligence. The EU Artificial Intelligence Act (“EU AI Act”) intends to create coherent and responsible rules governing the use of AI. This legislation is poised to reshape the global landscape of technological governance.
In Southeast Asia, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (“ASEAN”) has released its Guide to AI Governance and Ethics (""ASEAN AI Guide”) which takes a non-binding approach to AI development in the region. The AI Guide sets out guidelines for Member States to follow as they develop their AI systems and regulations.
In this article, we will be looking at both the EU AI Act and the ASEAN AI Guide and discuss on how they fare against each other and what the Asia Pacific region can look forward to in AI regulations. 
 The 5As in AI1. Autonomy
 Both the EU AI Act and the ASEAN AI Guide aims to regulate the extent to which AI systems can operate independent of human oversight, especially in critical areas like healthcare, finance, and law enforcement. While the EU AI Act defines systems as machine-based systems that can, with some level of autonomy, process inputs to generate outputs that influence people and environments, the primary focus of the EU AI Act is to strengthen regulatory compliance and drive transparency and accountability in how AI systems are developed and deployed. The EU AI act further establishes boundaries for autonomous decision-making to prevent scenarios where AI systems act beyond the intended scope of their programming. 
In contrast, the ASEAN AI Guide is meant to serve as a practical guide in designing, developing, and deploying traditional AI technologies for the Member States. It establishes common principles and recommends best practices in implementing AI in the region. The ASEAN AI Guide takes a non-binding approach to AI development with the guidelines to be used by governments and organizations in developing and using AI systems.
2. Access
 The EU AI Act primarily applies to organizations directly involved in the creation and deployment of AI systems in the EU.  Its reach also extends to organizations selling, importing, distributing, or planning for their AI products to be used inside the EU. Thus, any organizations that has a business connection with EU, should have a comprehensive understanding of the rules and its implications. US and global companies that use AI anywhere could be subject to the EU AI Act if the output of the system is used inside the EU.  For example, if a US company uses AI tool to gauge its marketing reach in the EU, that means the output is used in the EU and the EU AI Act will apply.
The ASEAN AI Guide that is confined to Member States is a matter of guidance framework rather than an act of law.  It serves to provide guidelines to ensure AI technologies comply with existing laws and regulations within Member States and it encourages Member States to harmonize their AI regulations to facilitate cross-border cooperation and trade.
3. Ambit
 The EU AI Act with its staggered timeline of application sets forth transition periods for various requirements ranging from 6-24 months. It consists of 13 chapters, each addressing the different aspects of AI regulation. For each AI system being developed or used, companies will need to assess several aspects, such as their role (provider, deployer, importer or distributor), their type (general purpose AI or not), whether there is systemic risk (for general purpose AI) and their levels of risk.  To elaborate, the EU AI Act creates a multi-tiered risk system that establishes obligations for providers and users depending on the different level of AI risk.

Unacceptable Risk
  AI systems that are perceived as a clear threat to the safety, livelihood, and rights of individuals pose an unacceptable risk. These systems will be prohibited though some exceptions may be allowed for law enforcement.
They include:
•       Cognitive behavioral manipulation of people or specific vulnerable group (such as voice-activated toys that encourage dangerous behavior in children)
•       Social scoring (classifies people based on behavior, socio-economic status, or personal characteristics).
•       Real-time and remote biometric identification systems, such as facial recognition.
High Risk
    AI systems that negatively affect safety or fundamental rights. These systems are permitted but must comply with multiple requirements and undergo a conformity assessment.
Such systems include those used in critical infrastructure, education, and employment.
Limited Risk
  AI systems that do not pose a “high” or “unacceptable” risk, but which interact with individuals, are subject to limited transparency obligations. Examples of limited risk could be conversation with chatbots.
Minimal Risk
  An AI system that does not fall into any of the above categories is deemed to pose only a minimal or non-existent risk. It is therefore not subjected to regulations under the EU AI Act. Nonetheless, other law or regulations may still apply to these AI interactions.

In relation to the ASEAN AI Guide, rather than distinct chapters classifying different levels of risks, seven guiding principles are laid out in the ASEAN AI Guide to ensure trust in AI and the design, development, and deployment of ethical AI systems having consideration of broader societal impact. Here are the seven principles:
Transparency and Explainability
Transparency refers to providing disclosures on when an AI system is being used and its involvement in decision making, while explainability is the ability to communicate the reasoning behind an AI system’s decision in way that is understandable to all relevant stakeholders. These principles are expected to build trust in ensuring that users are made aware of AI technology, how their information from the interaction is used and what decisions are made using such information.
Fairness and Equity
To ensure fairness, Member Stats are  encouraged to have measures in place to ensure that decisions made by the algorithm do no further exacerbate or amplify existing discriminatory or unjust impacts across the different demographics. Further, datasets that have been used to train the AI systems should be diverse with appropriate measures taken to mitigate potential biases during data collection and processing.
Security and Safety
Impact or risk assessment should be conducted by Member States to identify and mitigate any risks that may arise from an AI system. This to ensure the safety of developers, deployers, and users of AI systems while ensuring that the security of the system includes mechanisms against malicious attacks specific to AI. This includes tampering of datasets, malware, and protection against any attacks that is designed to reverse engineer personal data used to train the AI.
Robustness and Reliability
AI systems should be sufficiently robust to cope with errors during execution and any unexpected or erroneous input. Rigorous testing should be carried out before the deployment of any AI system to ensure robustness and consistent results across a range of situations and environments.
Human-centricity
AI systems should respect human-centered values and pursue benefits that are important for the society at large. This is more important where the systems are used to make decisions about human or aid them. It is imperative that these systems are designed with the human benefit in mind and do not take advantage of vulnerable individuals.
Privacy and Data Governance
AI systems should have proper mechanisms to ensure data privacy and protection are in place to maintain and protect the quality and integrity of data throughout their entire lifecycle. As such, data protocols should be set up to govern who can access the data and when can the data be accessed. The data lifecycle (way it is collected, stored, generated, and deleted) must comply with applicable data protection laws, data governance legislation, and ethical principles.
Accountability and Integrity
Deployers of AI systems should be accountable for decisions made by the system and ensure compliance with applicable laws and respect for AI ethics and principles. Organizations should adopt clear reporting structures for internal governance, setting out clearly the different kinds of roles and responsibilities for those involved in the AI system lifecycle.
4. Accountability
 While the EU AI Act takes a more risk-based approach with compliance and enforcement regulations, the ASEAN AI Guide is more of a best practice approach with adoption being voluntary. This is as EU is at the more advance stage in regulations while ASEAN is still setting up the approach to AI regulation with Member States at varied levels of regulatory maturity and readiness for AI technologies.
There is no specific section on non-compliance or breaches for accountability under the ASEAN AI Guide.  The EU AI Act however expressly states non-compliance with the EU AI Act to have significant consequences for organizations. The EU AI Office, which has been created to oversee the implementation and enforcement of the EU AI Act, can impose penalties ranging from €7.5 million or 1.5% of global revenue to €35 million or 7% of global revenue.
5. Agility
 Despite that the EU AI Act sets forth express penalties for non-compliance, we must appreciate the language agility in which both the EU AI Act and the ASEAN AI Guide are written.  They both set a clear tone whilst having regard to the fast-changing development of AI.  Having the ability to quicky adapt to changing conditions and new data, any laws, regulation or guidance must be flexible in enabling businesses to respond swiftly to market changes, emerging trends and new opportunities – against balancing the need to protect rights and liberties, promote social welfare, offer best practices with the overall purpose of maintaining social order and adapt to societal needs.

How will EU AI Act influence ASEAN AI regulations
 The EU AI Act has potential to be a blueprint for future AI compliance rules in the region. While the ASEAN AI Guide targets traditional AI systems such as popular search engines and voice assistants, it does not cover generative AI. The EU AI Act clearly stipulates which obligations fall on providers of AI systems and thus helping businesses purchasing AI understand terms and conditions that will need to be amended to reflect the different obligations.
Many Southeast Asian countries are not yet heavily involved in producing AI-based systems and have either launched or in the process of developing national AI strategies and governance frameworks. The ASEAN AI Guide sets out best practices in developing and using AI systems and aligning policy coordination. As part of the digital transformation in the region, ASEAN adopted the ASEAN Digital Masterplan 2025 in 2021 which envisions ASEAN as a leading digital community and economic bloc. The plan emphasizes importance of digital transformation and while not entirely focused on AI, does highlight the need for a harmonized digital policies and regulatory frameworks.
Today, Singapore is a leader in AI regulation within the region. In January 2019, the Infocomm Media Development Authority developed the “Model AI Governance Framework” that provides detailed guidance on responsible AI deployment.
In Thailand, the “Artificial Intelligence Ethics Guidelines” was issued in October 2019.  These guidelines set out principles for the ethical use and deployment of AI across various sectors, ensuring that AI technologies are developed and implemented responsibly and ethically within the country. 
In Malaysia, the “National AI Framework” was launched in 2022 by the Government of Malaysia to support the ethical and responsible use of AI technologies. The framework, part of Malaysia’s National Artificial Intelligence Roadmap for 2021-2015, underscores Malaysia’s strategic commitment to ethical AI, aiming to harness AI’s transformative potential while ensuring fairness and transparency in its deployment.
At the time of writing this review, we are unaware of any other Southeast Asian country that has issued similar framework or guidelines except for Vietnam that is in process of developing its AI regulations to address the ethical use of AI.  These efforts reflect a growing recognition of the need to balance the economic benefits of AI with its ethical implications, promoting responsible AI use across the region.

What should the region do?
 The EU AI Act and the ASEAN AI Guide share several similarities in their approach to regulating and guiding the ethical use of AI.  Both frameworks emphasize responsible AI deployment and aim to ensure that AI technologies are aligned with societal values and ethical principles.  Key similarities include:

Both EU and ASEAN have their own versions of AI regulations, with EU being more stringent with far-reaching implications. It is important for organizations to understand the impact the Act will have on their business, especially those that sell, import, distribute or plan AI products that are used within the EU as it will be the standard to follow and conform to.
As the region continues to evolve and the need for AI grows, ASEAN will need a more comprehensive regulatory framework to complement the Guide. In this, ASEAN can look towards the EU AI Act to align their strategies and influence their AI regulations. ASEAN can look towards the EU AI Act to whether it could be a model that they want to emulate. This will also depend on how technology evolves and the impact the EU AI Act has.
Even though the full provisions on the EU AI Act have yet to come into force, it is still good for organizations to develop a compliance AI strategy together with a business-focused AI strategy. As countries and territories across the region are at different stages on their digital growth, both the EU AI Act and the ASEAN AI Guide can offer guidance on how to navigate the ever-evolving AI landscape. While the AI Guide takes a non-binding approach to AI development the EU AI Act has financial implications for non-compliance. Organizations across the region should  ensure that their AI trajectory can navigate the challenges and harness opportunities presented by both set of regulations.

On 8 December 2024, the FCA announced plans
opens in a new tab
to end the binary position for customers when making pension decisions of either relying on factual information or obtaining regulated advice. A new proposed regime Targeted Support gives a middle ground option allowing firms to better indicate and ‘nudge’ suggested actions for clients to consider. This paper covers pension accumulation and decumulation products – although another consultation for retail investments will follow in H1 2025.
The FCA is also separately seeking views
opens in a new tab
on whether more changes might be needed to better support pension consumers on (i) the use of projections, tools and models, (ii) enhancing expectations on the consolidation of pension pots and (iii) creating a more robust and prescriptive framework for operating SIPPs.

At a glance
 The Proposal
Firms can provide more tailored and directional messaging to help customers make better informed pension decisions leading to improved retirement outcomes.
The Opportunity
Firms can provide specific interventions to help consumers get better pension outcomes and develop commercial opportunities to drive increased investing.
The Risks
It will require high data accuracy, robust controls and oversight, regular monitoring, It will also create a need for a robust audit trail and rigorous management of conflicts of interest.

KPMG’s initial insights

The paper will be well received. It will enable firms to provide more support to customers when making complex choices which will improve their retirement outcomes. This will also create commercial opportunities for the firm (by targeting increased pensions savings, diversification of fund solutions away from defaults or identifying alternate retirement solutions). 
However, it creates an inherent conflict of interest that firms will need to manage to ensure they are effectively balancing their own commercial interests with good customer outcomes. The obligations in relation to pre-defining scenarios and consumer segments will require careful consideration. Firms will also need to ensure they have right balance (and accuracy) of data to allow them to correctly verify if the solution will meet the firm’s self-generated definition of a ‘better outcome’.

What’s the FCA ambition?

How could the regime work in practice?

The proposed regime is designed to empower customers to make more informed decisions – leading to better outcomes. Therefore, the link to Consumer Duty is clear and Consumer Duty fundamentally underpins Targeted Support. Indeed, many firms have experienced frustrations at following through on fully aligning to the Duty for fear of overstepping into inadvertently giving regulated advice.
Targeted Support is not intended as a replacement for regulated advice and is intended to be complementary – either helping those unwilling (or unable) to pay for advice to make an informed decision or act as a conduit for those with complex needs to identify their need for regulated advice. Although symbiotic, the paper highlights the risk of customers misunderstanding Targeted Support as advice.

Commentary
Better outcomes concept
Targeted Support introduces a new concept of better outcomes. Firms will need to have reasonable grounds for believing that the delivery of targeted support suggestions would deliver a better outcome for their customers than if targeted support was not provided.
Types of support
Firms can provide Targeted Support to new customers as well as support existing customers with both accumulation and decumulation decisions. The FCA will not prescribe the scenarios that can be developed for Targeted Support.
Understanding
the customer
Operates on a consumer segment (akin to a target market) level to make suggestions based on ‘consumers with common circumstances’ and therefore the solution, limited suite of data, customer verification and associated regulatory burden will be lower than for simplified and holistic advice.
Consumer Segments
No limit to number of segments that firms can develop but they much be sufficiently granular with associated data points. Too little prescription and it is more challenging to evidence a ‘better outcome’ but too much prescription and it risks becoming an implicit recommendation.
Range of
solutions
FCA will give firms freedom to define their own ready-made solutions. Firms can suggest a single new product the customer could choose based on ‘people in your circumstances’. This option would narrow the choice significantly for the customer.
Verification
Firms will need to check that customers align with the common characteristics of the consumer segment (and therefore the ready-made solution is appropriate). This process will include validating that the data used is correct and up to date.
Fees and
charges
Firms will be able to cross subsidise. from other services or products provided by the firm as part of their broader proposition. Firms will not have to charge for Targeted Support but equally no commission can be paid or received either.
Basis of provision
FCA wants Targeted Support to operate on an opt-out basis. It is liaising with ICO to assess impact. FCA is also seeking views on whether the provision of Targeted Support by pension providers should be mandatory.
Exclusions
Due to risk of confusion, FCA’s view is that advice firms should not offer Targeted Support to its advised customers – and neither should pension providers.
The outcomes of any Targeted Support cannot suggest a specific annuity. It can only indicate an annuity as a ‘method of access’.
Disclosure
Firms need to deliver effective (and detailed disclosure) to ensure consumer understanding of the service provision (and its limitations). Aligned to the Duty, the FCA is currently reluctant to mandate the disclosure of Targeted Support, but it does recognise that some standardisation may be necessary.
Permissions
FCA is still undecided whether Targeted Support will require new regulatory permissions. However, regardless the intention is for Targeted Support to fall within the remit of both FOS and FSCS.
Oversight
Not a ‘set and forget’ process. Firms are expected to adapt and refine segments and solutions as new scenarios and groups emerge (especially in relation to customers with indicators of vulnerability). As a minimum, firms must review annually.
Record Keeping
Firms will be required to keep copies of all communication and interactions to evidence the key messages and features delivered as well as the outcomes being delivered.

What are the key opportunities?

How will firms seek to embrace Targeted Support?
Firms will recognise that there are a significant number of opportunities that the new Targeted Support regime will generate. These can not only improve customer outcomes but also generate commercial benefits for the firm. It can allow firms to increase customer loyalty, gain incremental revenue from increased contributions, amended retirement age or alternate fund choices as well as attract new pension savers.
The associated inherent conflict of interest will need to be carefully managed but Targeted Support, when done right, offers an exciting opportunity for firms to embrace.
Support customers with uncertainty about how to take a retirement income
Encourage existing savers with surplus cash holdings (but no pension provision) to consider planning for their retirement via a new personal pension.
Nudge customers with a high withdrawal rate within drawdown to consider the consequences and risk of running out of money and suggest a more appropriate withdrawal rate.
Highlight to existing pension customers the benefits of making increased pension contributions to a specific percentage of earnings and the impact it can have on retirement benefits.
Nudge pension customers invested into the default fund to make a more proactive and informed decision about their investment preference and time horizons towards a more appropriate investment solution.
Raise awareness to customers approaching selected retirement age but still heavily invested in equities to choose an alternative less volatile solution and/or opt into an appropriate investment pathway/lifestyle profile.

What are the key risks?

What are key risks that firms will need to mitigate to make Targeted Support a success?
Double the boundaries to worry about. Firms will now need to ensure that information and guidance does not stray into targeted support and that targeted support does not stray into advice. Given the more subjective nature of targeted support (versus advice) this added complexity may mean that firms stop short of what targeted support permits them to do – thereby reducing its effectiveness.
Unintended consequences? The FCA has highlighted concerns about Targeted Support creating misunderstanding for advised customers. There is a risk that this may adversely impact vertically integrated firms – especially where they have a single brand.
Evidential bar for better outcomes? Although expected by the FCA, it will represent a significant challenge for firms to evidence the delivery of better outcomes even if the customer did not act on the Targeted Support.
Seeking the ‘Goldilocks’ of data. Firms will need to finely balance in the level of data they use – too little and it will not be able to evidence better outcomes but using too much risks straying into advice.
Uneven playing field? Give the exclusion of customer buying a specific annuity via Targeted Support, it creates an uneven playing field and may lead to more Targeted Support towards drawdown contracts. That said, given the high complexity and elements of irreversibility, could the risk of poor outcomes exceed a firm’s risk appetite to offer Targeted Support?
Not having a broader scope will likely impact use. Not expanding the scope of the regime to cover all other retail products (e.g. insurance and mortgages) is a missed opportunity as it will hamper some firms offering as holistic a service as they could. Targeted Support by its design is also product focussed when many of the right outcomes may not be.
Tantamount to advice? Despite the new proposals, given the personalisation taking place and the ability for firms to offer a single solution (currently both within perimeter guidance as indicators of advice) there will need to be clearer demarcation from advice. This will help firms, FCA and FOS alike.
Greater risk consideration needed for new sales. Firms will need to recognise and address the multiple different risk considerations (especially given the lack of upfront customer data) of seeking sales with new customers versus serving existing customers with targeted support. The former will require significantly more consideration.
Firms will need to avoid judgment. Where the Targeted Support is being delivered in real time, (especially with a decision tree model via chat or telephone) firms will need to avoid providing judgement. To manage the risk of straying into advice, targeted support will need to be driven purely by client choice.
Need for digitalisation may adversely impact those with vulnerabilities. To be as effective as possible targeted support should be support by open finance and operate on a digital first basis. However, both factors risk poorer outcomes for customers with vulnerable characteristics. Firms will need to be vigilant that any targeted solution does not disadvantage vulnerable customers and that they receive the same outcomes as other customers

In the era before cloud technology, information technology outsourcers (ITOs) used to pitch their services as ""we'll run your mess for less."" This referred to the complexities of managing on-premises solutions, including data centers, network infrastructure, servers, operating systems, applications, databases, and security. The promise was to deliver the same level of software application availability (99.999%) while reducing costs and minimizing headaches through economies of scale and offshoring.
However, the rise of Software as a Service (SaaS) has disrupted this model. Cloud software providers now handle a significant portion of the ""mess,"" but not all.
While they take care of the infrastructure and applications, your IT department is still responsible for configurations, data management, feature customization, deployment of new functionality, identity, and security setups, and other factors specific to your company's use of the software capabilities.

A model of shared responsibility

Today, IT's role has evolved. It is no longer solely focused on delivering a software application with high availability. Instead, IT's deliverable is a cloud platform that is finely tuned to drive business outcomes. These outcomes include enhanced employee satisfaction and retention, accelerated decision-making, improved demand forecasting, reduced inventory costs, minimized fraud, and decreased waste.
IT departments are also facing increasing pressure to integrate cloud platforms with generative AI, connect various data sources for advanced analytics, and foster innovation and resilience throughout the organization.

Now is the time for IT to become a business catalyst

In this rapidly changing landscape, IT must transform from being perceived as a mere cost center to becoming a strategic business catalyst. By leveraging cloud technology and embracing its potential, IT can drive innovation, enable agility, and unlock new opportunities for growth.

GHG 101: The fundamentals

Climate-related disclosure requirements from the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) and the EU are shaping the global climate reporting landscape. Although different in many ways, these requirements share a common factor: greenhouse gas emissions. 
More companies than ever before will face regulatory requirements to report the direct and indirect emissions associated with their operations. And we expect this reporting to be heavily informed by the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. 
The Protocol provides the underlying principles, concepts and methods to develop a greenhouse gas emissions inventory that can be used for various voluntary or mandatory reporting purposes.
Finance professionals play a valuable role in bridging between scientific data and investor-quality information. And because of the Protocol’s influence on the future of emissions reporting, it is becoming more important for finance professionals to understand the fundamentals of greenhouse gas emissions reporting.

And as data grows across users, devices and cloud applications, so does the need for security and compliance.
In fact, cybersecurity and data privacy are two of the top issues on the 2024 board agenda
opens in a new tab
, because as the cloud makes data easier for business teams to access, it also creates risk for data breaches, exposure of sensitive data, and regulatory challenges.
That’s why progressive companies develop an approach to data protection before moving it to the cloud. They determine ways to embed security, privacy, and compliance in their target operating model — including processes, behaviors, technology, and other areas.

An ongoing process

These companies also consider how to continue integrating and protecting data after the launch of a cloud platform, as the business evolves. Some are getting help from leading managed services providers, who have deep expertise in data security, cybersecurity, and regulatory compliance.
These providers can help companies continually optimize their approach to data protection, with key actions such as:
Classifying the different kinds of data in the enterprise. With organizational data growing at an exponential rate, the best providers determine the right security approach by evaluating which data is mission-critical, the degree of sensitivity and privacy, the location, the compliance requirements, and the appropriate level of access. And since much of the data lives in cloud applications, these applications should be continually tested for vulnerabilities. 
Embedding data protection into development. In addition to testing applications, it’s important to embed data security into the development of them. This enables organizations to deploy applications quickly—whether it’s a new customer app or a real-time collaboration tool—with confidence that data is being protected.
Leading managed services providers can also embed data privacy into AI development processes and training data, as regulators are increasingly concerned about the mining and harvesting of personal data for AI algorithms.
Continually integrating data. For real-time analytics, it’s becoming essential to move data to the cloud, but with each launch of a cloud platform, companies must also be prepared for ongoing work in data integration, security, and systems connectivity. Savvy managed services providers can take responsibility for these domains as part of the long-term optimization of cloud platforms. They also have expertise in data lineage and other parts of data governance, which are drawing heightened scrutiny from regulators.

As data proliferates across the enterprise through the cloud, companies need an operating model for continually protecting it. Managed services can be a compelling option.

When you can bounce back from disruption, you can grow with confidence. And when you earn the trust of regulators, customers, and other stakeholders, they give you the permission to make bold moves, from product launches to market expansion.
That’s why progressive companies align their risk strategies to their growth goals, while ensuring they can manage fast-evolving risks. Two of the biggest, according to the KPMG 2023 Chief Risk Officer Survey
opens in a new tab
, are regulatory changes and cybersecurity.

An emerging operating model

In response, nearly 90 percent of CROs in the US survey said they plan to increase their risk management budgets over the next 12 months, and about a third of them are considering outsourcing strategies to help. 
One such strategy is managed services. In this model, leading service providers are not transactional processors. They are strategic collaborators who combine advanced tech, data management, sector expertise, and advisory capabilities to deliver critical risk processes — packaged in a multi-year subscription with predictable costs.
Modern providers drive growth-enabling outcomes like stakeholder trust, customer retention, organizational agility, and operational resilience — while also reducing the cost of operations.

Top hurdles in the next two to five years

In the survey, 42 percent of CROs said that regulatory compliance issues, marked by increasing scrutiny from regulators, are their most significant challenge, while 38% cited cybersecurity. Managed services are helping on both fronts:
1. Compliance risk comes in the form of new and emerging regulations, noncompliance with existing regulations, and a company’s relationship with regulators. It can be especially challenging for multinational organizations since jurisdictional regulations — from General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to Know Your Customer (KYC) — can change on a dime.
With the right tech and talent, leading providers can automate policies, perform ongoing analysis, continually evolve them to meet new requirements, integrate compliance tech with core business systems, and more. Outcomes can include faster customer onboarding, enhanced reputation, and agile adaptation to market change.
2. Cyber threats and data breaches, meanwhile, have a way of slowing down a company’s growth ambitions. That’s why some firms are seeking providers with capabilities like 24x7 monitoring, hypothesis-driven threat hunting, and a single-pane view that unifies all alerts, investigations, threat intelligence, and controls into one source of cybersecurity truth.
These providers can take responsibility for ongoing threat detection, containment and response, as well as related areas like application security, data protection, and identity & access management. Results can range from faster software development to higher customer loyalty to confidence in launching new services.
In a volatile business environment, risk functions must continually improve their effectiveness and efficiency, while also supporting the growth strategy. In some cases, that requires a new operating model, and managed services is a key consideration.

Highlights

– What are the amendments for the own-use exemption?
– What are the amendments for hedge accounting?
– What are the new disclosure requirements?
– Effective from 1 January 2026

Companies face challenges in applying IFRS 9 Financial Instruments to contracts referencing nature-dependent electricity – sometimes referred to as renewable power purchase agreements (PPAs). The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) has now amended IFRS 9 to address these challenges. The amendments1 include guidance on:
the ‘own-use’ exemption for purchasers of electricity under such PPAs2; and
hedge accounting requirements for companies that hedge their purchases or sales of electricity using PPAs.
The IASB has also added new disclosure requirements for certain PPAs to IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures and IFRS 19 Subsidiaries without Public Accountability: Disclosures.

What are the amendments for the own-use exemption?

It is not always clear under IFRS 9 whether a company that purchases electricity through PPAs can apply the own-use exemption for accounting purposes. If the own-use exemption does not apply, then PPAs are accounted for as derivatives measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL). PPAs are often long-term agreements, so measuring them at FVTPL can potentially create significant volatility in the income statement over many reporting periods.
To apply the own-use exemption to a PPA, IFRS 9 currently requires companies to assess whether the contract is for receipt of electricity in line with the company’s expected purchase or usage requirements – e.g. the purchaser expects to use the quantity it buys, and then actually uses it.
The challenge arises due to the unique characteristics of electricity, including the difficulty to store it, and its market structure – i.e. if a purchasing company is not able to use the electricity within a short period, the electricity has to be sold back to the market within a specified time. Although these sales occur because of the market structure, and not to profit from short-term price fluctuations, it is unclear if the company can apply the own-use exemption under existing requirements.
The amendments allow a company to apply the own-use exemption to PPAs if the company has been, and expects to be, a net-purchaser of electricity for the contract period.
The amendments apply retrospectively using facts and circumstances at the beginning of the reporting period of initial application (without requiring prior periods to be restated).

What are the amendments for hedge accounting?

Virtual PPAs3 and PPAs that do not meet the own-use exemption are accounted for as derivatives and measured at FVTPL. Applying hedge accounting could help companies to reduce profit or loss volatility by reflecting how these PPAs hedge the price of future electricity purchases or sales.
Under IFRS 9, to apply hedge accounting there needs to be an economic offset between changes in the value of hedging instruments and hedged transactions.
Buyers and sellers of PPAs face challenges when applying cash flow hedge accounting under IFRS 9. This is because the fair value of the hedging instrument (PPA) is based on a P50 estimate4, but the hedged transaction is required to be based on a P90 estimate5 due to the requirement for a hedged transaction to be highly probable. This creates a mismatch that could lead to the hedging relationship not qualifying for hedge accounting.

Subject to certain conditions, the amendments permit companies to designate a variable nominal volume of forecasted sales or purchases of renewable electricity as the hedged transaction, rather than a fixed volume based on P90 estimates. The variable hedged volume is based on the variable volume expected to be delivered by the generation facility referenced in the hedging instrument. This would facilitate an economic offset between the hedging instrument and the hedged transaction, enabling companies to apply hedge accounting.
The amendments apply prospectively to new hedging relationships designated on or after the date of initial application. They also allow companies to discontinue an existing hedging relationship, if the same hedging instrument (i.e. the nature-dependent electricity contract) is designated in a new hedging relationship applying the amendments.

What are the new disclosure requirements?

A company may apply the own-use exemption to certain PPAs under the amendments and therefore would not recognise these PPAs in its statement of financial position. Where this is the case, a company is required to disclose further information such as:
contractual features exposing the company to variability in electricity volume and risk of oversupply;
estimated future cash flows from unrecognised contractual commitments to buy electricity in appropriate time bands;
qualitative information about how the company assessed whether a contract might become onerous; and
qualitative and quantitative information about the costs and proceeds associated with purchases and sales of electricity, based on the information used for the ‘net-purchaser’ assessment.
In addition, for PPAs designated in a cash flow hedging relationship, companies need to disaggregate the information disclosed about terms and conditions by risk category.

Effective from 1 January 2026

The amendments apply for reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2026.
Early application is permitted. To find out more about the amendments, speak to your KPMG contact.

1 The amendments apply only to contracts referencing nature-dependent electricity in which a company ‘is exposed to variability in the underlying amount of electricity because the source of electricity generation depends on uncontrollable natural conditions (e.g. the weather)’.
2 For the purposes of this article, when the term PPA is used it refers only to PPAs in scope of the amendments (refer to footnote 1).
3 A virtual PPA (vPPA) is a contract for difference where the purchaser and the seller net settle periodically in cash for each unit of power generated (on the basis of the difference between the fixed price agreed at contract inception and the current spot market price on each periodic settlement date). If the fixed price exceeds the spot price, then the purchaser pays the difference to the seller and vice versa. Under vPPAs, there are no physical transfers of power and hence the own-use exemption does not apply.
4 A P50 estimate indicates the volume of energy production expected to be exceeded with 50 percent probability.
5 A P90 estimate indicates the volume of energy production expected to be exceeded with 90 percent probability. By definition, the P90 volume estimate will be lower than the P50 estimate.

A KPMG-guided SAP S/4HANA transformation can help enable that growth.

Expectations in finance are evolving

Many insurers are looking to their finance function to support multiple business imperatives and propel their modernization journeys.
Leaders want deeper insights to support long-term planning, a robust and connected performance management framework, and real-time analytics to unlock value from short-term disruption. The finance function’s role in supporting insurers’ path through increasingly complex regulation and reporting requirements, including ESG, is also growing.
As the landscape changes, the need for an integrated approach to technology, data and people is vital. But for many insurers’ their systems and processes could be holding them back. For example:
Insurers’ IT systems may still exist on legacy platforms that restrict agility and obscure value opportunities
Complex manual processes that are time-intensive rely too heavily on talent in an in-flux job market
Poorly stored and quantified data may be constraining many organizations’ growth potential, a long-term problem that has restricted insurers’ ability to steer a course for success

Many leaders are looking to digital transformation to overcome these shortcomings. SAP S/4HANA, a multi-dimensional cloud ERP, cuts across functions to unify systems and processes, deliver real-time capabilities, and enable new technologies like AI to drive enterprise-wide efficiencies.

On Tuesday 17 December, the European Central Bank (ECB) published its updated supervisory priorities for the years 2025 – 2027
opens in a new tab
. As every year, this update is based on an extensive evaluation of the key risks and vulnerabilities confronting significant institutions under its direct supervision. It also takes into account the advancements achieved in addressing priorities from previous years, alongside the findings of the 2024 Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process
opens in a new tab
(SREP), which were published on the same day. The ECB also published their methodologies for some elements of the SREP, continuing their recent move towards more transparency of their supervisory processes.
As in prior years, the priorities begin with a positive tone – the ECB once again acknowledges that European banks are reporting strong capital and liquidity positions, that asset quality has continued to show resilience in the face of a challenging macro-financial environment, and that profitability has reached an all-time high since the inception of EU banking supervision.
However, despite this resilience, the ECB emphasises the need for prudence, in particular given the persistently high geopolitical tensions and the resulting uncertainty surrounding the macroeconomic outlook. As in previous years, the ECB calls for banks to stay vigilant in the face of several emerging challenges, and to ensure that they regularly assess any implications that they could face due to such events. In light of this ‘cross-cutting nature of geopolitical shocks’ the ECB specifically highlights the requirement for a ‘holistic supervisory strategy’ going forward. It is clear that over the next few years the ECB will focus on supervised institutions’ ability to withstand these shocks.
Building on this holistic strategy, the ECB calls for banks to further strengthen their efforts to address material shortcomings that have already been identified by supervisors in previous cycles. Unsurprisingly, risk data aggregation and risk reporting (RDARR) is called out specifically and once again the ECB points to expectations around full compliance with climate-related and environmental (C&E) risks as a priority. Looking towards future technological advances, the ECB underscores the importance of banks enhancing their digitalisation efforts and improving the management of risks associated with the adoption of new technologies.
Against this background, the ECB priorities for 2025 – 2027 are threefold. Each addresses a specific set of prioritised vulnerabilities for which dedicated strategic objectives have been set and work programmes have been developed. KPMG professionals have summarised the three priorities, the associated vulnerabilities, plus the special focus on geopolitical risks that those three overarching priorities seek to address:
Figure 1: ECB supervisory priorities for 2025 – 2027

Source: ECB Banking Supervision, 2024

A recurring theme across all three priorities is the ECB’s special focus on geopolitical risks - indeed, the first priority names this as a key factor. Specific examples identified in the first priority include deficiencies in credit risk management frameworks, operational resilience frameworks (in particular DORA compliance, IT outsourcing and IT security/cyber risks) and the specific incorporation of the management of geopolitical risks in supervisory priorities. This special focus will be assessed via a range of activities, especially with respect to the way in which it is captured within credit and operational risks by banks. The ECB also states that banks should expect this to be a key component of the 2025 EU-wide stress test.
In the context of the second priority, the ECB has built upon previous years’ priorities to insist upon the remediation of persistent material shortcomings identified in the course of extensive supervisory scrutiny over the last few years. Two areas were specifically referenced (i) strategies and management of C&E risks and (ii) RDARR capabilities. Reiterating statements made throughout 2024 the ECB highlights its readiness to use all available escalation tools where necessary, and mentions specifically periodic penalty payments and use of sanctions for C&E risks and RDARR respectively.
Lastly, the third priority echoes similar themes to prior year, focusing on strengthening digitalisation strategies and emerging challenges from the use of new technologies. Here the ECB recognises the need for banking supervisors to develop targeted strategies in order to better understand banks’ responses to many of these topics, including the use of AI.

What do the priorities mean for banks and what do KPMG professionals recommend?
For each priority, the ECB has outlined its key supervisory activities that it intends to undertake for each vulnerability. KPMG Banking and Financial Services professionals offer the following recommendations for what banks can do now to meet ECB expectations for each priority are:
Priority 1: Banks should strengthen their ability to withstand immediate macro-financial threats and severe geopolitical shocks resilience to immediate macro-financial and geopolitical shocks
Strengthen and reinforce procedures, policies and processes around the identification, analysis, monitoring and management of geopolitical risks for example by means of scenario analyses; ensure geopolitical risks are appropriately included in risk appetite frameworks.
Prepare for a targeted benchmarking exercise on risk appetite and risk culture focusing on reflecting the implication that geopolitical risks have for banks’ risk identification and risk appetite framework.
Ensure sufficient preparation for the 2025 EU-wide stress tests, in light of the ECB’s statement that geopolitical risks will be a key component, and that the exercise will include an exploratory scenario analysis assessing banks’ ability to model counterparty credit risk while under stress.
Continue to be prepared for the follow-up phase on the targeted review of IFRS 9, focused on overlays and coverage of novel risks (including geopolitical risks) and SME portfolios, as well as further OSIs on credit risk topics such as retail and CRE portfolios, including collateral valuations.
Focus on the implementation of DORA in the supervisory framework, alongside follow-up work on the findings from the 2024 cyber resilience stress test.
Get ready for collection of data on third party ICT providers with a view that the ECB understands the links between banks and providers, potentially identifying concentration risks and/or weaknesses in banks’ outsourcing arrangements. This could also include a targeted review on such frameworks.
Prepare for targeted OSIs on operational risk, DORA compliance and IT resilience.
Priority 2: Banks should remedy persistent material shortcomings in an effective and timely manner
Be ready to demonstrate and actively monitor full alignment with supervisory expectations on a range of topics.
Assess ability to address reputational and litigation risks associated with C&E activities, and be ready for deep dives on a stand-alone basis. Targeted OSIs on C&E will continue on a stand-alone or as part of other on-site inspections (e.g.: credit risk, operational risk, business model).
Get ready and prepare documentation for the upcoming horizontal assessment of banks’ compliance with Pillar 3 disclosure requirements related to ESG risks.
Prepare documentation and adequate resources to respond to the annual questionnaire Production of the Management Report on Data Governance and Data Quality.
Assess progress with respect to persistent risk data aggregation and reporting deficiencies, especially with respect to the supervisory expectations related to the implementation of risk data aggregation and risk reporting principles based on the final publication in 2024. Banks should expect a continuation of the OSI campaign in the RDARR space, including the potential use of escalation tools where necessary. 
Priority 3: Banks should strengthen their digitalisation strategies and tackle emerging challenges stemming from the use of new technologies  
Expect targeted deep-dives on digital transformation impacts on banks’ business models/strategies and risks on use of innovative technologies. This could include targeted OSIs on digital transformation, both from and IT and business model perspective.
Keep-in mind the 2024 publication of supervisory expectations and sharing of best practices on digital transformation strategies.
Finally, the ECB has included a section that describes how they will continue other supervisory activities and follow-up on past priorities. All-in-all this publication has demonstrated the comprehensive way in which the ECB is approaching supervision over the next few years. In short, at a minimum, KPMG professionals would advise banks to analyse the priorities, identify the most challenging areas and the ones where supervisory activities have been already communicated as part of their supervisory examination plans and develop action plans to prepare themselves in advance. KPMG professionals take note that for the last years, the ECB has continued to escalate its willingness to use the full supervisory toolkit at its disposal, including the use of penalty payment and other sanctions where progress is not adequate. As in prior year, the Priorities 2025 – 2027 reinforce that this is the new normal – banks should focus on those persistent shortcomings in their own portfolios and employ strategies for swift and effective remediation.

Highlights

– What’s the issue?
– What’s the impact?
– What’s next? Read our guide on how the requirements compare

Sustainability reporting is developing quickly, with new requirements2 from the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB), EU and US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
The aim of the ISSBTM Standards is to create a global baseline for investor-focused sustainability reporting that local jurisdictions can build on.

What’s the issue?

There is some commonality among the requirements – including that the TCFD3 framework forms a shared input.
However, there are also areas where they are not aligned, which will create practical challenges for companies trying to design coherent and consistent reporting that is internationally comparable, but also meets local needs.
In addition to points of detail, differences include the greater scope and scale of the ESRSs with their wider stakeholder focus.

What’s the impact?

The requirements are ambitious and will have a significant impact on companies. For multinationals and others needing to apply multiple frameworks, there are many potential challenges. 
For companies, interoperability is going to be a real challenge for those preparing a coherent narrative on what is important to their business. 
Companies may also have to provide different and more detailed information depending on the frameworks applicable to them.
For investors and other stakeholders, the differing requirements will make comparisons between companies and decision making more challenging.

What’s next?

Read our guide (PDF 1 MB) to gain further insight on some of the practical challenges you may encounter as you prepare for the new sustainability reporting standards.
1. Understand if and when the requirements apply to you, or whether you will choose to apply them voluntarily.
2. Understand where similarities and differences exist between the requirements that may affect you.
3. Identify the information you will need to disclose to provide a coherent narrative.
4. Prepare for fast adoption of multiple sets of requirements that may affect your company. 
Our dedicated ISSB Standards Today page will keep you up to date with the latest developments in this area.
Our ISSB Standards digital hub and ESRS Today page will provide practical guidance to help you get ready for the new standards. These resources capture the latest thinking together with our insight.

https://kpmg.com/xx/en/our-insights/value-creation/m-and-a-outlook-2025.html,Value Creation,M&A outlook 2025,,"Having turned a corner in 2024, global M&A deal activity should pick up momentum through 2025. Here’s what deal makers should expect from the year ahead.

Starting on an upward trajectory

2024 was somewhat of a turnaround year for global M&A markets. Deal volume was down around 17 percent. Total deal value was up, but largely on the back of 89 megadeals worth a combined US$1,034 billion. The pace of trade in smaller deals (those under US$500 million) dropped off in terms of both value and volume. Many Private Equity (PE) firms struggled to close new funds.
The US Fed’s rate cut in September brought cautious optimism to dealmaking markets. PE activity increased in 2024, fueled by stable interest rates, decelerating inflation and a record amount of dry powder. Valuation gaps started to close and traditional lenders and private credit funds started offering better financing terms.

We expect deal activity to continue to pick up through the first half of 2025 as dealmakers rebalance their portfolios and corporates restructure their value chains to reflect new trade and geopolitical trends. Pressure on PEs to return capital to investors should lead to heightened activity driven by increased portfolio company divestment and strategies. And the urge to capitalize on trending opportunities will likely drive increased investment into AI-related assets. Barring the unexpected, we expect dealmaking activity to build through 2025.

Tracking top deal markets

While the Americas attracted around half of the total deal value in 2024, the biggest gains were had in the Japan (up 54 percent) followed by Europe (which was up by 31 percent) and Middle East and Africa (which saw a 19 percent rise in deal values). The Americas grew by just 6 percent. However, there was decline in Asia-Pacific (ASPAC) region by 5 percent.
We expect to see broad growth in dealmaking activity in 2025. The Americas will likely see a sharp increase as corporates and PE managers assess their exposure to potential tariffs and trade risks. More megadeals should further bolster activity in the US. Europe should continue to grow at pace, likely led by divestments and portfolio reshaping activity. And, despite a slight decline in deal values over 2024, we expect to see ASPAC become more of an investment haven through 2025.

The sectors making big deals

One might expect a 30 percent jump in deal values within the High Technology sector to spark a strong rally. Yet deal volumes fell nearly 27 percent in the same period. Anecdotal evidence suggests deal activity continues to be driven by AI-inspired investments & cybersecurity resulting in fewer deals, but at higher valuations. Even so, High Tech accounted for 20 percent of overall global M&A volume in 2024, netting a cumulative value of some US$516 billion.
Perhaps displaying a more cautious outlook, investors largely focused on more traditional deals and sectors. In 2024, Financial Services saw cumulative deal values rise 39 percent; the Consumer sector was up by 18 percent; the Retail sector saw values increase 68 percent.
Interestingly, the biggest deals of the year were captured not by tech firms, but by Energy and Power companies (three of the top 10 deals), Media and Entertainment & Telecommunication (two of the top 10) and Consumer Goods and Retail (two of the top 10).
Looking into 2025, we expect to see strong growth in dealmaking within the Technology, Media & Telecommunication sector (driven by continued AI fever), Infrastructure (particularly related to cities and population growth), Financial Services (driven by the need for scale and innovation), and Consumer and Retail (focused around large carve outs).

Private equity is back in the driver’s seat

Private equity returned to the deal markets in 2024. PE-backed buyouts accounted for 24 percent of M&A total value globally, up from 21 percent in 2023. Deal value grew by 22 percent to US$781 billion. With more than US$2.9 trillion in dry powder sitting on the sidelines, fundraising timelines have started to stretch – hitting 18 months in many cases, versus 14 months a year earlier. Exits may be up in 2024, but overall PE-backed deal volume is down 29 percent on the year. Buy/sell gaps remain wider than many would like.
2025 will bring a change in market conditions. Valuation gaps will continue to narrow, providing PE with more opportunities for successful exits. Dry powder will start to be deployed, particularly as interest rates steady and inflation continues to decline. Efforts to achieve organic value creation within portfolio companies should help to bolster valuations and returns. The M&A tide is turning towards strategic expansions and leveraged buyouts, with private equity activity surging on the back of low premiums on risky debt.

Maximizing the deal with value creation

This year, we expect improved market conditions – driven by narrowing valuation gaps, economic stability and favorable monetary policies – to set the stage for increased deal activity. Bigger deals will likely continue to dominate, reflecting stronger corporate confidence. Private equity firms should drive significant activity as they look to capitalize on lower interest rates and healthier portfolios.
As such, we expect to see leading dealmakers increase their focus on value creation throughout the deal lifecycle. Indeed, by strengthening portfolio companies, leveraging operational efficiencies and aligning market expectations, many managers are pulling critical transformational levers that are helping them to expand revenue, enhance efficiency and achieve substantial growth in the evolving market landscape.

Get ready for an active 2025

Our view suggests that 2025 will bring a significant uptick in the pace of deal activity across markets and sectors. We see positive signs in the macroeconomic data, the confidence of Private Equity managers and the narrowing valuation gap. With nearly US$3 trillion in dry powder, we expect 2025 to bring significant capital deployment – both financial and strategic – as players seek to proactively and reactively transform to meet changing market conditions.
Our advice to dealmakers is to start quantifying the value of your assets and deals early, using reliable data and experienced insight. Big opportunities should emerge this year. Make sure you are ready to take advantage.

https://kpmg.com/xx/en/our-insights/risk-and-regulation/pra-consults-on-extensive-liquidity-reporting-for-insurers.html,Risk and Regulation,PRA consults on extensive liquidity reporting for insurers,,"December 2024
The PRA is seeking to improve its framework for monitoring and supervising liquidity risk and has proposed new requirements for nine large insurers. Recent market stresses highlighted ‘critical gaps’ in liquidity reporting, hampering supervisors’ ability to assess firms’ liquidity exposures and responses in a stress scenario.
The PRA has identified shortcomings in its current liquidity risk reporting framework, particularly in light of recent market stress events such as the volatility in the UK gilt market in September 2022 and associated challenges. The PRA is enhancing its reporting requirements, building upon the existing liquidity risk management expectations outlined in SS5/19. This will provide it with a more comprehensive understanding of insurers' liquidity positions and enable more effective oversight, with the proposed rules coming into effect on 31 December 2025. 
CP19/24
opens in a new tab
introduces four new liquidity reporting templates to provide the PRA with more timely, consistent, and accurate information on the liquidity positions of large UK insurers with significant derivative or repo exposures. Of these, two cash flow mismatch templates provide for monthly reporting, although the shorter template – containing 150 key data points – can be required by the PRA on a daily basis.
The PRA also proposes to remove the requirement for all life firms with full or partial internal models to submit annual Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR) information calculated using the Standard Formula (SF). While the formal application date for this change would also be 31 December 2025, the PRA is enabling immediate application of the benefits via a temporary delay in submission deadline for firms’ YE2024 SF SCR. To note, this only applies to life firms – general and composite insurers will need to continue to submit the relevant template (SF.01) for the PRA to monitor model drift.
The current consultation is only one part of a series of regulatory changes that have seen the PRA increase its scrutiny of insurers’ financial and operational resilience. Below KPMG in the UK analyses these changes, the impact on insurers, and how we can help.

New liquidity requirements at a glance

The proposed liquidity reporting requirements include two monthly cash flow mismatch templates. The more detailed template covers a range of information on cash flow inflows and outflows from (re)insurance contracts, derivatives and other financial cashflows, as well as information relating to the firm’s asset holdings such as asset class, credit rating, residual maturity and sector.
The PRA seeks to gather a mix of historic and future-looking information, as well as sensitivities to specific market changes. An additional monthly cash flow mismatch template collects a subset of data on the most critical drivers of liquidity strain with a focus on financial transactions. 
In-scope firms will also be required to report annually on committed facilities that might be available to them under stress and quarterly on sensitivity of assets and collateral flows to changes in interest rates, exchange rates, inflation, and gilt and credit spreads.

Scope of the proposals

The new liquidity reporting requirements will apply to firms that have:
More than £20 billion in assets (excluding assets held for index or unit-linked contracts) on average over the last three quarters
and one or both of:
 Gross nominal derivatives exposure of more than £10 billion and/or
Security financing transactions (SFTs) of more than £1 billion

Impact on firms

The PRA proposed templates include 3,000 new data cells, compared to equivalent banking templates of 90,000 data cells. Nevertheless, this will be a step change for large insurance firms from current high level quarterly liquidity reporting– particularly if the PRA moves to request daily reporting of the key 150 data points. The requirement for insurers to submit completed templates not just at solo level, but also for each Ring-Fenced Fund (RFF) and Matching Adjustment Portfolio (MAP), will add to the burden. 
The PRA estimates that the proposals will have a one-off implementation cost of £11 million and additional annual costs of £3.6 million across the nine impacted firms. This compares to current internal liquidity reporting spend of £530,000 per firm. 
The existing liquidity management requirements set out in SS5/19
opens in a new tab
 Liquidity Risk Management for Insurers remain relevant and should continue to guide firms’ approach to liquidity management, supplemented with system and data changes to enable firms to meet the new reporting obligations. 
However, impacted firms will face considerable time pressure to implement changes between the point the rules are finalised (likely Q2 2025) and their application on 31 December 2025.
The requirement for monthly reporting will be new to insurers, and the existing QRT processes, designed for quarterly reporting, may not be suitable to meet the new reporting frequency or the reduced remittance times. Even where insurers are able to leverage current processes, they will still need to make considerable changes to gather and submit the relevant data in the new timeframes. The potential for daily reporting also means that the liquidity data collection / reporting process will likely need to be fully automated.
In addition to these implementation challenges, as with all regulatory reporting, firms will need to ensure that the data they submit is sufficiently extensive and robust for regulatory disclosure.
The proposed changes relate to information gathering but it remains to be seen how the overall approach and scope of liquidity supervision will evolve. Banks will be familiar with how the PRA’s approach to supervision of liquidity risk has enhanced over time, and the same could be true for insurers, with this consultation potentially being the first step in an evolutionary journey.
Additionally, the PRA’s overall approach to insurance supervision has already seen major enhancements in recent years. Liquidity risk is just one of many priority areas that the PRA is focusing on. Regulatory attention on subjects such as funded reinsurance and solvent exit planning highlight the PRA’s increased attention to financial resilience. Operational resilience is also high on the agenda, with the PRA requiring insurers to consider impact tolerances for their important business services.
There is considerable overlap between these topics and impacted firms may want to review how these new liquidity reporting requirements can be supported by or support other areas of development.

Solo entities in-scope with multiple ring-fenced funds (RFFs) or matching adjustment portfolios (MAPs) could limit the fungibility of liquidity around the firm. Therefore, the PRA proposes that firms submit the cash flow mismatch template for each individual RFF, MAP, and the remaining part of the firm, giving a more accurate representation of the availability and location of liquidity within a solo entity

How KPMG in the UK can help

KPMG professionals can help with: 
Liquidity framework and operating mode: reviewing and updating liquidity frameworks and operating models to meet the demands of the upcoming PRA obligations, as well as any business model changes such as BPA activity. 
Modelling and validation: both asset and liability side modelling. Actuarial models can be adapted to provide policyholder liability flows and modelling can be extended to operational cashflows. 
Liquidity & Collateral management: most of the impacted insurers will have collateral management systems sitting alongside the asset management system. These may need to be reviewed to allow data to be retrieved quickly and at the right level of granularity.
Systems/process development: the new PRA liquidity template will likely need finance transformation activity to draw together multiple sources of data for fast and accurate reporting. KPMG professionals can help insurers plan for stressed times and provide liquidity information more quickly to address the PRA’s specific concerns.
Controls environment: fostering a rigorous regulatory reporting control environment. Integration with broader risk and regulatory initiatives: helping firms leverage existing risk and regulatory initiatives such as recovery & resolution, solvent exit planning, enterprise risk management, proactive risk mitigation, improved stress testing, enhanced portfolio management, and tactical asset allocation.

Motor Finance Commission Arrangements

CoA landmark rulings and the implications for firms
The Court of Appeal recently ruled in favour of three customers setting out that ‘a broker could not lawfully receive a commission from a lender without obtaining the customer’s fully informed consent to the payment’.
This broadened (and was distinct from) the discretionary commission (DCA1) issue, currently under investigation by the FCA2, to any undisclosed commission - which must include the amount.
The implications of these decisions can’t be underestimated - we explore what has happened, what it means and the immediate next steps for motor finance firms.

The Backdrop

2021: the FCA banned DCAs on the basis these arrangements provided an incentive for a customer to potentially be charged a higher interest rate. In response, related complaints and County Court cases increase significantly.
Jan 2024: key decisions by the FOS on two DCA complaints were found in favour of the customers. Simultaneously, the FCA launch a review under s166 of historical motor finance commission, to conclude by Sept 2024. Firms were allowed to place DCA complaints on pause until this date.
March 24: cases stemming from the regional courts are given permission to Appeal the decisions of their respective courts, defended by Close Brothers and Firstrand Bank.  
April 24: Barclays Partner Finance launch proceedings for a Judicial Review (JR) of the FOS decision against them basing the challenge on alleged misinterpretations of the law.
July 2024: FCA extend the timeline for concluding the s166 review to May 2025 and the associated complaint handling pause until December 2025. The FCA indicate their interest in the outcome of the test case appeals and the JR decision, it is noted that they consider a redress scheme is more likely than when they started their review.

What has Happened

The Court of Appeal Decision
The three cases stemming from regional courts (Hopcraft v Close Brothers Ltd, Johnson v Firstrand Bank Ltd, and Wrench v Firstrand Bank Ltd) were merged and heard by the Court of Appeal in July 20243
On 25 October 2024, the Court of Appeal set out its judgment:
The Court of Appeal decided it was unlawful for the brokers (who were also the car dealers) to receive a commission from the lender providing motor finance without obtaining the customer’s informed consent to the payment.
The Court inferred that informed consent required the consumer to be told in clear and prominent terms all material facts regarding the commission, including the amount of the commission and how it was to be calculated.
The judgment related to fixed commission in motor finance agreements as well as DCAs.
The decision therefore extends to any motor finance commission arrangement where informed consent was not provided by the customer.  
In one of the three cases the commission was deemed to have been kept secret (i.e. the commission was not disclosed to the customer at all), in the other two it was considered that there was partial disclosure (i.e. there was some disclosure in the customer documentation) but in these specific cases the disclosure wasn’t adequate.
Consumer Credit Act 1974
In one of the cases (Johnson) the Court of Appeal found that the relationship between the customer and the lender was also unfair based on the level of disclosure combined with the value of the commission in relation to the sum borrowed (in this instance the commission was 25% of the sum borrowed).
Appeals to the Supreme Court
Both firms immediately confirmed their intention to appeal the decisions to the Supreme Court.
The Supreme Court has granted permission to appeal the cases on 11th December 20244, confirming that the cases will be heard prior to the end of March 2025.
The FCA’s response
The FCA in response to the decisions has:
Engaged with industry, government and consumer representatives. 
Confirmed the common law position and the expectation that FCA authorised firms are required to follow both this and the FCA rules and regulations.
Been supportive of the referral to the Supreme Court and the expedition of the hearing.  The FCA have confirmed they are considering whether to formally intervene in the case to share their expertise to assist the Court on the substantive appeal.
Responded to market analyst questions in relation to expectations for firms to maintain appropriate financial resources.5
Intimated the potential read-across of the issue to other product and sectors by noting “ “there may also be wider implications for other financial services markets regulated by the FCA that involve intermediary arrangements.”6
Extension of the complaint handling pause for non DCA related commission complaints
The FCA signalled that the Court of Appeal decision is likely to result in a sharp and significant increase in motor finance non-DCA commission complaints, creating additional pressures on firms and the FOS.
In light of this expected increase in complaints, the FCA subsequently opened a consultation on extending the DCA related complaints handling pause to all commission related complaints (13th November 2024) , the consultation period was short concluding by 5th December.7
On 19th December 2024, the FCA issued Policy Statement PS24/18, confirming that they are extending the time firms have to respond to complaints about motor finance agreements not involving a DCA:8
Firms now have until after 4 December 2025 to provide a final response to non-DCA complaints received on or after 26th October 2024 (this is in line with the extension already provided for complaints involving DCAs). 
The pause incorporates an expanded definition of a motor finance non-DCA commission complaint to cover regulated motor finance consumer hire agreements, as well as regulated motor finance credit agreements.
The FCA is clear that firms will need to use the time provided so as to be ready to issue final responses to complaints at the end of a  extension, stating “that the rules do not remove the obligations on firms to progress complaints under the DISP rules. This includes continuing to investigate and collect evidence to help with the eventual resolution of these complaints, taking into account all relevant factors (including the Court of Appeal’s judgment)”.
Back to the DCA issue 
It’s important to remember that, in April 2024, Barclays launched proceedings for a Judicial Review over a FOS decision in January 2024, against them, basing the challenge on alleged misinterpretations of the law. This case’s hearing commenced on 15th October 2024. 
On 17 December 2024, the High Court found in favour of the FOS, the Court dismissed all 3 grounds of appeal brought by the lender, Barclays Partner Finance.9 Barclays immediately confirmed their intention to appeal the decision10. The FCA also issued a statement on the same day welcoming the clarity the judgement provided on important areas of law relevant to their review and noting their intention to set out the next steps for the DCA review in May 202511.

What this means for motor finance firms

Informed consent is currently a legal requirement
Firms are now required to adhere to this common law position.
As a result, immediately following these decisions, lenders were required to update their processes and controls to be compliant with the articulation of informed consent through the judgements.
For some firms, this led to the need to temporarily pause the payment of commission and/or the issue of new finance whilst these arrangements were put in place.
All firms were operating at pace and a period of embedding and refinement of the updated processes and controls will ensue.
Complaint volumes are likely to spike
As a result of the judgements, firms are likely to see a surge in complaint volumes relating to disclosure rather than the discretionary nature of the commission model.
In particular, the online template issued by Martin Lewis on the Money Savings Expert website has now been updated to cater for non DCA related complaints.
Following the release of this initial tool for DCA complaints, firms were reported to have received c1M complaints in the first month of this going live12.
Firms will need to be appropriately set up to manage the logging and appropriate acknowledgement of complaints throughout the pause period.
The FCA has been clear it expects firms to have taken preparatory steps to be ready to issue responses to the complaints once the pause is lifted.
There is a need to review and segment the back book
Regardless of the expedition of the Supreme Court Hearing, the current state of uncertainty will persist at least for Q1 of 2025.
As a priority, firms now need to understand any potential future liabilities based on the dynamics of the back book. This requires a review to identify the resemblance of the book to the specific Court of Appeal case fact patterns.
This review should take into account, for example:
The sophistication of the customer which appears to have been directly relevant to the appeal decisions.
The position in relation to fully secret versus partial disclosure, particularly where a firm may consider their controls and disclosures went beyond those of the Court of Appeal cases.
Other relevant factors such as how processes and controls may have changed over time, the customer journey, the tied nature of the broker, the relationship of the broker, and materiality of the commission amount.
Firms should then segment the back book accordingly supporting both financial and operational planning around a range of different scenarios (which will depend on the conclusions of the FCA’s review and Supreme Court hearing).
There are potential impacts on commission arrangements outside of motor finance
Whilst the fact patterns of these individual cases relate to motor finance, it is without doubt that commission arrangements more generally are an area of focus for the regulator.
For example, in August this year, the FCA announced its intention to conduct two Market Studies on pure protection and premium finance. A central tenet of both these market studies related to commission and commission disclosure.   
Firms should consider how their broader arrangements are resulting in good customer outcomes and whether they meet the existing expectations under the Consumer Duty – especially in relation to Price & Fair Value and Customer Understanding outcomes.  
The cases, at a minimum, emphasise the need for firms to be aware that where commission is being paid, this needs to be clear and transparent to the consumer.

How KPMG in the UK can help

We offer multi-disciplinary professional services that allow us to support our clients across the full range of activities required through our Consulting, Legal and Managed Service businesses.
Three key immediate priorities:
1. Scenario modelling
Our legal, regulatory and modelling SMEs can support with:
Detailed scenario planning based on different approaches and depending on varying assumptions including scope and redress.
Identification of distinguishing factors, understanding the dynamics of the back book and how disclosures may have varied and improved over time. 
Insights into variables, key metrics and assumptions by agreement type, dealer, time period relevant to any future reporting including, for example, adjustments for complaint rates, settlements and processing costs.
2. Complaint Handling Surge Support
In response to the expected sharp and significant increase in commission related non-DCA complaints, the FCA have now confirmed that firms have until after 4 December 2025 to provide a final response to these (if received on or after 26th October 2024). This is in line with the extension already provided for complaints involving DCAs. The extension expanded the definition of complaints to include motor leasing / consumer hire agreements.
Fuelled by media interest and the updated Martin Lewis complaint template, an impending surge of complaints and Data Subject Access Requests (DSARs) is now likely to follow.
KPMG can provide the following assistance:
Technology and Automation - tactical technology capabilities to automate complaint and DSAR logging and workflow (including automation of acknowledgements and updates).
Complaint handler resourcing - access to trained complaint handling personnel through our KPMG academy and managed service offerings. We offer trained ‘pod’ resourcing capacity both onshore, offshore and near shore to help manage short term spikes safely and efficiently.
3. Front book process and control review / validation
Changes to disclosure processes and controls to adapt to the new common law position have been progressed at pace. A period of refinement and embedding is now underway.
KPMG’s regulatory and legal subject matter experts can support with:
Review, outcome testing and validation of changes made
Assessing any broader commission arrangements outside of motor finance on a review and recommend basis
Looking to the future
Longer term planning is also required to ensure operational readiness to respond to the Supreme Court rulings and regulatory instruction.
Population analysis and data readiness
An effective response to the future Court and FCA verdicts will rely on accurate and complete data. Our data team can assist with:
Design of data enrichment strategies to enable greater automation in complaints handling / proactive redress.
Collating a robust, auditable and tested data source for all motor finance arrangements, including the commission arrangement, commission value, transactional history, and personal information where available.
Scaled complaints processing
The FCA have indicated that in relation to DCA commission a redress scheme is now more likely than when they started their review. Unless the outcome of the Supreme Court judgements is a significant overturn of the Court of Appeal rulings the current position will materially extend the scope of this exercise. Either way, 2026 is likely to bring the requirement for firms to scale up operational and technology capabilities for processing complaints. KPMG can support:
The design and development of strategic complaints management to enable a data led response at scale when the pause is lifted.
Design and implementation of appropriate technology and automation to support a digital-first complaints journey, redress calculator, customer portal.
Operational stand up and execution for mass customer engagement. Exception processes and controls.
Independent quality assurance partnering to validate the completeness and accuracy of the complaint processing.

Mergers and acquisitions activity is poised to pick up.

Global growth is expected to come in at a 3.1% pace in 2024, slightly lower than 2023, and below the pre-pandemic norm of 3.6% from 2000 to 2019. In 2025, we expect growth to accelerate to 3.2% before post-election policies in the US dampen global growth to 3.0% in 2026. The pace of inflation is forecast to continue cooling between now and mid-2025. The forecast thereafter depends heavily on the pace of tariffs and whether we see a full-blown trade war erupt.
Geopolitical risk remains elevated. With the outcome of the US election, inflationary trade and immigration policies are expected to slow the pace of credit easing. Bond yields have already moved up in response to fears of mounting federal debt and higher inflation. Any major shift in tariffs in the US could trigger retaliatory measures.
Most major central banks, except for the Bank of Japan, have initiated rate-cutting cycles. The US dollar initially weakened following the start of the Federal Reserve’s first rate cut in September. However, the US dollar reversed course and moved up on higher inflation expected post-election. Russia and Turkey, along with Eastern European nations, are expected to struggle with inflation for longer.
Global inflation has cooled in response to higher rates, slower growth, excess supply and a drop in energy prices. Service sector inflation is beginning to moderate as well. A lingering concern is outsized wage gains in Europe where productivity growth lags. There is a backlash forming to foreign tourism, as it is further propping up service sector inflation.
Delays in the effects of monetary policy will push the influence of rate cuts into the second half of 2025 and 2026. We could see a tailwind for big-ticket consumer purchases and business investment. Much is contingent upon headwinds due to retaliatory tariffs.
Mergers and acquisitions activity is poised to increase with lower rates and a record amount of dry powder in the private equity space. Policy uncertainty, anticorporate sentiment and protectionist policies could curb the largest and cross-border deals. Heightened levels of policy uncertainty tend to reduce the number of M&A transactions, increase the length of time to their completion and curb the premiums firms are willing to pay for deals.
Fiscal policy may be more stimulative. COVID-era appropriations have lapsed, but market participants are betting on a new wave of stimulus. The biggest gains in spending are expected to be in pensions, healthcare and defense. Tax cuts are expected to be extended in full in the US; what is unknown is how multinationals not located in the US will be treated.

https://kpmg.com/xx/en/our-insights/ifrg/2024/frut-hyperinflation-reporting-ifrs-ias29.html,,How should companies account for hyperinflationary economies?,,"Global Corporate Reporting Institute | IFRS Today | Uncertain times digital hub

(This article was first published on 21 June 2022 and updated on 4 December 2024)

What’s the issue?

Under IFRS® Accounting Standards, judgement is needed to determine when to apply hyperinflationary accounting.
Hyperinflationary accounting under IAS 29 Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies is relevant for the:
financial statements of companies reporting under the standards whose functional currencies are those of hyperinflationary economies; and
consolidated financial statements of groups reporting under the Standards with foreign operations (e.g. a subsidiary, associate or joint arrangement) whose functional currencies are those of hyperinflationary economies.

During times of economic uncertainty, many economies experience increased levels of inflation – and in some cases, hyperinflation. Companies with operations whose functional currency is that of a hyperinflationary economy should expect to apply IAS 29.

Getting into more detail

Indicators of hyperinflation
Hyperinflation is indicated by the characteristics of an economy, which include but are not limited to the following.
The general population prefers to keep its wealth in non-monetary assets or in a relatively stable foreign currency – amounts of local currency held are invested immediately to maintain purchasing power.
The general population regards monetary amounts not in terms of the local currency but in terms of a relatively stable foreign currency – prices may be quoted in the stable currency.
Sales and purchases on credit take place at prices that compensate for the expected loss of purchasing power during the credit period, even if the period is short.
Interest rates, wages and prices are linked to a price index.
The cumulative inflation rate over three years is approaching, or exceeds, 100 percent. [IAS 29.3]
Although the 100 percent numerical indicator is a key factor in identifying hyperinflation, it is not the only factor and should not be considered in isolation. Applying all of these factors could result in an economy being considered hyperinflationary when its three-year cumulative inflation rate is, for example, only 80 percent. IAS 29 is applied from the beginning of the reporting period in which the company identifies hyperinflation. [Insights 2.10.20.10–30]

Actions for management

Management need to keep track of all economies that are hyperinflationary and apply IAS 29 when necessary. Based on our assessment under IAS 29, we currently consider the following economies to be hyperinflationary.

https://kpmg.com/xx/en/our-insights/transformation/changing-landscape-of-family-governance.html,Transformation,Changing landscape of family governance,,"As the next generation of ASPAC family business leaders matures, the importance of a robust family governance structure only deepens. 
Even in the face of changing values and mores, the family remains a cornerstone of society and major contributor of economic growth. They make up 90% of global economic enterprises, and 27% of private capital markets globally, with assets under management of more than US$6 trillion.1
Though younger than their counterparts in other regions, Asia Pacific family businesses have grown in prominence in recent years, with over half of the top 1,000 companies commanding US$4.2 trillion in value in 2023.2 The immense achievements of these companies have resulted in the onset of a massive transfer of wealth in the region — by 2030, much as US$2.5 trillion expected to move from one generation to the next.3

Formalizing the family

Asia Pacific business families are not immune to the shifts in values and priorities that are occurring with the introduction of a new generation of leaders. Having come of age in a time of economic and geopolitical change, younger leaders bring with them unique perspectives informed by their digital nativity and strong sense of social responsibility.
While these future-forward perspectives could lay the foundation for growth for the business down the line, they also set the stage for potential conflict between not just generations but also family members such as siblings or cousins. As family businesses in Asia Pacific grow in size and complexity, there is growing consensus on the need for a robust family governance structure.
Broadly speaking, family governance is concerned with establishing clear boundaries within the business family that enable communication, decision-making and role assignation both inside and outside the family.
In our experience in working with many of these legacy families, discussions often lean towards the need for a conflict resolution policy. Implemented properly, a strong governance framework can act as a pre-emptive conflict mitigation strategy by ensuring individuals can fall back on the family’s shared values for guidance and stay focused on their collective goals to preserve and grow their legacy wealth.

Getting the structure right

Every family will have its own natural, if informal, approach to managing their interrelations. Utilizing a family governance structure, business families can effectively formalize those unofficial or unspoken but accepted norms by making the implicit explicit. In doing so, families foster clarity, transparency and organized accountability in the day-to-day running of a business, as well as its long-term strategic objectives.
What form that structure takes is entirely dependent on each family and their shared values. It may not even sit within the traditional tax or legal definition of a “family structure” but can often be the cornerstone that enables such structures to operate.
A business family could, for example, establish distinct entities for specific functions, such as a business board or family council. Each provides a platform for discussions to take place in the correct setting with the right individuals to address strategic and/or business imperatives. Family businesses can also consider setting up a shareholders’ council or an owners’ council, as the board, shareholders and family all have unique goals and tasks within a governance structure.

Nurturing a new generation of leaders

As these governance structures come into being, the issue of ownership over management is also coming into focus in ASPAC. Rather than being nurtured for executive roles, the next generation is transitioning into roles as educated and engaged owners, reflecting the evolving dynamics within family enterprises.
Several factors are at play. First, families are increasingly diversified in their holdings, encompassing various assets such as operating businesses, real estate portfolios, equities and investments, and personal assets like vacation homes or boats and planes. Consequently, the emphasis for the next generation is to effectively manage this diversified wealth, rather than solely focusing on leading one specific family business.
Moreover, the family tree naturally grows across generations, with more individuals becoming potential stakeholders in the family's interests. As the tree branches out, it becomes impractical for all members to directly participate in business operations. The pivot towards nurturing ownership skills therefore becomes crucial to ensure effective stewardship and engagement among the growing number of family members.
Demographic shifts are playing a role in this evolution, too. Unlike with previous generations, where career paths were often determined by parental or societal expectations, the younger generation today enjoys greater autonomy and choice. Parents, sometimes reflecting on their own experiences, are more inclined to support their children's aspirations, be it joining the family business, pursuing an alternate career or entrepreneurship.
This trend underscores a broader cultural shift seen across Asia towards prioritizing — or at least giving equal consideration — to personal fulfillment and autonomy alongside traditional familial obligations. Is the next generation empowered to shape their own destinies while contributing meaningfully to the family's collective prosperity? How will their prioritization on social change impact how they invest and make decisions that shape business strategy? How can greater governance ensure the preservation of their family’s wealth?

A discourse across time

While the next generation is driving many of these changes, senior members of families have an integral role in bringing these discussions to the table. They may also serve as essential sources of wisdom and experience for the next generation business leaders to learn from.
There is an ongoing tussle between honoring the past and embracing the future, one that may be especially heightened in Asia Pacific, where discussion about succession or generational change can still be taboo. Family businesses often find themselves caught between preserving their history and legacy and evolving their operations to remain relevant in the years to come.
An extreme approach on either side can lead to conflict or hinder success, which is why the most effective strategy may a middle way, where there is a period of overlap during intergenerational shifts. During this time, the wisdom and experience of the older generation can blend with the fresh ideas and perspectives of the young, a combination that has proven to be highly successful where operations are jointly run and responsibilities and decision-making are equally shared.
Realizing this depends on effective governance and reinforces the need for open and continued dialogue amongst the family. Do we have a clear and aligned definition of success?  What relationship do we want to have collectively and individually with the business or wider wealth? How will we know if we are on track?
Governance can be a tool to help business families focus on the future by learning from their past and history, setting them up for ongoing success.

https://kpmg.com/xx/en/our-insights/esg/top-10-insights-from-cop29.html,ESG,Top 10 takeaways from COP29,,"Overall takeaways from COP29

Despite not making as much progress as hoped for on the New Collective Quantified Goal on climate finance or on the phase out of fossil fuels, there are many reasons to be positive about COP29. It is very clear that non-state actors are moving in a constructive direction to address key challenges on the mitigation and adaptation agendas. Overall, there was more positivity than expected and a real sense of momentum across various fronts.
While COP29 was described as the “Finance COP” which it very much was, the other critical issue that dominated discussions was the requirement for signatories to the Paris Agreement to produce third generation Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and the need for greater levels of ambition by February 2025 (though it is likely most countries will delay past this date).
There was significant focus on aligning NDCs with local country corporate transition plans and developing investable NDCs, highlighting the intersection of the climate finance and climate policy agendas.

Cross-cutting themes for the Business Community

Value creation: There was broad acceptance that there needs to be an underlying value proposition if meaningful progress is going to be taken. This is important in the context of future policy developments in particular e.g. carbon taxes. Similarly, there was growing awareness that the transition to a low carbon economy presents an unprecedented economic opportunity.
Collaboration: Overall much greater sense of the need for increased collaboration across the agenda. This can be seen across many different areas including industrial decarbonization, climate finance for emerging markets, transition plans and linkages with Nationally Determined Contributions and Climate Action Plans and more.
Harmonization: There is an acknowledgement that due to the significant scale of varying national and international standards, and the increasing burden on organizations reporting against them, that harmonization across standards, and a focus on strategic action rather than just disclosure, is increasingly critical.
Resilience: Businesses recognize the importance of developing climate and decarbonization strategies that provide resilience against both transition and physical risks of climate, as well as potential future uncertainties.

Explore 10 key takeaways from COP29:

Other key topics at COP29

Avoided emissions has become a significant area of discussion across different sectors – in particular companies that are producing products and solutions which help to lower emissions for their customers wish to establish some methodology for recognizing the carbon benefits achieved. Also, recognition of avoided emissions can help crystalize greater volumes of transition finance. 
There was significant focus on greenwashing risk which has becomes an area of concern for corporates attempting to achieve net zero across their value chain by 2050.
The climate: health nexus has become an important part of the global climate agenda because of the impact that climate is having on global healthcare and also because of the emissions coming from the healthcare sector.
Nature & Biodiversity did not feature as heavily as expected at COP29, despite (and possibly because of) COP16 (the Biodiversity COP) taking place immediately ahead of it. The key themes at COP29 around e.g. finance, implementation of national plans and transition plans were also key discussions at COP16 (but from a nature viewpoint) with many key businesses pointing to the need for a more holistic approach to these two key issues, recognizing their critical linkages.

The road to COP30

The focus in the run up to COP30 in Belém, Brazil, will be on keeping 1.5C alive, and enhancing adaptation and resilience globally.
This focus in particular will be around the delivery of enhanced ambitions through the NDCs, tied to real economy commitments via National Transition Plans and Corporate Transition Plans. Leveraging finance in line with commitments made at COP29, as well as calling climate finance actors to work towards scaling up finance to at least $1.3 trillion to developing countries from all public and private sources – the “Baku to Belém Roadmap to 1.3T”, including through grants, concessional and non-debt instruments.
Brazil have also announced that nature will be one of the key themes on the agenda of the Brazilian Presidency and their invitation for countries to consider a joint work program across the biodiversity and climate conventions is an early signal to the importance they are putting to bringing a more integrated approach to these issues.

https://kpmg.com/xx/en/our-insights/operations/six-supply-chain-trends-to-watch-in-2025.html,Operations,Six supply chain trends to watch in 2025,,"After several years of building supply chain resilience and visibility, supply chain leaders must now deliver genuine value to the overall business. In 2025, achieving this broader impact will likely require leaders to get very granular about the supply chain’s cost-to-serve, to deeply understand the environmental and social practices of their suppliers, and to pragmatically assess how their technology is delivering on these needs.
In addition, supply chain leaders will need to look up and out, being aware of the uncertainty around geopolitical issues, how emerging technology could bring profoundly change, and how industry transformations will require new operational and workforce approaches. Here, we dive into six key trends for 2025 in more detail.

1. Cost-to-serve

In 2025, organizations should turn to the supply chain to help reduce costs to mitigate the impacts of inflation and global instability. However, with traditional margin improvement methods exhausted, supply chain leaders will need to assess cost-to-serve at a granular level. This will require understanding of the cost implications of different products, customers, and channels, the costs of each supply chain node and facility, and costs of each pathway and ship-to location. This clarity can enable the adoption of pricing strategies that reflect the true cost of service, highlight alternative product flows and ship-to strategies, and provide great insight to flex other supply chain costs to adapt to disruptions.
To support this deep understanding of costs, supply chain leaders will need to make the most of advanced analytics, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning (ML). They will need to embrace technology that facilitates monitoring, alerting, and predictive analysis, empowering them to adopt a near real-time and proactive approach.

2. Supply chain risk management

CEOs see the supply chain as a top 3 risk to business (according to the KPMG 2024 CEO Outlook survey). Therefore, in the year ahead, supply chain risk management will need dedication amid increasing geopolitical challenges, inflationary pressures, and ongoing supply chain disruptions. Leaders will need to focus on the risks of new sustainability and environmental regulations, and be ready for new trade and tariff policies. There will likely also be risks aligned to generative artificial intelligence (Gen AI) tools, for example, stricter privacy and data management requirements.
Changing consumer preferences will also present risk, such as demand for faster delivery, higher customization, and ethical sourcing. Further, labor shortage risks will need consideration, particularly in warehousing, transport, and manufacturing. Cybersecurity threats are expected to grow across all areas of business, with weak spots in the supply chain a key point of entry for threat actors.
To mitigate these risks, supply chain leaders will need to embrace new, predictive, and prescriptive technologies. It will likely be vital to leverage big data for insights, and to work collaboratively with ecosystem partners to share knowledge. Extended visibility deep into the supply chain will remain fundamental, with the need to map supply chains to Tier 4 and beyond. Supply chain leaders should use Digital Twin technology to enhance visualization of the full value chain and build control of their network footprint.

3. ESG/Scope 3

In recent years, environmental, social and governance (ESG) requirements put immense demands on supply chain leaders, as the supply chain is a key avenue to meet organizational ESG targets and Scope 3 expectations. This responsibility is set to continue in 2025, but with even more on the agenda.
To begin, supply chain leaders will need to ensure they have a comprehensive understanding of the entire value chain. Leaders will need to identify, capture, and validate data on partners for ESG awareness, risk mitigation, and reporting. There will likely be demand to improve the human rights and other social implications of the supply chain, while also navigating the complex landscape of ESG-related regulations, such as the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), and the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD).
In 2025, there will also be expectations that supply chain leaders will turn ESG and Scope 3 challenges into opportunities for stronger business performance, and to be a competitive differentiator. Further, they will need to create a more circular economy, exploring how products can be returned, recycled or re-invented, so that the business takes more responsibility for the entire product lifecycle.

4. Generative AI

With AI, blockchain, and the Internet of Things (IoT) now integral to the supply chain, and Virtual Reality (VR) and Digital Twins increasing in prominence, leaders will need to keep leveraging these capabilities while looking at what’s on the tech horizon.
Front and center is Gen AI, presenting immense potential to take the supply chain to the next level during 2025. Gen AI’s ability to draw on vast data sets, rapidly create content, and to self-learn could streamline tasks in procurement, category management, strategic sourcing, contract lifecycle management, supplier risk and relationship management, and requisition-to-receive and invoice-to-pay processes. While much of this has been in the experimental phase, in 2025, supply chain leaders may start to gain genuine value from their Gen AI investments.

5. Intake and orchestration technologies

When it comes to procurement technology, leaders will likely come across new intake and orchestration (I&O) tech tools in 2025. Intake tools sit in front of existing applications, providing a simple way of capturing essential data, while orchestration tools sit above existing applications, enabling process workflow across multiple solutions.
Large enterprise software solutions are being challenged by these new tools, as they offer more flexibility, shorter implementation times, and simpler user experiences. Many organizations are looking at what is possible with I&O tools before replacing legacy procurement technologies.
It is likely that in response to these new tools, the largest Source-to-Pay platforms will release their own I&O functionality by mid-2025. It’s also likely that new partnerships will form between these large platforms and boutique I&O solutions.

6. Industry transformation

Industry transformation has been in motion for some time, driven by the energy transition agenda, advanced technology and robotics, and rapid product innovations for some. This environment has led to the need for large scale operational change, requiring new skills, and changing workforce needs.
In 2025, industry transformation will likely require supply chain and procurement personnel to adapt even more to new technologies and be ready to upskill and reskill. Facilitating new responsibilities for supply chain roles, such as transport and logistics managers, category managers, spend analysts, and data and AI modelers, will likely become increasingly important for success.
With more organizations embracing hybrid working models for their employees, many are considering opening Global Capability Centers (GCCs) or Centers of Excellence (CoEs) to deliver supply chain and procurement functions efficiently. In 2025, this decentralized approach could help leverage global talent pools and foster innovation and productivity.

Getting ready

As supply chain leaders head into 2025, these six trends are expected to be driving agendas and will likely require new ways of thinking, planning, and collaboration. Across cost, risk, technology, ESG requirements, and operations, there will be little time to waste. If you would like support in your supply chain strategy and transformation in 2025, KPMG professionals are here to help.

KPMG International forecasts GDP growth picking up from 3.1% in 2024 to 3.2% in 2025
Inflation forecast to cool from 4.5% in 2024 to 3.5% in 2025
Geopolitical risks remain elevated with post-US election policies, including possible tariffs, potentially hitting growth and inflation in 2026

KPMG Global Economic Outlook – December 2024

KPMG International is forecasting global growth will rise slightly in 2025 to 3.2 percent before post-election policies in the US dampen global GDP to 3.0 percent in 2026.
The latest expectations in the December 2024 KPMG Global Economic Outlook highlight the continued geopolitical and economic uncertainty slowing down the impact of recent central bank efforts to return the world to a path of sustainable growth.
KPMG forecasts the pace of inflation will continue cooling between now and mid-2025. Thereafter, the forecast depends heavily on the pace of tariffs and whether we see a full-blown trade war erupt.
Geopolitical risk remains elevated. Following the outcome of the US election, inflationary trade and immigration policies are expected to slow the pace of credit easing. Bond yields have already moved up in response to fears of mounting federal debt and higher inflation. Any major shift in tariffs in the US could trigger retaliatory measures.
Global inflation has cooled in response to higher rates, slower growth, excess supply and a drop in energy prices. Service sector inflation is beginning to moderate as well. A lingering concern is outsized wage gains in Europe where productivity growth lags. There is a backlash forming towards foreign tourism, as it is further propping up service sector inflation.
Delays in the effects of monetary policy will push the influence of rate cuts into the second half of 2025 and 2026. We could see a tailwind for big-ticket consumer purchases and business investment. Much is contingent on headwinds due to retaliatory tariffs.

Mergers and acquisitions activity is poised to increase with lower rates and a record amount of excess capital in the private equity space. Policy uncertainty, anti-corporate sentiment and protectionist policies could curb the largest cross-border deals. Heightened levels of policy uncertainty tend to reduce the number of M&A transactions, prolong their completion time and curb the premiums firms are willing to pay for deals. 
Fiscal policy may be more stimulative. COVID-era appropriations have lapsed, but market participants are betting on a new wave of stimulus. The biggest gains in spending are expected to be in pensions, healthcare and defense. Tax cuts are expected to be extended in full in the US; what is unknown is how multinationals not located in the US will be treated.

Over the last few months I have been connecting with leaders across KPMG to discuss the vital supporting role to be played by the audit profession to ensure that businesses report on their carbon footprints and sustainability agendas in a consistent manner, so that assurance on this information can be reliably provided by independent parties. The current COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the key importance of transparent reporting of the risks facing entities in this environment, including the resilience of their business models and global supply and value chains, and the interconnected role that financial and non-financial information play in achieving that goal.
We know that better connectivity between non-financial reporting and financial reporting, and the need for an integrated global corporate reporting structure, is a complex issue – and one that won’t be solved easily given the various affected parties and diverse perspectives of impacted stakeholders. Yet it is critical that we bring together these various perspectives and considerations in order to arrive at a consensus on a way forward and also, to ensure that further corporate reporting developments do not simply add to the multitude of existing frameworks.
I believe that the ultimate goal should be for a global standard for corporate reporting that considers the interconnectivity between non-financial information and financial reporting based on a conceptual framework for connected reporting. I outlined KPMG’s views recently in a response to an Accountancy Europe paper
opens in a new tab
 on these issues, which you can read in this document
opens in a new tab
 (PDF 53 KB). In my response I outline what I believe is required for a solution to interconnected standard setting for corporate reporting, including:
Global standard-setting solutions should better promote global investment flows

A global standard for corporate reporting is critical and will benefit both preparers and users of financial and non-financial information. Regional initiatives in corporate reporting may be necessary to achieve regional priorities, but they should not result in a fragmented global corporate reporting system. A global solution will assist in improving the efficiency and effectiveness of global capital flows, as well as result in a single framework to facilitate a single global approach to assurance, which will be critical for organizations that operate across national and regional borders; And importantly, for the benefit of investors.

Non-financial standard-setting needs a conceptual framework resulting in relevant information that meets stakeholder needs

For interconnected corporate reporting to be effective, it must address the right topics and provide the right information on those topics. This is evidenced, for example, by the fact that requests from investors for more information on ESG factors illustrate that their needs are not currently being met. This is also the case regarding investor calls for more information regarding intangible factors such as innovation, intellectual property, technology, brand and reputation, customer satisfaction, and the quality of strategic management and governance.

Global standard-setting solutions requires support by global bodies

In order to effect the systems change, global support is critical. At KPMG we encourage the engagement and support of the relevant global bodies such the Financial Stability Board, IOSCO, IMF, UN and World Bank, who have the stature and ability to ensure that a global solution is found.
I am interested to see how interconnected standard setting for corporate reporting initiatives continue to evolve, but we need to move forward on this issue. Now is the time for decisive action and in today’s climate with the COVID-19 pandemic, it is critical that we drive global consistency for businesses, investors and the public. This is an important debate that I feel passionate about. We all need to be part of building a solution so please get in touch to share your views.

November 2024 is the tenth anniversary of European banking supervision. Set up in response to the global financial crisis and subsequent Eurozone sovereign crisis, the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) is a key pillar of the EU Banking Union. At the centre of the SSM, the European Central Bank (ECB) began direct supervision of the largest and most complex European banks – known as ‘Significant Institutions' – in November 2014.
To mark the anniversary, KPMG and the Association of German Banks
opens in a new tab
(Bundesverband deutscher Banken, BdB) have published a joint paper assessing the SSM’s record and offering recommendations for the future. The paper is informed by the results of a survey of ECB-supervised banks conducted by KPMG, the BdB and the Centre for Financial Studies at the Goethe University, Frankfurt
opens in a new tab
(CFS).
The joint paper acknowledges that the SSM has had real and significant success in its first decade. Since 2014 the SSM has improved the quality of banking supervision in Europe, and has overseen a major strengthening of European bank balance sheets. This success has, however, come at a significant price: compliance costs for European banks have increased substantially. Many banks regard these costs as excessive and believe they create a competitive disadvantage for European banks.
EU leaders have made promoting growth their top policy priority. In this context, the joint KPMG / BdB paper makes three recommendations for the SSM as it enter its second decade:
The SSM should adopt a formal growth objective alongside its goal of protecting financial stability
The SSM should commit to more proportionate supervision reflecting the differences between banks’ business models and risk profiles
The SSM should improve communication with banks on its supervisory assessments and expectations.
Adopting these recommendations will allow the SSM to build on its successes so far, and continue to maintain financial stability while supporting European banks’ ongoing viability and ability to finance investment and innovation. In this way the SSM can make a significant contribution to promoting European growth and prosperity.
Please do reach out to our KPMG contacts if you would like more information on the survey results.

Investors need to be able to connect the information in the financial statements – e.g. about the assumptions used in calculating the recoverable amount – with the information a company provides outside the financial statements (e.g. in the front part of the annual report).
To tell a connected story, companies need to provide a coherent, connected and integrated picture across their financial statements, management discussion and analysis (MD&A) and sustainability-related disclosures, regardless of the frameworks or standards used outside the financial statements.   
New standards for sustainability reporting – including European Sustainability Reporting Standards and IFRS® Sustainability Disclosure Standards – mean that the focus on this topic is increasing rapidly.

Although the data and assumptions used to disclose information in the front part of the annual report (e.g. in the MD&A, management commentary and sustainability reports) may differ from those used in the financial statements (see Question 2), they need to be consistent where appropriate.
If inconsistencies exist, then disclosing the significant differences in assumptions and the reasons for them may be necessary to help stakeholders understand and reconcile the information in the front part of the report to the financial statements. In addition, some sustainability reporting frameworks may require disclosing this information as part of the sustainability report.

Clear, transparent and connected disclosures about the impact of climate-related matters on impairment testing are key to meeting the expectations of users of the financial statements. In evaluating whether disclosures on climate-related matters are appropriate, a company considers the relevance of the information to the users of its financial statements. For impairment, users want to understand whether and how climate-related matters are reflected in the calculation of the recoverable amount.
IFRS® Accounting Standards do not refer explicitly to climate-related matters, but they implicitly require relevant disclosures in the financial statements when climate-related matters that have been considered in preparing the financial statements are material. Therefore, companies need to consider materiality carefully when deciding what information to provide.
To meet users’ expectations, companies need to consider the specific disclosure requirements in individual standards (e.g. IAS 36 Impairment of Assets) as well as the relevant disclosure requirements in IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements.

Companies typically use the discounted cash flow (DCF) technique to calculate the recoverable amount. The rate applied to discount the cash flows is based on a market participant's view of the asset (or cash-generating unit (CGU)) – for both value in use (VIU) and fair value less costs of disposal (FVLCD).
[IAS 36.55–56, A16, IFRS 13.B14(a)]
In our experience, the most common approach to estimating an appropriate discount rate is to use the weighted-average cost of capital (WACC) formula. One of the components of the WACC is the cost of equity, which is typically calculated using the capital asset pricing model (CAPM). Climate-related matters may affect two inputs that are used to calculate the cost of equity using the CAPM – the alpha and the beta factors. [IAS 36.A17(a), Insights 3.10.300.30].

For a more detailed discussion on how to reflect the impact of climate-related matters on the discount rate, see our article What’s the impact on the discount rate used in testing non-current assets for impairment?

Companies typically use the discounted cash flow (DCF) technique to calculate the recoverable amounts of assets (or cash-generating units (CGUs)).
Climate-related risks and opportunities may significantly affect expectations of a company’s future cash flows in many ways – its revenues, operating costs (opex) and capital expenditure (capex).

Companies commonly use a five-year forecast period when calculating the recoverable amount. If a company has an asset (or cash-generating unit (CGU)) with a useful life that extends beyond the forecast period, then the company needs to calculate a terminal value for the asset (or CGU).
The terminal value reflects the present value of the cash flows to be generated by an asset (or CGU) from the end of the forecast period until the end of the asset’s (or CGU’s) life, or to perpetuity if it does not have a limited useful life.

For many companies, the major impacts of climate-related matters are expected in the long term – far beyond the five-year forecast period that is typically used in practice for valuations of businesses. In such cases, it is the terminal value that is expected to be most affected by climate-related matters. If climate-related matters are expected to have a significant impact on the business, then the forecast period may need to be extended to reach a steady state (see Question 2).

IAS 36 Impairment of Assets requires a company to assess at each reporting date whether there is any indication that an asset or cash-generating unit (CGU) may be impaired1. The accounting standard also contains a non-exhaustive list of internal, external and other indicators of impairment. [IAS 36.9, 12–13] 
Although climate-related factors, such as those in the diagram below, are not mentioned explicitly in IAS 36, they could lead to one or more of the internal or external indicators of impairment listed in the accounting standard.

Climate-related impairment indicators can be present in companies across all sectors or industries – they are not confined to a specific sector or industry.

1 Irrespective of any indicator of impairment, IAS 36 requires goodwill, intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and intangible assets not yet available for use to be tested for impairment at least annually.

https://kpmg.com/xx/en/our-insights/regulatory-insights/final-rules-on-uk-critical-third-parties.html,Regulatory Insights,Final rules on UK critical third parties,,"November 2024
On 12 November, the BoE, PRA and FCA jointly published a package of measures to establish an oversight regime for critical third parties (CTPs) to the financial sector. The package includes policy and supervisory statements on the identification of potential CTPs, recommendation for designation by HM Treasury (HMT), CTP fundamental rules, operational risk and resilience requirements, incident reporting, the regulators’ oversight regime and enforcement. A separate supervisory statement, BoE/PRA SS7/24, addresses reports by skilled persons on CTPs.

Background

The financial sector increasingly relies on services provided by third parties, allowing it to embrace innovation and improve efficiency. However, large parts of the sector rely on a small number of third parties for key services. The impact of disruption to these services could spread through the financial system and threaten financial stability, market integrity, or trigger a loss in confidence. 
Parliament has already legislated to allow HM Treasury (HMT) to designate third parties as critical and bring them within the UK regulators’ remit. HMT will be able to designate any third party providing existing and emerging technology and non-technology services to the financial sector as a CTP, where disruption to those services could pose systemic risk.
The UK regulators have designed the CTP oversight regime to be “compatible with similar approaches in other jurisdictions” and have committed to continuing to engage internationally to strengthen cross-border cooperation.

Identification and designation of CTPs

Draft criteria for identifying potential CTPs have been published previously and are confirmed in the final policy 
opens in a new tab
and supervisory 
opens in a new tab
statements published today alongside the overarching Approach to the oversight of critical third parties
opens in a new tab
. The regulators will assess third parties against three main criteria before recommending designation to HMT:
Concentration in the services which the third party provides to firms – this will be considered in absolute terms, i.e. the number of firms using the third party, and also whether any of the firms receiving services are systemically important.
Materiality of the services which the third party provides to firms – this will consider whether there are any channels through which a third party’s services to firms could create, amplify or spread risks to the financial system via the financial services being supported (“systemic third-party services”). Macro-vulnerabilities which may be relevant to regulators’ assessments of materiality include, but are not limited to, interconnectedness and speed of transmission.
Other drivers of potential systemic impact – for example availability or absence of substitutes or contingencies for third party services, or third-party access to firms’ assets as a result of services provided.
To note: third parties already subject to authorisation, regulation or supervision by the BoE, PRA or FCA will not be further designated as CTPs.
The regulators plan to consult on a new policy for Outsourcing and Third Party (OATP) data collection as one of the sources of data to identify potential CTPs. This data will feed into the proposed OATP register.
If HMT decides to designate a third party as a CTP, it will write to the prospective CTP to communicate its decision prior to publishing the Designation Regulations. The prospective CTP will be informed of the services which the regulators and HMT consider to be systemic. The regulators will then periodically review whether the CTP still meets the criteria and update HMT. CTP designation can only be removed by HMT.

CTP Fundamental Rules

In CP26/23, the regulators proposed 6 Fundamental Rules with which CTPs would be required to comply in respect of all the services provided to firms. In the final policy, the regulators have decided to apply Fundamental Rules 1 to 5 only in relation to the provision of systemic third-party services to firms, as this represents a more proportionate approach. Fundamental Rule 6 (‘A CTP must deal with each regulator in an open and cooperative way and must disclose to each regulator appropriately anything relating to the CTP of which it would reasonably expect notice’) will continue to apply to all services provided to firms.
The regulators rejected proposals for additional Fundamental Rules and have amended SS6/24 to note that CTPs should comply with the requirements ""in an open and cooperative way, and in line with the spirit as well as the letter of the relevant rules"", adopting a ""transparency by default"" approach.

Recap on the CTP Fundamental Rules

The regulators’ six Fundamental Rules will apply to all the services CTPs provide to UK firms and FMIs, and act as a general statement of their obligations under the proposed regime. These are broadly similar to the Fundamental Rules applied to regulated firms:
CTP Fundamental Rule 1: A CTP must conduct its business with integrity
CTP Fundamental Rule 2: A CTP must conduct its business with due skill, care and diligence
CTP Fundamental Rule 3: A CTP must act in a prudent manner
CTP Fundamental Rule 4: A CTP must have effective risk strategies and risk management systems
CTP Fundamental Rule 5: A CTP must organise and control its affairs responsibly and effectively
CTP Fundamental Rule 6: A CTP must deal with the regulators in an open and co-operative way, and disclose to the regulators appropriately anything relating to the CTP of which they would reasonably expect notice

CTP Operational Risk and Resilience Requirements

In CP26/23, the regulators also proposed eight Operational Risk and Resilience Requirements with which CTPs would be required to comply in respect of their systemic third party services. The regulators have decided to retain all the CTP Operational Risk and Resilience Requirements, but have made some minor revisions and clarifications, to support effectiveness and proportionality.
Incident reporting and other notifications

In CP26/23, the regulators proposed to require CTPs to notify them, and their firm and FMI customers who receive an affected service of certain incidents and other events. In the final rules:
The regulators distinguish between incident reports and other notifications.
The definition of an operational incident has been redrafted to encompass an event or series of events that ‘impacts a CTP’s operations such that the availability, authenticity, integrity or confidentiality of assets belonging to firms which a CTP has access to as a result of it providing a systemic third party service to those firms is or may be seriously and adversely impacted’.
The term ""affected firm"" has been introduced, meaning, (i) any firm to which a CTP supplies a systemic third party service impacted by that CTP operational incident; or (ii) any firm whose assets are or may be seriously and adversely impacted by that CTP operational incident.
Under CTP Fundamental Rule 6, the regulators reasonably expect to be made aware of incidents that have not yet had an impact on a CTP’s provision of systemic third party services or operations, but are highly likely to do so.
CTPs should report aggregate incidents and near-misses in their self-assessment. The regulators may also request these data on an ad-hoc basis.
Firms will still be expected to submit phased, i.e. initial, intermediate and final incident notifications. Initial notification requirements are updated to be ""as soon as practicable"" after the occurrence of a CTP operational incident. Intermediate notifications should be submitted ""as soon as practicable"" after any significant change in the circumstances described in the initial notification. Final notifications will be expected no later than 30 days following the resolution of a CTP operational incident.

Oversight

Annual self-assessment: CTPs will be required to carry out annual self-assessments setting out how they have complied with the regulators’ rules and expectations. These will provide an indication of the CTPs’ risk management and resilience capabilities and will include an assessment of the CTP’s approach to testing and assurance. In the first year of designation/oversight a CTP will also carry out an interim self-assessment to assist the regulators in understanding the extent to which it is able to meet its duties at the point of designation.
Annual Review meeting: the typical CTP oversight assessment period will be 12 months and will involve an Annual Review meeting during which the regulators will:
- Discuss the key risks a CTP poses to the regime’s Overall Objective based on developments over the preceding 12 month cycle, including oversight activities, any CTP operational incidents, recent or planned major change initiatives and engagement with other authorities.
- Agree the oversight strategy for the next 12 months, including planned oversight activities and actions the CTP will be requested to take, such as specific testing or remediation.
Actions from Annual Review: following the Annual Review, the regulators will write to the CTP clearly outlining the risks that are of greatest concern and where it is expected that the CTP takes risk management, risk mitigation or remediation actions.
Additional reviews: the regulators will take a risk-based approach to the assessment of CTPs. This will include fundamental assessment activities to form a view of risks, such as review of a CTP’s self-assessment and testing outputs, analysis of regular and ad-hoc data and information, meetings with CTP staff and engagement with other authorities. The regulators may also carry out further assurance via deep dive examinations, thematic reviews, skilled person reports or other relevant assurance, exercising or testing activities.

Source: BoE, PRA and FCA “The regulators’ approach to the oversight of critical third parties”

Engagement: the regulators expect CTPs to interact in an open and co-operative manner, as noted in Fundamental Rule 6. They caution that CTPs should not approach their engagement as a negotiation. The regulators will typically engage with a CTP via an appointed employee/s or member/s of its governing body. However, if appropriate, the regulators may also engage with other CTP employees or members of its governing body, including specialists in specific areas.
Intensity and format of oversight – the oversight regime is intended to be proportionate, reasonable and robust. Intensity may vary across CTPs, reflecting the regulators’ judgement of the potential impact of disruption in a CTP’s systemic third-party services on the financial system and on the advancement of their objectives.
Coordination: the PRA, BoE and FCA will share responsibility for the oversight regime, through a shared common Overall Objective and the statutory duty to coordinate the exercise of their respective CTP functions under FSMA section 312U and consult with each other. The regime will be coordinated through a joint CTP Consultation and Coordination Forum (CCF) as well as common memberships of the FCA Board, PRA Prudential Regulation Committee (PRC) and the BoE’s Financial Market Infrastructure Committee. Coordinated oversight activities will include:
Reviews of self-assessments (interim and annual) and any supporting documentation provided by the CTP (certifications, standards etc)
Regular and ad-hoc meetings with the CTP
Deep dive and thematic reviews (including skilled person reports)
Use of powers, including information gathering and referrals to enforcement
Participation in incident management playbook exercises (including any feedback provided to the CTP after the exercise)
Consideration of incident reports and follow-up actions
Engagement with other UK authorities and non-UK financial regulators

Enforcement: the FCA confirms that it will take a proportionate approach to enforcement, considering all relevant factors before taking any enforcement action. However, it is not possible to prescribe the exact circumstances in which the FCA would use any given power. The regulators have agreed a new tripartite memorandum of understanding on how they will approach CTP oversight and enforcement. To note, FSMA does not give the regulators the power to impose fines on CTPs. This was proposed under the Financial Services and Markets Bill in DP3/22 but has not been consulted on and is not part of the policy statement.

Implications for firms

The final rules for CTPs will take effect from 1 January 2025. However, the statutory obligations of a CTP under FSMA, the requirements in the regulators’ rules and the expectations in the SS6/24 and other documents listed in this PS, will only apply to a CTP on the date the HMT designation order comes into force. Compliance with certain requirements in the regulators’ rules will be subject to a transitional period that will also start from the date specified by HMT in the designation order - see Chapter 2 of PS16/24 and Section 12 of SS6/24 for a list of the requirements that are subject to a transitional period and the applicable transitional periods.
Although CTPs now have their own regulatory regime, firms using their services must continue to meet their own requirements under the regulators' third-party risk management policies. The new regulatory regime for CTPs does not change the need for financial services firms to conduct due diligence and perform ongoing monitoring of third parties with which they engage, whether these are CTPs or not. The regulators stress that contracting with a CTP will not relieve a firm from liability in any potential enforcement action.

Key Highlights
 Automation and AI are being embraced across industries. Many departments within a typical entity have integrated automation and AI tools into their operations or are exploring doing so. Finance departments are no exception. These tools not only can meaningfully increase productivity but also can help entities stay ahead in today’s rapidly evolving business landscape.
Yet, these tools come with added, but manageable, operational and regulatory risks. New or existing rules and regulations may also require disclosures about how an entity uses this technology, the risks related to its use, and the role the Board of Directors plays in its oversight. Responsible use and strong governance of automation and AI tools promotes confidence of investors and other relevant stakeholders in the capital markets. Those tasked with corporate governance over the financial reporting process need a game plan for identifying the automation and AI tools already being used in that process, evaluating the ones being considered, identifying the accompanying risks, and responding to those risks by establishing strong governance and control policies and procedures over the tools’ development, acquisition, deployment and operation. Management, with board oversight, plays a key role in establishing the right control environment for using these tools.
This publication is designed to assist you in developing and implementing such a game plan for automation and AI tools used in the financial reporting process. It explains key considerations for identifying and understanding the risks and walks through the process of developing strong governance policies and procedures to respond to those risks.

To promote the consistent application of financial reporting and the newly effective sustainability reporting requirements, the European securities regulator, ESMA1, has issued its priorities for 2024 annual reports. 
This year, as companies prepare their first set of sustainability reports under the newly effective European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS), the focus is shifting. A number of financial reporting areas aimed at driving clarity on presentation and disclosures remain on the watch list; however, sustainability reporting is the main focus. Regulators around the world will be watching how companies report under ESRS, with many more jurisdictions having made arrangements or pledges to implement sustainability reporting requirements in the coming years.
ESMA also highlights the need for consistency in the annual report and the importance of similar governance over both sustainability reporting and financial reporting.

Financial reporting – Driving clarity on presentation and disclosures

ESMA’s 2024 enforcement priorities highlight the following topics relating to IFRS® Accounting Standards.
ESMA’s area of focus ESMA’s priorities 
Newly effective requirements in 2024
Supplier finance arrangements: new disclosure requirements under IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows for supplier finance arrangements and their impact on the issuers’ exposure to liquidity risk. For further details, see our article. 
Classification of loans with covenants: revised guidance on the classification of loans with covenants as current vs non-current, and the new disclosure requirements under IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements and IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures about loans payable, in particular if there were defaults, breaches or renegotiations of loan agreements. For further details, see our article. 
Statement of cash flows
Gross basis: cash flows in the statement of cash flows need to be presented on a gross basis.  
Non-cash transactions: these cannot be presented in the statement of cash flows. Material non-cash transactions related to investing and financing transactions need to be disclosed elsewhere in the financial statements. 
Bank borrowings: generally classified as financing activities, except for some bank overdrafts. 
Clarity on accounting policies and judgements: the financial statements need to be clear on the accounting policies and judgements made regarding the classification of cash flows and/or components of cash and cash equivalents. 
Accounting policies, judgements, significant estimates
ESMA emphasises that disclosures of material accounting policies, judgements and sources of estimation uncertainty need to be company-specific and consistent with other information within the financial statements.  
The following areas are included in ESMA’s key highlights. 
Control, joint control and significant influence: determining control or significant influence over an investee may require significant judgement, particularly when factors other than the voting rights need to be considered. Clear and detailed disclosures under
IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interest in Other Entities about the significant judgements made when assessing control, joint control and significant influence are important. 
Revenue from contracts with customers: clarity on: 
judgements on whether a long-term contract meets the definition of a contract with a customer, and whether the issuer acts as principal or as an agent – e.g. when operating online shopping platforms or providing services such as software licences; 
uncertainties about the amount and timing of the outflows of economic benefits and the major assumptions in relation to future events; and 
backlogs and forecasts used when measuring the progress towards complete satisfaction of a performance obligation.

Sustainability reporting – Facing new challenges

As the first year of mandatory reporting under the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) arrives for the largest companies, ESMA’s enforcement priorities complement and build on their earlier statement on the focus areas for first-time reporting under ESRS.
ESMA’s area of focus ESMA’s priorities 
Materiality assessment                        
A thorough materiality assessment is required to determine relevant disclosures under ESRS. ESMA highlights the importance of:
using EFRAG2 implementation guidance and, where possible, quantitative information for their assessment; 
being transparent about the process followed when completing the materiality assessment, including: 
whether and how there was engagement with stakeholders; and  
how the assessment connects with due diligence performed on the impacts on affected stakeholders; and 
ensuring that company-specific disclosures provide sufficient relevant information to meet the needs of users. ESMA highlights that companies should only include these disclosures when they are material and meet the qualitative characteristics of information.
Structure and scope 
The reporting entity for the sustainability statement is generally the same as the financial statements, inclusive of value-chain considerations if required. ESMA highlights that companies should confirm that the same companies are included, and that data for the whole group should be included when a metric is material at group level. 
ESMA encourages companies to apply the detailed structure for the sustainability statement included in ESRS 1 General requirements, which may be a change for companies (and be particularly relevant for companies adopting multiple frameworks together). It highlights that cross-referencing and incorporation by referencing is permitted; however, companies need to make sure that they continue to meet the general presentation requirements. 
ESMA highlights that the transitional reliefs apply for value chain information in the first three years, with an expectation of a gradual enhancement in disclosures provided.  
EU Taxonomy Regulation           
ESMA reminds companies to use the templates prescribed by the taxonomy without modifications. 
Activities are sometimes eligible under multiple environmental objectives. In this situation, ESMA highlights that companies need to assess and report on eligibility under all applicable objectives, highlighting the primary objective in bold in the template. 
ESMA reminds companies to align disclosures in the financial statements with corresponding elements in the taxonomy disclosures.

Priorities related to ESEF reporting

On the requirements of digital reporting under the European Single Electronic Format (ESEF) regulation, ESMA highlights the following priorities. 
Accuracy and consistency: ESMA highlights common errors in tagging for ESEF and stresses the importance of using the appropriate taxonomy elements. There is an emphasis on correct scaling, consistency of calculations and completeness in tagging line items in the balance sheet. 
Mark-up quality: ESMA notes the improvement in text block readability. Issuers are advised to adhere closely to the guidance in the ESEF Reporting Manual.

Other ESMA communications

In addition to the enforcement priorities for 2024 annual reports, ESMA has issued: 
a statement
opens in a new tab
on accounting for carbon allowances in the financial statements; and 
a report
opens in a new tab
on first-time application of IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts.  
ESMA also reminds companies about enforcement priorities from 2023 that remain relevant, such as the need for connectivity between financial and sustainability statements in relation to climate-related risks and opportunities, the application of IFRS 17 and considerations on alternative performance measures (APMs).

This is a regular publication from KPMG's EMA Financial Services Regulatory Insight Centre, providing key updates on the latest ESG regulatory developments impacting financial services firms in the UK and the EU.
This last edition of ESG Regulatory Essentials for 2024 rounds up the latest updates and looks ahead to what the FS sector can expect before the end of the year and into 2025. 
The UK Chancellor of the Exchequer has just delivered her first Mansion House speech, outlining steps to make the UK `a global leader in sustainable finance'  - for more on the government's plans, see the article below. 
Across the UK and the EU, focus on the financial risks of climate change has intensified. EIOPA's recommendations for capital charges for assets held in the fossil fuel sector could have significant implications for both insurers and the wider sector. The European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs) have also published the results of their `Fit-for-55' scenario analysis. The PRA has shared thematic feedback on capturing climate risk in banks' expected credit losses and has asked auditors to monitor progress on areas of concern. Meanwhile, the latest macro-financial scenarios from the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) reflect the most recent scientific data and the UK Climate Financial Risk Forum (CFRF) has published a new set of guides on nature, short-term scenarios and adaptation finance. 
The Financial Stability Board (FSB) has issued a report on achieving consistent and comparable climate-related disclosures, highlighting areas of further work. The FCA has granted temporary flexibility for fund managers on its SDR naming and marketing rules under certain circumstances and has also provided examples of good and poor practice on SDR pre-contractual disclosures. In the EU, ESMA's fund name guidelines now apply to new funds, and the ESAs have published their latest annual report on SFDR principle adverse impacts disclosures. 
Market developments continue. IOSCO and ESMA have both published reports on the functioning of carbon markets, and a new set of integrity principles for voluntary carbon and nature markets was launched by the UK government at COP29, with a consultation to follow. The UK government is also consulting on the merits of a UK Green Taxonomy and has published a consultation response and draft legislation to bring ESG ratings providers into regulation. EU rules for ESG ratings providers are in the final stages of ratification. The Financial Reporting Council (FRC) has proposed revisions to the UK Stewardship Code to reframe expectations around sustainability. 
Before the end of 2024, we expect draft guidelines from the EBA on the management of ESG risks under the Capital Requirements Directive mandate and the first of two reports on the prudential treatment of environmental and social exposures under the Capital Requirements Regulation. In the UK, an FCA policy statement on non-financial misconduct, linked to last year's diversity and inclusion proposals, is due imminently. Looking ahead to the new year, there will be consultations in the UK on streamlined sustainability disclosures for economically significant companies and transition plan mandates. The eagerly awaited consultation on updates to PRA SS3/19 (Enhancing banks' and insurers' approaches to managing the financial risks from climate change) is due in Q1 and the UK regulators' policy statement on diversity and inclusion in the financial sector is expected in the first half of the year.

Regulatory workplans  
Joint Committee of the ESAs 2025 workplan 
The Joint Committee of the ESAs (the EBA, EIOPA and ESMA) has published its 2025 co-ordinated workplan
opens in a new tab
to ensure consistency of practices. Key areas of focus for 2025 include: 
Contributing guidance on sustainability disclosures and principal adverse impacts (PAI) reporting under the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR).
Monitoring the practical application of SFDR and developing Q&As or other tools for supervisory convergence.
Starting work on technical standards for ESG rating disclosures.
Developing guidelines for stress testing ESG risks under CRD6 and Solvency II.

Stewardship 
FRC consultation on revising the UK Stewardship Code 
Following the launch
opens in a new tab
of the Stewardship Code review in February 2024, and changes announced
opens in a new tab
in July, the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) has launched a public consultation
opens in a new tab
on revising the 2020 Stewardship Code. 
The consultation is wide-ranging and proposes some significant changes that aim to balance ongoing support for effective stewardship and high-quality disclosures, whilst removing unnecessary reporting burdens. This is set in the wider context of efforts to bolster UK capital markets. The proposals would broaden the definition of stewardship, streamline and amend the reporting process, restructure the Code's existing Principles with additional guidance, and permit cross-referencing to information disclosed outside of the stewardship report. Principles would also be introduced specifically for proxy advisors and investment consultants for the first time.
Subject to feedback, it is expected that a revised Code would be published in H1 2025 and take effect from January 2026. However, the timeline is to be confirmed and the FRC will provide further information in due course to ensure a smooth transition to the revised Code.

Climate and environment-related financial risk 
EIOPA recommends capital charges for fossil fuel assets
In its recent report on the prudential treatment of sustainability risks within Solvency II, EIOPA recommended
opens in a new tab
that insurers holding equities and bonds in the fossil fuel sector should face additional capital charges. For more information, see the article above.
`Fit-for-55' climate scenario analysis results
The ESAs have published the results
opens in a new tab
of the `Fit-for-55' climate scenario analysis which was based on three scenarios:
1. A baseline scenario where the `Fit-for-55' package is implemented in macroeconomic and financial conditions that facilitate an orderly green transition
2. An adverse scenario where risks stem from asset price corrections triggered by a sudden reassessment of transition risks (i.e. the `run on brown') 
3. A second adverse scenario that combines the above `run on brown' scenario with additional macroeconomic stress factors (e.g. geopolitical risk)
The results show that estimated losses stemming from a `run on brown' scenario have a limited impact on the EU financial system. First and second-round losses in scenario two range from between 6.8% and 11.2%. In scenario three, where the ESAs consider adverse macro-financial conditions, the first and second-round losses then increase to a range of 11% and 25%. 
The ESAs conclude that the interaction of adverse macro-financial risks with transition risk could substantially increase firms' losses. However, although these losses are sizeable, they could potentially be mitigated by firms' income and cash holdings. 
PRA Dear CFO letter on climate risk
The PRA has shared thematic feedback
opens in a new tab
with banks on accounting for IFRS 9 expected credit losses (ECL) and climate risk. For more information, see the article above.
NGFS updates macro-financial scenarios for climate risk assessment 
The Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) has published
opens in a new tab
its latest iteration of climate risk scenarios. The updated scenarios include the most recent country-level climate commitments as of March 2024, as well as a new 'damage function' which integrates the latest scientific evidence about the economic impacts of a warming climate. In all scenarios, the impact of physical risk rapidly outweighs the impact of transition efforts. The NGFS notes that limiting the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees in an orderly fashion is within reach but will require substantially more intensive efforts. 
Publication of new Climate Financial Risk Forum guides 
The Climate Financial Risk Forum (CFRF), a financial services industry forum established jointly by the FCA and the PRA in 2019, has published
opens in a new tab
three new guides on key areas of climate risk: nature-related risk, short-term scenarios and adaptation finance. The CFRF guides are written by industry, for industry, and are intended to help develop effective practice in relation to climate-related risks and opportunities. They do not necessarily reflect the views of regulators and do not constitute regulatory guidance.
The nature handbook
opens in a new tab
is an introduction for financial institutions to help frame nature as a risk, and discusses emerging practices in incorporating nature into financial risk management.
In response to growing interest in, and use of, short-term scenarios, the short-term scenarios guide
opens in a new tab
considers their various use cases for banks, asset managers and insurers. 
The guide
opens in a new tab
on mobilising adaptation finance provides industry with guidance in assessing physical risks, and facilitating increased levels of investment into climate adaptation to respond to those risks as an opportunity.
The Climate Resilience Dialogue's conclusions on narrowing the climate protection gap
The Climate Resilience Dialogue has issued a report
opens in a new tab
emphasising the need for collective action to address the climate insurance protection gap and build resilience to climate change. Key factors contributing to this climate protection gap include low risk awareness, limited data availability and affordability of insurance. Actions proposed in the report include: 
Raising risk awareness through accessible information campaigns
Conducting risk assessments based on robust data
Implementing adaptation measures and risk-based pricing in insurance
Increasing collaboration between public and private actors (including through public-private partnerships) 
Exploring insurance solutions like bundled insurance and parametric insurance 
The Climate Resilience Dialogue is a temporary group set up by the European Commission in 2022 to discuss climate insurance protection gaps in Europe and possible solutions to address them. The recommendations made in the report are not mandatory for insurers, supervisors or governments but they mirror previous reports from EIOPA on the insurance protection gap and are aligned with existing supervisory thinking/action in the EU. 
ESMA analysis on funds' exposures to physical climate risks 
ESMA has published
opens in a new tab
an analysis of funds' portfolio exposures to climate physical risks. It finds that, although their holdings' exposure to physical risk appears limited due to their ability to quickly rebalance portfolios and the short-term nature of their liabilities, some funds may still be exposed. Overall, the most prominent risks for EU funds arise from water-related hazards.
This is a research paper so has no direct policy implications for EU asset managers. However, ESMA notes that it will continue to monitor EU fund exposures to climate physical risks by incorporating some of the indicators discussed in the paper into its regular risk assessments.

Reporting and disclosures  
FSB report on globally consistent and comparable climate-related disclosures
The Financial Stability Board (FSB) has published a report
opens in a new tab
on achieving consistent and comparable climate-related disclosures. It concludes that significant progress has been made in setting internationally consistent disclosure standards, and notes that most FSB jurisdictions have regulations or roadmaps in place for such disclosures. However, the FSB also emphasises that further work is needed to help small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and emerging markets with their disclosures. 
IOSCO report on transition plans 
IOSCO has published its report
opens in a new tab
on transition plans, noting that while a range of frameworks and guidance is currently available, most jurisdictions do not have transition plan-specific regulations. IOSCO finds that market participants are increasingly looking to use transition plans for their decisions on capital allocation, portfolio constructions, risk assessment, pricing, valuation, product design and stewardship activities. 
The five most useful components of transition plan disclosures are identified as: 
1. Ambition and targets
2. Decarbonisation levers and action plan
3. Governance and oversight
4. Financial resources and human capital
5. Financial implications
The report also highlights future action that IOSCO and its stakeholders can take in the areas of:
Encouraging consistency and comparability through guidance on transition plan disclosures
Promoting assurance of transition plan disclosures 
Enhancing legal and regulatory clarity and oversight 
Building capacity
FCA good and poor practice for SDR pre-contractual disclosures
The FCA has provided
opens in a new tab
examples of good and poor practice for labelled funds and their pre-contractual disclosures under the Sustainability Disclosure Requirements (SDR) regime. Examples of good practice for two Sustainability Focus funds and one Sustainability Improvers fund are provided. No examples are provided for Impact or Mixed Goals funds but the FCA states that much of the illustrative practice should be relevant to all labels.
Examples of good practice include specific sustainability objectives, and clear explanations as to why the standard was chosen and how compliance will be monitored. Poor practice examples include not disclosing manager override for asset selection, and where the disclosed asset selection process does not link to the specified sustainability objective. 
Temporary flexibility for firms on SDR naming and marketing rules
The FCA has announced
opens in a new tab
 temporary flexibility, in certain narrowly defined circumstances, for fund managers to comply with the SDR naming and marketing rules. The standard deadline is 2 December 2024, but firms meeting the specified conditions will have until 2 April 2025 to comply with the rules. Where firms can comply with the rules without requiring any flexibility, the FCA requires them to do so. It also expects firms to comply with the rules as soon as they can, without waiting until 2 April 2025. 
Temporary flexibility is permitted where the fund manager: 
Submitted a completed application for approval of amended disclosures in line with ESG 5.3.2R for that fund by 1 October 2024 [ESG 5.3.2R sets out pre-contractual disclosure requirements where firms use a label or restricted terms]; and
Is currently using one or more of the terms `sustainable', `sustainability' or `impact' (or a variation of those terms) in the name of that fund and is intending either to use a label, or to change the name of that fund.
All other aspects of the SDR implementation timeline for UK funds remain unchanged. More broadly, the FCA's final SDR rules for portfolio managers have been delayed until Q2 2025, and a UK government consultation on extending the SDR to EEA funds was due in Q3 2024 but has not yet been published.
ESMA fund name guidelines translated and published 
ESMA has translated and published
opens in a new tab
its ESG fund name guidelines in all EU languages. The guidelines applied to new funds from 21 November 2024 and will apply to existing funds from 21 May 2025. The naming guidelines are an interim measure while the EU reforms the SFDR to tighten up the requirements that apply to funds that claim to have ESG characteristics. Fund managers should ramp up their implementation programs to ensure that they are prepared for the deadlines. This means immediately adapting the product manufacturing process for new funds and undertaking a review of all existing funds.
ESAs' latest annual report on SFDR PAI disclosures
The European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs) have published
opens in a new tab
 their third annual report to the European Commission on the disclosure of entity- and product-level principal adverse impact (PAI) disclosures under the SFDR. Overall, they find that the accessibility of PAI disclosures and quality of disclosed information have improved compared to the previous year. In this year's report, the ESAs have also included recommendations to National Competent Authorities (NCAs) to increase supervisory convergence and good practice for market participants. The latter should be reviewed in detail by firms.

Markets  
UK government response to consultation on regulating ESG ratings providers 
The UK government has published
opens in a new tab
its response to the consultation which closed at the end of June 2023, together with draft legislation to bring ESG ratings providers into regulation. The consultation response sets out the details of the scope of the regulatory regime, including which activities will be captured, and this is presented in a draft Statutory Instrument (SI) to amend the Regulatory Activities Order. The government will finalise the legislation in 2025 and the FCA will then consult on the specific requirements. Technical comments on the draft SI can be submitted until 14 January 2025.
Compromise agreement on EU regulation of ESG rating activities  
The compromise agreement
opens in a new tab
on the regulation of ESG ratings activities in the EU has been published, updated by the European Parliament at the October 21-24 session. The agreement aims to ensure that ESG ratings are `independent, comparable where possible, impartial, systematic and of adequate quality'. Once the European Council
opens in a new tab
has given its final approval, the legislative act will be adopted. 
IOSCO final report on voluntary carbon markets 
IOSCO has published its final report
opens in a new tab
 on promoting the integrity and orderly functioning of voluntary carbon markets. It highlights 21 good practices that address five key principles of financial market regulation:  
1. Clear and effective regulatory frameworks that provide legal certainty and proportional oversight
2. Enhanced transparency in carbon credit creation, trading and use
3. Strong governance standards, risk management frameworks, and policies to address conflicts of interest within the carbon credit ecosystem
4. Comprehensive market surveillance to detect and prevent fraud, abuse, and disruptive behaviours
5. Open, fair, and accessible trading for all participants, and standardization to boost market liquidity
The report is not a policy statement or regulation, but instead offers guidance for developing and operating voluntary carbon markets. 
ESMA market report on EU carbon markets 
ESMA's first annual report
opens in a new tab
on EU carbon markets provides updates on prices, volatility, auctions, trading and positions, and finds that there are no significant issues affecting the functioning of the markets. 
The 2024 report builds on ESMA's 2022 report
opens in a new tab
on the trading of emission allowances and finds that, overall, there are neither significant issues affecting the functioning of EU carbon markets function nor any new major policy issues. Most of the policy recommendations from the 2022 report have been either fully or partially implemented. As ESMA continues to monitor carbon market developments, it may conduct further policy analysis in future.
UK government principles for the integrity of voluntary carbon and nature markets 
On November 15, at COP29, the UK government put forward a set of principles
opens in a new tab
for the integrity of voluntary carbon and nature markets. The six principles have been launched in response to concerns about the quality and integrity of some credits available in the market and how they are used to make claims about environmental impact. To use credits responsibly and appropriately as part of meeting their climate or environment goals, buyers such as businesses or other organisations should:  
1. Use credits in addition to ambitious actions within value chains
2. Use high integrity credits
3. Measure and disclose the planned use of credits as part of sustainability reporting
4. Plan ahead (where organisations are making relevant transition plan disclosures)
5. Make accurate green claims using appropriate terminology
6. Co-operate with others to support the growth of high integrity markets
The government will consult in early 2025 on how the principles could be applied through guidance, standards and regulatory oversight.
UK government consults on Green Taxonomy
Following the Chancellor's Mansion House speech (see above), the UK government is consulting
opens in a new tab
on the value case for a UK Green Taxonomy. The primary purpose of the consultation is to establish whether a UK Taxonomy would be additional and complementary to existing policies in meeting the objectives of mitigating greenwashing and channelling capital in support of the government's sustainability objectives. The government has requested market and regulatory use cases as well as feedback on how to maximise the usability of a UK Taxonomy, with particular consideration of key design features and challenges. At this stage, the government is not seeking detailed feedback on specific activity-level standards. The consultation closes on 6 February 2025.

https://kpmg.com/xx/en/our-insights/ai-and-technology/unlocking-the-opportunities-of-ai-as-audit-enters-a-new-age.html,AI and Technology,Unlocking the opportunities of AI as Audit enters a new age,,"Larry Bradley, Leadership | 14 December 2023
Everywhere you look, businesses are integrating AI into their systems, processes, and customer interactions, to increase insight, efficiency and responsiveness. Generative AI in particular has captured the public’s imagination to become a hot area of focus.
Across industries AI has the potential to unlock greater value, and I believe that audit is no exception. In fact, bringing AI into audit is a natural next step on the ongoing digital journey, which has already seen the introduction of transformative data analysis and machine learning capabilities. In fact, 72% of financial reporting leaders in the US believe that external auditors are ahead of financial reporting functions on using AI, and expect them to be using AI to enhance audit quality1.
KPMG has established a strong mindset of innovation through our smart audit platform, KPMG Clara, which KPMG firms are using to serve audit clients globally. KPMG Clara is designed to deliver a consistent risk focused audit, with embedded digital audit capabilities, leveraging data directly from client financial systems to enable improved client collaboration capabilities. As just one example, KPMG firms’ audits around the world now perform automated matching of cash to revenue using data from client accounting systems.
Earlier this month, KPMG launched its KPMG Trusted AI approach, built on the principles of fairness, transparency, explainability, accountability, data integrity, reliability, security, safety, privacy, and sustainability.  The ten-pillar guide is KPMG’s strategic framework to help design, build, deploy, and use AI tech solutions in a responsible and ethical manner while also accelerating value and making the difference for clients, people and communities. Based upon the fundamental framework, we are also developing an approach to how we implement such principles specifically to audit.

Embedding AI in the audit

Today, with the KPMG Clara platform, KPMG professionals are applying AI with its diverse facets such as machine learning, deep learning and large language models.
We are prioritizing our investment in AI because we recognize the massive potential to enhance audit quality while also helping KPMG audit professionals work smarter. For example, AI can interrogate vast amounts of data to identify risks and, through automated analysis, generate audit evidence. Instead of manually auditing random samples of transactions, KPMG teams are using AI to analyze complete data populations and identify outliers and high-risk transactions to help laser-focus attention in relevant areas. AI enables auditors to spend more time on higher risk areas, which helps drive quality and insight in the audit.

‘Piloting’ the future

KPMG audit teams are seeing that the mode of AI usage can be fine-tuned according to different purposes, making it an adaptable tool. AI capabilities can cover a wide spectrum from “co-piloting” capabilities, which support the day-to-day work of an auditor to “auto-piloting” capabilities which perform analysis and generate audit evidence responding to specific financial and non-financial risks. Auto-piloting requires the highest degrees of transparency, explainability and the ability to reperform the analysis, while co-piloting leverages citations and model fine-tuning to guide prompts to the adequate knowledge and data source. Importantly, KPMG audit teams are the ‘captains’ controlling and guiding the process and reviewing the results for quality and accuracy. And they are leading the continuous ‘training’ of the AI through their subject matter accounting, auditing, and industry expertise.

Microsoft Alliance

Recognizing the enormous possibilities offered by AI, KPMG invested in an expanded multibillion dollar alliance with Microsoft focusing on generative AI and cloud services giving KPMG firms access to new technology and industry-leading innovation.
As a global network of firms, KPMG can harness the innovations in AI from teams around the world. This means the entire KPMG network can benefit from the latest innovations, wherever they are made.
Already, there are a host of AI tools in use across the network, including tools relating to predictive analytics, content search and summarization, document intelligence and tie-out procedures.   I believe this is going to become a golden age of innovation, and exciting times for KPMG audit teams serving clients.

The future is now

The journey ahead is incredibly exciting and is set to be transformational for KPMG professionals, KPMG firms’ clients and their stakeholders. No one can know quite how far and how fast AI will develop in the coming years – but it is certainly going to take us to some new places, in audit as in other professions and branches of business. The next generation of audit is fast becoming a reality, and KPMG is proud to be at the forefront of making it happen.

Resolution assessments: in CP12/24
opens in a new tab
, the PRA has proposed amendments to reporting and disclosure dates for the UK Resolvability Assessment Framework (RAF). Specifically, the timing of future submissions would no longer be fixed to two-year cycles. Relevant firms would continue to be subject to reporting and disclosure obligations on their resolvability, but on a periodic basis, with more details to be set out in subsequent changes to SS4/19. 
BoE amendments to the approach to setting MREL: the BoE is consulting
opens in a new tab
until 15 January 2025 on updates to its Statement of Policy (SoP) for setting a minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL). The proposals are designed to simplify and consolidate the UK's existing MREL framework and make it easier to navigate and implement. The BoE is also seeking to ensure that the framework remains up to date with, and able to respond to, wider developments in financial regulation and markets, that it remains aligned with international standards and that it can adapt over time to reflect lessons learnt. The consultation closes on 15 January 2025. 
Large exposures framework: the PRA is consulting (CP14/24)
opens in a new tab
on implementing the remaining elements of the BCBS large exposures framework. The key proposals include removing the use of internal model methods when calculating exposure values to securities financing transactions and introducing a mandatory substitution approach to calculate the effect of credit mitigation techniques. 
Prudential assessment of acquisitions and increases in control: the PRA and FCA have issued a joint policy statement (PS18/24
opens in a new tab
) providing feedback to responses received to CP 25/23 and final rules. There are no material differences between PS18/24 and CP25/23, but there are new paragraphs, for example on partnership structures and due diligence, and clarifications, including of what constitutes significant influence. The new policy took effect on 1 November.

Capital Markets and Asset Management

Bonds and derivatives transparency: the FCA has published PS 24/14
opens in a new tab
 (PDF 2.9MB) on improving the transparency of the bonds and derivatives market. The PS includes changes to the onshored MiFIR regime to: 
– revise the transparency framework for the bond and derivative markets in the UK
– define scope and calibration of the new framework
– clarify exemptions from post-trade transparency
– improve the content of post-trade information: fields and flags
– refine the definition of a Systematic Internaliser (SI).
The FCA's aim is to is to improve the operation of the existing transparency regime by establishing a better balance between supporting the ability of market participants to offer liquidity, and improved and more timely transparency for the market as a whole. The publication also includes as discussion paper on the future of the SI regime.
Investment research payment optionality for fund managers: the FCA is consulting
opens in a new tab
on allowing UK fund management firms the option to make joint payments for research and execution to brokers. This would bring research payment options for fund managers into line with changes already introduced for UK MiFID firms via PS24/9. If fund managers decide to take up this option, they would need to provide their investors with 60 days' notice before going ahead, ensure that certain guardrails are in place and disclosures are made. The FCA's proposed changes would deliver on recommendations outlined in the 2023 UK Investment Research Review.
UK EMIR bilateral margin requirements: the FCA and PRA published PS24/13
opens in a new tab
finalising changes to the UK EMIR bilateral margin requirements (BTS 2016/2251). The amendments are necessary to reflect the expected changes to UK EMIR that will be made in the Securitisation (Amendment) Regulations 2024. The amendments came into force on 1 November 2024.

on revising the 2020 Stewardship Code. The consultation is wide-ranging and proposes significant changes that aim to balance ongoing support for effective stewardship and high-quality disclosures whilst removing unnecessary reporting burdens. This is set against the wider context of efforts to bolster UK capital markets. The FRC's proposals would broaden the definition of stewardship, streamline and amend the reporting process, restructure the Code's existing Principles with additional guidance, and permit cross-referencing to information disclosed outside of the stewardship report. For the first time, principles would also be introduced specifically for proxy advisors and investment consultants. A revised Code is expected to be published in H1 2025 and take effect from January 2026.
Private markets: Nikhil Rathi, FCA CEO, gave a speech
opens in a new tab
on risks and opportunities relating to private assets, and the regulatory direction of travel. Headlines from the speech touched on:
Private market risks and opportunities: Rathi noted the benefits of private markets but stated regulators need more transparency, consideration of liquidity risks and retail investor education.
Innovation: nine LTAFs have been authorised and some of them support the transition to net zero. Rathi reminded firms of the industry's blueprint for tokenising funds and the FCA's digital securities sandbox.
Value and fees: Rathi stated the FCA is open to a 'holistic discussion' of what it really wants in terms of fair value.
Proportionate regulation: Rathi indicated the FCA will collaborate with industry in 2025 on the review of AIFMD Annex IV reporting. 
Talent and skills: Rathi noted that the UK's competitive advantage in talent needs 'nurturing' and that firms need to keep investing in capacity and skills. He noted that only 12% of portfolio managers are female - a statistic that has not improved in recent years. Rathi also noted the importance of financial education.

Solvency II:
opens in a new tab
The PRA has published PS15/24
opens in a new tab
on the restatement of assimilated law. This is the final policy statement to implement the conclusions of the Solvency II review. It finalises PRA rules, policy material, reporting and disclosure templates, and Insurance Special Purpose Vehicle (ISPV) templates and instructions that will replace Solvency II assimilated law. It also confirms the PRA's final rules and policy material for areas where near-final rules were provided in previous policy statements. The statement largely confirms the near-final rules, while providing clarifications in several areas including aspects of rules relating to loss absorbing capacity of deferred taxes, ring-fenced funds and Transitional Measure on Technical Provisions (TMTP).
PRA consults on reforms to UK ISPVs: the PRA has published CP15/24
opens in a new tab
on reforming the UK ISPV regulatory framework. The PRA proposes to consider applications for certain UK ISPVs, relating to natural catastrophe bonds, within ten working days, rather than the current period of four to six weeks, and make it easier for a wider range of market practices to be undertaken in the UK. The consultation closes on 14 February 2025.
HMT Treasury consults on captives regime: the government is consulting
opens in a new tab
on a new approach to captive insurance companies (vehicles for self-insuring risk from companies within the same group). The consultation will be welcomed by insurers and corporates as a step towards levelling the regulatory playing field with jurisdictions that have established themselves as hubs for captives. It is high level and does not set out specific policy proposals. Instead, it seeks views on the merits of establishing a dedicated captives regime, its potential scope and exclusions, and the applicable regulatory framework (conduct and prudential) and regulatory approach to captive managers.

Retail Conduct

Motor finance commission: the FCA has published
opens in a new tab
a consultation on proposals to extend the time firms have to respond non-discretionary commission motor finance complaints.  This covers any motor finance complaint where there was a commission arrangement not already subject to the new DCA complaint rules. This has been driven by the Court of Appeal’s judgment in the cases of Hopcraft, Johnson and Wrench, which decided that the broker’s receipt of commission from the lender was unlawful without obtaining the customer’s informed consent to the payment. The proposed rules mirror the DCA complaint rules in most respects, however two options for the extension end date are proposed: 
4 December 2025 - to align end dates for the pause with DCA complaints), or  
31 May 2025 - when the FCA estimate the Supreme Court will have reached a decision on whether to grant permission to appeal  
In an earlier call with market analysts, FCA CEO Nikhil Rathi noted that, pending any further information from the Supreme Court, “motor finance lenders and brokers are required to comply with the Johnson judgment both for new business and when responding to relevant complaints”.   
Premium finance: the FCA has announced
opens in a new tab
a new market study to investigate the premium finance market alongside the new government insurance taskforce. The study aims to assess the effectiveness of competition and quality of consumer outcomes within the market. As part of the study, the FCA will review whether the products represent fair value, how well customers are made aware of their financing options, the role of commission and other potential barriers to effective competition in the motor and home premium finance market. The taskforce, which includes the FCA, aims to identify actions that may stabilise or reduce motor insurance premiums, while maintaining appropriate levels of cover.
Buy-Now Pay Later: HMT has published
opens in a new tab
its long-awaited consultation on the regulation of Buy-Now Pay-Later (BNPL) products. The proposed framework brings BNPL firms within scope of the Consumer Credit Act (CCA) and under the regulatory oversight of the FCA. Once legislation has been finalised, the FCA will set out the rules for BNPL firms including information disclosure requirements, affordability and creditworthiness checks, and FOS complaint rights. BNPL firms will also be subject to the Consumer Duty. Agreements financing insurance are not in scope of the legislation. Other exemptions include merchants which provide their own short-term interest-free products and those that offer BNPL at the point of sale in store. Reflecting concerns about the risk of pressure selling, domestic premises suppliers which offer BNPL will fall within the FCA's regulatory perimeter. Final legislation is expected to be laid in Parliament in early 2025 with the regime in effect by 2026. 
Portfolio letters - FCA strategy 2025: the FCA has issued a series of portfolio letters outlining its strategic priorities for several sectors in 2025. Portfolios covered are retail banks

, life time mortgage providers
opens in a new tab
, non-bank mortgage lenders and mortgage third-party administrators
opens in a new tab
, financial advisers (FAs) and investment intermediaries (IIs)
opens in a new tab
, and SIPP Operators
opens in a new tab
. The importance of good governance and controls and the delivery of good customer outcomes is a key message in all the letters. As such, the adequacy and effectiveness of this control environment will form a central plank of FCA supervisory activity. The banking, building societies and mortgage lending portfolios share a number of common themes: 
Operational resilience
Consumer Duty implementation
Customers in financial distress
Financial crime
Sustainable finance
The FCA expects retail banks to ensure that customers are not excluded from bank accounts and services. For building societies and mortgage lenders, there is also focus on financial resilience.
Aside from Consumer Duty considerations, the focus areas for SIPP Operators and financial advisers and investment intermediaries differ. For the latter, priority areas include retirement income advice, ongoing advice services and firm consolidation. For SIPP operators, the priorities centre on the discharge of redress liabilities for due diligence failures and the handling and record keeping of scheme money and assets - a growing area of concern. The FCA has not seen the sector make sufficient progress addressing concerns from its 2023 letter, therefore the also remain relevant.
Consumer credit and non-bank mortgage lenders: The FCA's multi-firm review
opens in a new tab
of the financial resilience of consumer credit firms and non-bank mortgage lenders (NBML) found that improvements were required to firms' approaches to risk governance and risk management. The FCA identified three themes - inadequate risk identification and monitoring, under-developed risks and controls, and insufficient wind-down planning. 
Professional representatives case fees: the FOS has published
opens in a new tab
correspondence with the FCA Chair confirming its decision, subject to parliamentary approval of enabling legislation, to introduce case fees for professional representatives (PRs) - e.g. Law firms and CMCs. Largely unchanged from the consultation, PRs will be charged case fees of £250 PRs, reduced to £75 if the case is upheld, where a case is upheld against a PR the fee for the respondent firm will be reduced by £175. The FOS is increasing the number of free cases from three to ten to enable PRs to apply learnings for subsequent cases. Subject to secondary legislation and a FCA FEES instrument, FOS consider the fees could be applied from early 2025. 
Complaints data: H1 2024 data
opens in a new tab
from the FOS shows a 40% increase in complaints volumes, continuing a trend seen over the last couple of years. Banking and consumer credit continue to be the most complained about sector, showing year on year increases. Complaints brought by Professional Representatives (PRs) also continue to rise, accounting for 50% of banking and credit complaints. Disputes about credit cards, unaffordable lending, car finance as well as fraud and scams were the main driver for the rise in these complaints. Much of the increase, and the increasing involvement of PRs, is likely being driven by the FCA's ongoing work on discretionary commission arrangements in motor finance.

Payments

National payments vision: the government has published its National Payments Vision (NPV) setting a clear vision recognising the importance of payments to the UK economy and the need to change the status quo. The NPV sets actions to strengthen the foundations of the payments ecosystem and outlines three key pillars designed to guide future activity – innovation, competition and security. Read more on the NPV here

. 
Consumer Duty implementation: the FCA has published
opens in a new tab
the outcomes of its review into payments firms' implementation of the Consumer Duty. It found that just under half of the firms reviewed presented a moderate or higher risk of delivering poor consumer outcomes due to insufficient implementation of Consumer Duty, raising concerns that a substantial minority of payment firms may be uncompliant with the Duty. This included target markets being set too widely, insufficient agent oversight, insufficient explanations of fair value assessment outcomes and a lack of demonstrable consideration of the Duty in governance arrangements. 
 APP Fraud: the FCA has written to the CEOs of payment and e-money institutions
opens in a new tab
, and banks and building societies
opens in a new tab
, outlining its expectations of firms surrounding the new APP fraud reimbursement rules. These centre on anti-fraud systems and controls, interplay with the Consumer Duty, and the handling of 'on us' APP fraud. Additionally, the FCA reminds payment and e-money firms of the importance of considering capital and liquidity implications in light of the new rules.

Pensions

with only minor amendments made to clarify requirements. Whilst the FCA's approach is now clearer, the launch of private sector dashboards is still some way into the future as the Government has directed the Pensions Dashboard Programme to focus on the connection and launch of the non-commercial dashboard provided by MaPS (MoneyHelper), before turning to commercial dashboard service connection.
Collective Defined Contribution (CDC) schemes: The Pensions Regulator (TPR) has issued
opens in a new tab
its compliance and enforcement policy for CDC pension schemes which outlines how providers can expect it to supervise them. TPR will supervise CDC schemes through a collaborative and proportionate process, with an emphasis on preventing compliance breaches and harm to savers. Schemes will receive an annual evaluation, which will set out the TPRs intended supervisory intensity, the key risks observed, expectations and planned future engagement timetable.

Digital Finance and Innovation

Project Guardian: The FCA has welcomed the publication of Project Guardian's report on fund tokenisation. The report sets out a phased vision of how distributed ledger technology (DLT) can be used in asset management for fund tokenisation, and discusses standards needed to scale use cases for tokenisation, enabling firms and investors to benefit. The FCA also announced that it will collaborate with the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) in 2025 to explore tokenisation considerations for the wider wealth and asset management sector.

ESG and Sustainable Finance

PRA Dear CFO letter on climate risk: the PRA has shared thematic feedback
opens in a new tab
with banks on accounting for IFRS 9 expected credit losses (ECL) and climate risk. For more information, see the article above.
Updated NGFS climate risk scenarios: the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) has published
opens in a new tab
its latest iteration of climate risk scenarios. The updated scenarios include the most recent country-level climate commitments as of March 2024, as well as a new 'damage function' which integrates the latest scientific evidence about the economic impacts of a warming climate. In all scenarios, the impact of physical risk rapidly outweighs the impact of transition efforts. The NGFS notes that limiting the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees in an orderly fashion is within reach but will require substantially more intensive efforts. 
New CFRF guides: the Climate Financial Risk Forum (CFRF), a financial services industry forum established jointly by the FCA and the PRA in 2019, has published
opens in a new tab
3 new guides on key areas of climate risk: nature-related risk, short-term scenarios and adaptation finance. The CFRF's guides are written by industry, for industry and are intended to help develop effective practice in relation to climate-related risks and opportunities. They do not necessarily reflect the views of regulators and do not constitute regulatory guidance.
FCA good and poor practice for SDR pre-contractual disclosures: the FCA has published
opens in a new tab
examples of good and poor practice for labelled funds and their pre-contractual disclosures under the Sustainability Disclosure Requirements (SDR) regime. Examples are provided for two Sustainability Focus funds and one Sustainability Improvers fund. None are provided for Impact or Mixed Goals funds, but the FCA notes that much of the illustrative practice should be relevant to all labels. Examples of good practice include specific sustainability objectives and clear explanations as to why the standard was chosen and how compliance will be monitored. Examples of poor practice include not disclosing manager override for asset selection, and where the disclosed asset selection process does not link to the specified sustainability objective. 
Temporary flexibility for firms on SDR naming and marketing rules: the FCA has announced
opens in a new tab
temporary flexibility, in certain narrowly defined circumstances, for fund managers to comply with the SDR naming and marketing rules. The standard deadline is 2 December 2024, but firms meeting the specified conditions will have until 2 April 2025 to comply with the rules. Where firms can comply with the rules without requiring any flexibility, the FCA requires them to do so. It also expects firms to comply with the rules as soon as they can, without waiting until 2 April 2025. 
All other aspects of the SDR implementation timeline for UK funds remain unchanged. More broadly, the FCA's final SDR rules for portfolio managers have been delayed until Q2 2025, and a UK government consultation on extending the SDR to EEA funds was due in Q3 2024 but has not yet been published.
Case for a UK Green Taxonomy: the UK government is consulting
opens in a new tab
on the value case for a UK Green Taxonomy. The primary purpose of the consultation is to establish whether a UK Taxonomy would be additional and complementary to existing policies in meeting the objectives of mitigating greenwashing and channelling capital in support of the government's sustainability objectives. The government has requested market and regulatory use cases as well as feedback on how to maximise the usability of a UK Taxonomy, with particular consideration of key design features and challenges. At this stage, the government is not seeking detailed feedback on specific activity-level standards. The consultation closes on 6 February 2025. 
Regulating ESG ratings providers: the UK government has published
opens in a new tab
its response to the consultation which closed at the end of June 2023, together with draft legislation to bring ESG ratings providers into regulation. The consultation response sets out the details of the scope of the regulatory regime, including which activities will be captured, and this is presented in a draft Statutory Instrument (SI) to amend the Regulatory Activities Order. The government will finalise the legislation in 2025 and the FCA will then consult on the specific requirements. Technical comments on the draft SI can be submitted until 14 January 2025.
Integrity of voluntary carbon and nature markets: the UK government has put forward a set of principles
opens in a new tab
for the integrity of voluntary carbon and nature markets. The six principles have been launched in response to concerns about the quality and integrity of some credits available in the market and how they are used to make claims about environmental impact. To use credits responsibly and appropriately as part of meeting their climate or environment goals, buyers such as businesses or other organisations, should:
Use credits in addition to ambitious actions within value chains
Use high integrity credits
Measure and disclose the planned use of credits as part of sustainability reporting
Plan ahead (where organisations are making relevant transition plan disclosures)
Make accurate green claims using appropriate terminology
Co-operate with others to support the growth of high integrity markets
The government will consult in early 2025 on how the principles could be applied through guidance, standards and regulatory oversight.

What's the issue?

Materiality plays a critical role under the IFRS® Sustainability Disclosure Standards1. Companies make materiality judgements based on their individual facts and circumstances to focus their reporting on information that is useful to investors, rather than simply providing all the information listed in the standards. 
Companies make judgements to determine both the sustainability-related topics they need to report on and the information they provide about them.

Companies will need a clear understanding of what information could affect an investor's assessment of their long-term prospects to make materiality judgements. These judgements help them provide real insight into how they are managing the sustainability-related risks and opportunities that drive their success.

What are the requirements?

Under the standards, information is material if omitting, misstating or obscuring it could reasonably be expected to influence decisions that the primary users of general-purpose financial reporting make on the basis of that reporting. This is the same basis that is applied under IFRS Accounting Standards. 
To help companies make these judgements, the standards explain that primary users’ decisions depend on their assessments of:
the amount, timing and uncertainty of the company’s future cash flows; and
management’s stewardship of the company’s economic resources.
Information that could reasonably be expected to influence these decisions is considered material. This is the case whether the information is quantitative or qualitative.
The standards focus on primary users’ common information needs, so companies are not required to consider the specialist needs of individual investors.

What’s the impact?

The basis for assessing materiality is inherently forward-looking. This means that:
information about a sustainability-related risk or opportunity that has not yet affected the company’s financial statements may still be considered material – e.g. because it provides insight into the resilience of the company’s business model; and
information about the company’s exposure to future events (e.g. possible regulatory changes) may be material, even though the potential outcome is uncertain.
Companies make materiality judgements based on the influence that information could reasonably be expected to have on primary users’ decisions at the reporting date. They do not need to provide information about every possible risk or opportunity.
How is this different from materiality judgements applied under other frameworks and standards?
Some sustainability reporting frameworks and standards are designed to meet the needs of a different set of stakeholders. They specify a different approach to determining materiality. For example, GRI Standards require a process of stakeholder engagement to identify the impacts and topics about which information may be material.  
Companies that are already experienced in sustainability reporting may find that applying the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) investor-focused definition of materiality requires a significant change in their current approach. While many sustainability-related matters important to other stakeholders can create risks or opportunities for the company, investors may need different information about these matters.
The double materiality concept in the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) requires companies to assess materiality from both a ‘financial’ and an ‘impact’ perspective. EFRAG and the ISSB have released joint interoperability guidance which highlights that the definition of financial materiality is aligned under IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards and ESRS and that 'the two assessments are expected to provide an aligned outcome'.  This means that information that is financially material under ESRS is likely to be material under the IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards. However, companies will still need to consider the relevant disclosure requirements under each set of standards when deciding what information to report.

Actions for management

Familiarise yourself with the standards and understand what they would require.
Use the ISSB’s guidance when making materiality judgements.
Review your existing process for making materiality judgements over sustainability-related information to ensure that: 
it is aligned with the ISSB’s investor-focused approach;
the rigour applied and audit committee involvement is consistent with that applied for the financial statements; and
appropriate documentation is in place to protect against hindsight challenge.

The last two years have seen significant increases in the proportion of companies publishing carbon reduction targets.The proportion of companies reporting on biodiversity remains lower but has similarly increased since 2022.
The survey finds growth in practices that will soon be mandatory in some jurisdictions, including the EU’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD). The report includes insights from KPMG member firms and draws on the expertise of KPMG subject matter specialists worldwide.

Six major trends from the report

Reporting on sustainability and setting carbon targets has become part of business as usual.
Some companies have already changed practices in advance of the move to mandatory reporting on sustainability under the EU’s CSRD.
Double materiality, required under CSRD, is now used by half of the largest companies.
Despite moves toward mandatory reporting, voluntary guidelines and standards remain widely-used.
Reporting on biodiversity continues to increase.
Adoption of Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations has continued to increase with IFRS S2 ready to rise.

About the survey

The Survey of Sustainability Reporting 2024 is based on detailed research by KPMG professionals representing 58 member firms. For each country, territory or jurisdiction listed below, they have reviewed annual financial, integrated and ESG/sustainability reports published by the largest 100 companies. With data from 5,800 companies this edition is jointly the most comprehensive in the series, which has run since 1993.

– Your questions answered

Materiality judgements are fundamental to sustainability reporting – they determine the volume, type and precision of information to be reported. To meet users’ information needs cost effectively, companies need to balance providing enough information about the topics that matter without obscuring useful information with immaterial content.  
Many companies are considering IFRS® Sustainability Disclosure Standards alongside other frameworks that take a different approach to materiality, such as GRI1 Standards or European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS). Understanding how the principles in these different standards fit together practically is essential for companies wanting a robust and efficient process.

What’s the issue?

The International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) has issued guidance
opens in a new tab
that can help companies to understand and apply its approach to materiality.
The ISSBTM guidance explains:
how companies identify sustainability-related risks and opportunities that could reasonably be expected to affect their prospects; and
how they determine whether information about them is material.
Having identified sustainability-related risks and opportunities that could reasonably be expected to affect their prospects, the guidance suggests a four-step process2 to support companies in making materiality judgements about what information to provide.

What’s the impact?

To report effectively under IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards, it is essential that companies understand the ISSB’s approach to materiality. The additional guidance will help companies to understand the conceptual principles in its Standards and support them in preparing for first-time reporting.
The guidance includes some observations around the interoperability of the ISSB’s approach with ESRS, building on the earlier joint statement from EFRAG3 and the ISSB.
The four-step process in the guidance can help companies establish due process over their sustainability reporting materiality judgements. It may be particularly helpful for those companies that are new to sustainability reporting or that currently report sustainability-related information under frameworks that do not focus on investor needs.

The annual Leaders 2050 report reveals that two thirds (66 percent) of respondents feel responsible for driving Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) impact in their organizations, but only 10% feel they have the autonomy or are empowered to act.
The report, which surveyed over 800 young people (aged 18 to 35) across 48 countries, highlights the disconnect between the thoughts, perspectives and experiences of young people and those of senior leaders across both private and public sectors, when it comes to creating and establishing ESG strategies in business. It also emphasizes the value young people are placing on sustainability in their careers, community and personal lives.
A company’s approach to ESG is mentioned in the report as one of the key elements young professionals consider when selecting a career, with almost half (48 percent) of the respondents stating they would leave a job if their organization didn’t demonstrate a commitment to climate, sustainability and social impact. 63 percent also agree that they consider a company’s ESG credentials when selecting a potential employer.

Communication and transparency of a company’s sustainability strategy plays a pivotal part in building trust and improving a young professional’s engagement in the workforce, according to the findings. Furthermore, over half of the respondents (57 percent) cite ‘learning and development opportunity’ as a key tool, followed by ‘technology and digital tools’ (43 percent), and ‘external networking opportunities’ (40 percent).
On the road to net zero, the younger workforce note cost of decarbonization (29 percent) as the largest organizational barrier to meeting climate ambitions, closely followed by a lack of will from senior leaders (26 percent). As it stands, just half (49 percent) agree that their organizations have fully embedded ESG principals into their business strategies, and the same percentage believe that their ESG impact strategy is ‘middle of the pack’ compared to industry peers.
The report emphasizes that involving the next generation in collaboration and decision-making is not only vital in supporting ESG strategies, but for business survival, stating that if leaders fail to do so, they risk higher employee turnover, loss of staff confidence, lack of credibility and reputational risks.

Much like their counterparts worldwide, corporations across the region are realizing the need to align with international ESG standards to maintain competitiveness. At the same time, investors are increasingly focused on identifying companies with strong ESG practices, in recognition of the reality that addressing sustainability challenges is essential for long-term success.
These factors have made ESG reporting fundamental for companies to attract international investments and contribute to the stability of the economy overall. Corporates are working to identify opportunities and better align strategies with business outcomes through more effective risk management reporting and advancing more quickly toward value creation.
While major global regulatory frameworks lead the way, the Asia Pacific region presents a more fragmented and challenging landscape. Nevertheless, change is occurring. Many countries are introducing ISSB standards and there are encouraging developments in the form of policies that directly impact corporate financial performance, such as carbon pricing.
This report aims to help ESG practitioners and professionals understand the evolution of sustainability reporting regulations and guidelines in Asia Pacific. As our research illustrates, the ongoing evolution of sustainability-related reporting systems in the region reflects the unique economic and social conditions of each market, leading to a diverse landscape.

As we mark this important observance, we are reminded of the extraordinary challenges posed by the global economy, politics, and society – each presenting opportunities for fraudulent activities. The landscape of fraud is in a constant state of evolution, compelling businesses to maintain unwavering vigilance and perpetually assess the ever-emerging risks and the deleterious consequences that fraud inflicts upon stability and efforts to drive to growth. It's noteworthy that no industry remains impervious to such threats.
In response to these dynamic challenges, we have curated a selection of our impactful articles and insights, shedding light on the diverse facets of fraud risk within our strong global organization of firms. These include:

While these insights provide a multifaceted perspective on potential fraud-related risks, a common thread runs through them—fraud is a continually evolving phenomenon. Technology serves as a double-edged sword, enhancing our capacity to detect fraud while also facilitating criminal activities. The untapped potential of artificial intelligence introduces additional complexity. Recognizing and acknowledging potential risks are pivotal in the battle against fraud.
This underscores the vital importance of Fraud Week. We encourage vigilance, open communication with employees about fraud risk, the establishment of whistleblowing or 'speak up' hotlines, the conduct of comprehensive fraud risk assessments within organizations and the embracement of innovation to help mitigate risk by enhancing prevention and detection capabilities.

In the next decade, Artificial Intelligence (AI) will fundamentally transform the audit through automating procedures and enhancing audit quality.
I had the opportunity to speak with my colleague Matthew Campbell, Chief Technology Officer, KPMG in the UK and heard that: “There’s so much more to AI than automating simple tasks like analyzing data. AI can support all areas of the audit. From helping auditors to make more insightful judgments to providing a more robust challenge to management too.”
So, in the future, will AI replace humans in the audit process? That’s just one of the fascinating questions Matthew and I discussed when we chatted as part of our ‘All eyes on’ series. Here’s a summary of our conversation.

How is AI changing the audit and the way auditors work?

It’s the same way AI is changing every business and organization: automating, accelerating and enhancing business processes, helping to transform at scale and drive value. We believe that means delivering even higher quality audits. For example, we expect AI will continue to help KPMG firms to better identify high risk transactions, allowing us to sustain our focus on risk assessment and obtain audit evidence over much larger, more complex sets of data. Also, by removing some of the more time-consuming tasks for auditors, AI will free them up to apply valuable skills in other areas, again enhancing the audit for everyone.

How can AI impact businesses and specific industries?

KPMG firms are seeing a broad range of companies, regardless of industry, using AI alongside their workforce also in processes surrounding financial and non-financial accounting and reporting.
For example, in financial services we are seeing AI promoting greater inclusivity by analyzing broader and larger amounts of data. This could lead to more customers being offered mortgages and that could give a lender a significant competitive advantage.

What are the potential risks of AI?

First of all, it is critical AI is being built with the most accurate, unbiased and relevant data available. Secondly, companies often focus their investment in AI on growth strategies, customer focus or frontline operations and often underprioritize the investment in AI support, governance, risk and compliance. There are ethics and resilience issues to consider here too. Guidelines are needed and due to constant change, aspects must be continually monitored and addressed.
A key risk around AI, which is very relevant to audit, is ‘explainability’. By this we mean we still need to understand and explain why the technology may be highlighting certain items and trends. That’s why we believe it’s important to have people working alongside AI to prompt deeper thinking and challenge where necessary, rather than removing people from the loop entirely. At the same time, this will help training the AI continuously through human input.
Lastly, as with any new technologies, companies need to think carefully about the skill sets they need within their organization to achieve and to maximize the possibilities, recognizing that it won't be perfect straight away.

How is KPMG adapting to AI trend?

As businesses introduce more AI and ask us, as their auditors, to provide assurance, this is what we will continue to do. KPMG firms have already developed the know-how to help businesses and organizations adapt to (and even embrace) the cultural changes that AI brings. All within an ethical framework that helps manage responsible implementation.
One way we are adapting this is by using ‘Feature engineering’ to really shift the dial in anomaly detection. It will be able to spot behaviour outliers across the different data elements including identifying users that normally don’t post entries and suddenly do. Suddenly we’re not setting rules and looking for exceptions. AI will help us to find that needle in the haystack. Additionally, we’re using AI to help support processing of large datasets around natural language processing, voice and speech recognition.

Stronger together

KPMG has always believed that technology, including AI, has the potential to empower and enhance auditors in their day-to-day work and provide real value to an audit. But, we must never simply rely on AI as a black box; ‘explainability’ is key. That’s why we believe AI will never replace people and KPMG will always have human knowledge in the audit loop.
Throughout the All eyes on campaign, you will hear from various leaders on topics such as continuous auditing, big data and technology assurance. AI will have a strong correlation with all four of these other topics.

A new era of assurance over ESG and sustainability data is here. Technology plays a vital and growing role in the evolution of ESG, helping to drive strategy, operations, reporting and controls and governance. I had the opportunity to speak with KPMG colleagues Shahab Dayani, Director Technology & Data Analytics, KPMG Australia, Danielle Landesz Campen, Partner ESG Assurance, KPMG in the Netherlands, and Oliver Geier, Head of ESG Assurance Expert Group, KPMG in Germany on this trend and how it can benefit organizations in today’s fast-changing business and regulatory environment. Here’s a summary of our conversation., both of KPMG in Brazil. Here’s a summary of what we discussed.

Technology plays a crucial role in ESG assurance & reporting.  How is technology evolving audit and assurance and the way assurers work?

Unlike assurance over financial data, which has been around for a long time, assurance over ESG and sustainability data is emerging rapidly. Technology is embedded in almost everything that is done today, and that gives KPMG member firms an opportunity to help transform assurance over ESG and sustainability data, integrating technology into assurance procedures right from the start.
ESG data – and the systems that maintain and govern it – are at the heart of this transformation, enabling companies to track their ESG progress, disclose accurately and on time and, crucially, manage risks like data privacy, security, reliability, and non-compliance. As a result, companies can support environmental sustainability, be more resilient to climate change and geopolitical tensions, and have the potential to become more attractive to investors, customers, employees, and job seekers. This comes amid increasing pressure to report on ESG performance, comply with regulations, and satisfy investors and consumers. Many regulators and capital markets now expect non-financial reporting to meet the standards of financial reporting.
KPMG member firms see clients facing challenges today around the availability and quality of ESG and sustainability data. The ability to interpret data, and assure areas that cannot be easily quantified, is difficult. One way to perform such assurance work that can be explained with minimal bias is to enable it through technology. And this is first achieved on the client side using modern enterprise technology solutions for data governance, data quality and cloud technologies. With the right quality data and the right technology infrastructure in place, KPMG professionals see an opportunity to help clients automate the ESG reporting process. And by doing that, KPMG firms are enabling their assurance professionals to create traceable audit trails and move closer to real-time auditing.

How is KPMG leveraging technology to enable ESG assurance?

KPMG firms are embracing the advancement of technology as it relates to ESG activities. We recently released a standardized, cloud-based ESG assurance workflow that incorporates our assurance methodology which is aligned with global assurance standards and built on our smart technology platform, KPMG Clara. This is designed to provide a consistent user experience and assists KPMG professionals and clients in navigating the increasingly complex landscape of corporate reporting. With the help of KPMG alliance partners, member firms are also utilizing technologies such as AI and natural language processing to further enhance quality and deliver greater value to clients.
For example, KPMG firms are already using AI to help in areas such as sentiment analysis – implementing natural language processing and machine learning to read through clients’ climate reports and provide sentiment analysis that can help mitigate the risk of greenwashing. KPMG Australia recently worked with Microsoft
opens in a new tab
 to create capabilities leveraging OpenAI's large language models to evaluate structured ESG data in clients’ climate reports and compare them against regulatory reporting standards, such as the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB).

What are the potential risks of tech-enabled ESG assurance?

Given the complexity of existing regulations and the introduction of new ones, KPMG professionals believe there is an opportunity to build technology solutions that can help meet multiple regulatory requirements and that can be used across different processes, systems and geographies – helping to mitigate the risks of inaccuracy in reporting and tracking of ESG performance.
However, it’s a mistake to think this is just a technology challenge. You need a framework of strong controls (similar to financial reporting) encompassing an organization-wide effort from IT, ESG/sustainability, finance, operations, compliance, legal, product development, HR and sales and marketing. ESG-related risks have the potential to affect multiple areas of an organization beyond the ESG realm. Your technology must be incorporated into corporate governance using a holistic strategy.
There is still a long way to go before businesses can reach the same level of reliability and results that exist today in financial audit work, but the momentum is increasing.

According to the KPMG 2022 CEO Outlook, businesses are increasingly investing in new advanced technology, with over half of CEOs placing more emphasis on it. As these businesses adopt new technologies, such as robotic automation, artificial intelligence and blockchain, they tend to become more efficient and competitive. However, this digital transformation requires new ways of providing assurance over the use of technology, including protecting businesses from the new risks it brings.
This is what’s meant by ‘technology assurance’. In the face of these new risks, such as cyber attacks, companies need to be prepared with additional or redesigned internal controls to monitor and protect themselves. Along those same lines, the SEC proposes cybersecurity rules
opens in a new tab
 which seek to enhance and standardize risk management, strategy, governance and incident disclosures. The proposed rules would increase the prominence of required disclosure of cybersecurity incidents in several corporate filings, including annual and quarterly filings and current reports. The proposal would also require disclosure of a registrant’s policies and procedures to identify and manage cybersecurity risks; management’s role in implementing cybersecurity policies, procedures and strategies; as well as the board of directors’ oversight and expertise.
To delve deeper into this important topic, I spoke with Rodrigo Gonzalez, Head of Audit Innovation, and Ligia Costa, Audit Director, both of KPMG in Brazil. Here’s a summary of what we discussed.

How can technology assurance change the audit and the way auditors work?

Technology is quickly changing financial reporting. Machine learning, natural language processing and AI can automate tasks that would previously require time-consuming manual oversight. As part of the financial statement audit, auditors are now increasingly providing assurance over automation and even artificial intelligence used within the financial accounting organization of businesses.
As part of KPMG’s own digital transformation, our firms not only equip auditors with new technologies, through KPMG Clara, but also with the skills and competencies to thrive in a more digital world. The goal is to audit advanced technology with advanced technology, making financial audits more efficient and providing organizations with a better audit experience overall.
To illustrate what this means in practice, take cyber security for example. Cyber security is the body of technologies, processes and practices designed to protect networks, computers, programs and data from attacks, damage or unauthorized access. KPMG has developed sophisticated cyber security maturity assessments and assurance frameworks to help businesses operate technology in financial accounting with reliable quality and security. To do this, KPMG itself leverages certified bots and data and analytics capabilities.

How can blockchain impact businesses and specific industries?

Blockchain will open the possibility for businesses to capture and report richer datasets, using enormous amounts of additional metadata. For example, not just how much energy was used but at what times of day, in which forms (fossil fuel, wind, solar etc), in which locations, and more. Those granted access to the blockchain, such as management for internal decision making, can therefore gain a more complete view. With that, for this to really work, everyone involved needs to be granted access to the blockchain.
Different industries are likely to adopt blockchain at different rates, the time to market, depending on the nature of their business and the complexity of their supply chains. There is clear potential for oil & gas, for example, as they are such heavy users of energy. Other industries with product-heavy business models may also lead the way. For example, imagine an automotive business being able to give a detailed break-down regarding the carbon emission profile of all the myriad components that go into making a vehicle.

How can technology assurance impact businesses and specific industries?

Digital acceleration brings exciting opportunities to transform any business, but the need to ensure financial data and controls remains front and center. Against the backdrop of digital transformation, today’s companies are facing an evolving regulatory environment with increased oversight. For this reason, digital transformation is having a significant impact on how KPMG firms provide assurance using technology.
Continuing the cyber security theme, developing a strong cyber strategy often starts with looking at an organization’s processes, controls and partners. Audit committees looking to gain reassurance around cyber security and privacy protection will want to be sure that management has examined their processes from beginning to end, identified areas of potential vulnerability, and put in place plans for controls.

What are the potential risks?

While automation helps drive efficiencies in financial accounting, it also introduces new risks. Audit committees need to ensure that management has a solid understanding of how automation (such as the use of bots) are being used in the company and can recognize signs of potential tampering.

What is KPMG doing to enhance technology assurance services?

KPMG firms have invested in developing tools to automate and drive value to our audits by using data analytics, robotic automation and artificial intelligence. Around this, we have established a global methodology focusing on delivering assurance over emerging technologies.
As such, we have incorporated our AI/ML experience, tools and methodologies, as well as our multidisciplinary capabilities around governance and risk management into a globally consistent approach. We provide independent assurance where permissible and approved on specific algorithms with our technical deep dive and review, showing whether it’s reliable, explainable and ethically responsible. Our own use of AI in audit supports our ability to bring trust and quality to the use of AI.

With change comes challenge

There’s no doubt that while digital transformation brings many opportunities, driving efficiencies and competitive advantage, it also exposes companies to new risks and threats. Technology assurance can build confidence in new and exciting technologies.
Throughout the All eyes on campaign, we’ll be sharing more from various global leaders on topics including AI, big data and continuous auditing.

In its recent report on the prudential treatment of sustainability risks within Solvency II, EIOPA recommended
opens in a new tab
that insurers holding equities and bonds in the fossil fuel sector should face additional capital charges. This is a significant milestone in the debate on how to reflect climate change in capital requirements for financial institutions.

The proposals

For equities, EIOPA recommends the introduction of a supplementary capital requirement of up to 17% in additive terms. EIOPA's impact assessment showed that this measure would only have a limited impact on insurers due to their low exposures to directly held fossil-fuel related stocks (comprising, on average, one per cent of insurers' total investments). 
For bonds, EIOPA recommends a supplementary capital charge of up to 40% in multiplicative terms. This would maintain the Standard Formula's duration-rating-based mapping of capital charges, again with limited impact due to insurers' low exposures to bonds held directly in the fossil fuel sector. 
EIOPA has begun to consider how climate-adaptation measures could reduce capital held for premium risk, and the appropriate prudential treatment for social risks. However, there is insufficient data in either area to draw conclusions, and therefore EIOPA will conduct further analysis.

Implications: balance sheets, spillover and divergence

Additional capital charges on fossil fuel assets will likely be interpreted by insurers as a 'brown penalising' measure, forcing firms to consider divesting their holdings and reconsider their investment strategies. If adopted, insurers will need to assess how the additional capital charges affect their solvency ratios. Although EIOPA asserts that the impact will be limited, insurers' own assessments may be different.  Additionally, those firms with internal models will want to understand how any Standard Formula changes could affect how they design, calibrate and change their models in future. 
Firms will also be keen to see if there is any jurisdiction spillover. Currently, EIOPA's proposals represent divergence between the UK and EU. Where EIOPA has recommended capital charges for climate-related market risks, the PRA does not mandate any specific climate capital charges for insurers or banks. Instead, it expects firms to make their own assessments on their climate-related exposures and evidence how their capital levels are sufficient to manage these risks. This may change as the UK regulator consults on updates to Supervisory Statement (SS) 3/19 in Q1 2025 and as part of any future review of the Standard Formula within Solvency UK, but all messaging to date suggests that this is unlikely and that the PRA will probably continue to follow a principles-based approach. At a global level, the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) has identified climate change as one of its three strategic themes for the next four years, and insurers will be keen to see how it approaches the subject of capital requirements.  
Other non-insurance FS-firms will also be monitoring how the European Commission responds to EIOPA's recommendations. If adopted, there will be questions around whether the other European Supervisory Authorities, the EBA and ESMA, could take a similar approach in due course for banks and investment firms. There will also be concerns around how EIOPA's proposals might impact economic growth. This is currently a major political drive in the European Union and will likely be a factor in the Commission's assessment of the proposals. 
EIOPA's recommendations are not final policy. The Commission will need to consider the proposals and then decide whether to adopt them. There are currently no indications of when this could happen.

How KPMG in the UK can help

KPMG in the UK has a dedicated Advisory practice with extensive climate risk management experience. We can support financial institutions in addressing the business and regulatory challenges of climate change and sustainability, applying our experience, our understanding of industry and evolving regulatory expectations, and our combined skills across different markets and risk types.

Hot on the heels of her first Budget, Rachel Reeves has delivered her first Mansion House speech
opens in a new tab
as Chancellor of the Exchequer.
Mansion House speeches are watched closely, as they indicate the Chancellor's priorities for the financial services industry. This is particularly the case in the first term of a new government and a raft of policy documents were published following the speech.
The speech signalled more than ever that the government is seeking to balance regulators' existing remits with the goal of driving growth in financial services and, in turn, the real economy. 
The accompanying policy package is reminiscent of prior attempts to invigorate the sector, such as the previous government's Edinburgh Reforms. On FS regulation, the measures announced largely progress and build on policy already under way, with the notable exceptions of the joint review of the redress system by the FCA and FOS, and new policy proposals to consolidate and scale pension schemes. 
There is emphasis on reducing regulatory burden, although this is targeted rather than representing a dramatic ripping up of red tape. There is also an emphasis on `co-design' of policy with a focus on government working together with industry and across regulators, which will be welcomed by financial services firms.
It remains to be seen how quickly the reforms can be delivered and how effective they will be in practice.

Driving growth and competitiveness in the sector

The Chancellor remarked that the `UK has been regulating for risk, but not regulating for growth.' Therefore, while not ignoring the regulators' primary objectives, HM Treasury's (HMT) remit letters to the regulators ask them to consider how to enable `informed and responsible risk-taking' by authorised firms and customers. HMT also emphasises the need to accelerate the adoption and embedding of the secondary international competitiveness and growth objective. To help raise UK productivity, HMT is keen to ensure that regulators support innovative new firms to enter the market, and to enable existing firms to innovate and invest in new technologies. HMT also wants firms to have positive experiences engaging with regulators with administrative burdens streamlined as far as possible.

“The UK has been regulating for risk, but not regulating for growth. So while maintaining important consumer protections, upholding international standards of regulation and protecting the vital stability of our financial services system, now is also the moment to rebalance our approach and take forward the next stage of reforms needed to drive growth, competitiveness and investment.”

In Spring 2025, the government will publish the first ever `Financial Services Growth and Competitiveness Strategy' focusing on five priority growth opportunities - fintech, sustainable finance, asset management and wholesale services, insurance and reinsurance and capital markets (including retail investment). It will be underpinned by five core policy pillars - innovation & technology, regulatory environment, regional growth, skills & access to talent, international partnerships & trade. HMT has launched a Call for Evidence
opens in a new tab
to help inform this strategy.
As part of the government's effort to remove disproportionate regulatory burden, HMT, the FCA and the PRA will shortly publish the outcomes of the SMCR review including a commitment to consult on removing the current Certification Regime from legislation.

Putting pensions to work

As expected, the Chancellor's speech outlined plans for significant reforms of the UK pensions industry to address fragmentation, facilitate scale and improve governance, with the aim of unlocking increased private investment. Through the introduction of a Pensions Scheme Bill in 2026, the reforms would:
Create 'megafunds': this would be achieved by consolidating assets from 86 Local Government Pension Scheme (LGPS) authorities into eight pools. The new funds would need to be authorised by the FCA, their governance arrangements would be overhauled and an independent review process would be established to ensure each of the schemes' Administering Authorities are fit for purpose. A consultation
opens in a new tab
will run until 16 January 2025.
Consolidate multi-employer defined contribution schemes: the government is also consulting
opens in a new tab
on introducing minimum size thresholds for these schemes, new measures to facilitate consolidation into megafunds, and new legislation to allow fund managers to more easily move savers from underperforming schemes to ones delivering higher returns.
The Chancellor also used the speech to share the interim report
opens in a new tab
of the Pensions Investment Review, initially launched in July. Interim findings are presented for each of the four workstreams (scale and consolidation in the DC workplace market, LGPS, cost and value considerations in the DC market, and UK investment).

Greening the economy

The new government has committed to delivering a `world-leading sustainable finance framework', built in partnership with industry. This will include investment in clean energy projects through the new National Wealth Fund, coupled with significant private investment. 
In addition to the Climate Investment Fund Capital Market Mechanism launched on the London Stock Exchange (LSE) in early November, and in line with one of the key recommendations from the recently published Transition Finance Market Review, the government will co-launch the Transition Finance Council alongside the City of London Corporation.
The government is consulting
opens in a new tab
until 6 February on the case for a UK Green Taxonomy. This is a consultation on the potential value, key design features and challenges to usability of a UK Taxonomy, not, at this stage, on specific activity-level standards, or on wider UK climate and environmental strategies. This could be viewed as something of a backward step, considering work done already by the Green Technical Advisory Group (GTAG) under the auspices of the Green Finance Institute. However, firms may welcome a sense-check now, given they are already under pressure from existing sustainability reporting and disclosure requirements and that the EU Taxonomy, on which the UK Taxonomy was likely to be modelled, has not been without problems.
The government has also published a consultation response and draft legislation
opens in a new tab
to bring ESG ratings providers into regulation. A new chapter, `15F' is added to amend the Regulated Activities Order (RAO) in respect of the definition and scope of ESG Ratings activity.
Other sustainability-driven initiatives will include:
The launch of a set of integrity principles for voluntary carbon and nature markets on 15 November at COP29, followed by a consultation in 2025.
The intention to consult on streamlined sustainability disclosures for economically significant companies. 
A consultation in the first half of 2025 on how best to take forward the manifesto commitment on transition plans.

Capital Markets

Various measures will be taken forward to promote innovation and reform aspects of the capital markets.
The Chancellor confirmed that the government will legislate to establish the Private Intermittent Securities and Capital Exchange System (PISCES) by May 2025 - an exchange designed to facilitate fundraising for private companies. Following consultation, the government has published feedback alongside its response
opens in a new tab
 (PDF 3443 KB), as well as draft legislation
opens in a new tab
 (PDF 469 KB) to establish the PISCES sandbox and an accompanying policy note
opens in a new tab
 (PDF 167 KB). Industry can feed back on the draft legislation until 9 January 2025. The Chancellor announced the launch of a parallel pilot to issue gilts using distributed ledger technology in the form of the Digital Gilt Instrument (DIGIT).
The government also plans
opens in a new tab
to legislate to give the FCA fuller powers of direction in relation to the reporting of OTC positions to increase transparency - allowing the market and the FCA to manage better market volatility such as the Nickel event in March 2022. HMT will start the process of moving MiFIR/MiFID from legislation into the FCA rulebook, in particular the transaction reporting and organisational requirements. At the same time, the FCA has launched a wide-ranging discussion paper
opens in a new tab
 (PDF 1414 KB) on the future of the transaction reporting regime. It is seeking feedback on where the regime could be simplified along with associated costs, the most burdensome aspects of the regime for firms, the scope of firms subject to the requirements and changes to improve the quality of reported data.

Payments

The Chancellor announced the publication of the National Payments Vision
opens in a new tab
, identifying that there needs to a clear, predictable and proportionate regulatory framework and resilience infrastructure. Three pillars will guide future activity - innovation, competition and security. The Payments Vision Delivery Committee has been established, chaired by HMT and with senior representatives from BoE, FCA and PSR. The FCA welcomed
opens in a new tab
the Vision, noting that it shares the vision of an innovative, safe and competitive payments sector.

Banking

The Chancellor alluded to the Basel 3.1 and SDDT capital regime announcements from September 2024 as `the final stage of our post-crisis reforms to banks' capital requirements', noting that this marked `the end of the journey to ensure that banks are well-capitalised'. She called out the benefits of strengthening the resilience of the banking system whilst protecting banks' ability to lend to small and medium enterprises, referencing actions already taken by the PRA to support competitiveness.
Further actions were announced to support the mutuals, cooperatives and credit unions. The government has written to both the PRA and FCA requesting an assessment
opens in a new tab
of the current mutuals landscape by the end of 2025, to inform government and regulators' consideration of how best to support the sector to drive inclusive growth across the UK, including effective and proportionate regulation. It has also launched a call for evidence
opens in a new tab
on whether there is a case to change parts of the common bond requirement for credit unions, to better support their sustainable growth.

Insurance

The Chancellor highlighted insurance markets' pivotal role in driving growth. To support this, the government is consulting
opens in a new tab
on a new approach to captive insurance companies (vehicles for self-insuring risk from companies within the same group), again continuing to progress policy commitments made by the previous government. 
The consultation will be welcomed by insurers and corporates as a step towards levelling the regulatory playing field with jurisdictions that have established themselves as hubs for captives. It is high level and does not set out specific policy proposals. Instead, it seeks views on the merits of establishing a dedicated captives regime, its potential scope and exclusions, and the applicable regulatory framework (conduct and prudential) and regulatory approach to captive managers.
In addition, the PRA has released a consultation
opens in a new tab
on Insurance Special Purpose (ISP) vehicles, aiming to speed up the regulatory approvals for new catastrophe bond applications from 4-6 weeks to 10 days (as previously signalled by the PRA).
In a separate announcement the day after the Mansion House speech, the PRA concluded its Solvency II review process and published
opens in a new tab
the final package of rules and policy materials that will replace Solvency II assimilated law.

Advice Guidance Boundary Review

The Chancellor acknowledged the ongoing challenges associated with the advice gap and signalled that the FCA will propose `transformational changes'. An FCA discussion paper
opens in a new tab
 sets out the approach and covers the three key components making up the advice guidance boundary review:
Clarification of the existing boundary between advice and guidance to give greater certainty to firms. The FCA has tried this type of clarification before with limited success, so it will be interesting to see if this can help firms get closer to supporting customers without straying into advice. 
Proposals for a simplified advice regime offering personal recommendations for straightforward needs. Again, this has had a lukewarm response when suggested previously. 
Creation of a new 'targeted support' regime - arguably the most transformational component. This will enable firms to proactively and holistically provide specific interventions to improve consumer support and aid customer understanding.
The proposed changes, which will be consulted on in due course, will help consumers make more informed decisions, leading to better pension outcomes. They will also help firms realise the, as yet, uncrystallised commercial opportunities generated by the Consumer Duty. However, a balance needs to be struck between good firm and good customer outcomes, therefore oversight and governance will play a critical role. The targeted support proposal, due in December, will be initially limited to pensions but a consultation on investments will follow in Spring 2025.

Redress

Given recent media coverage on the topic of consumer redress, firms may be interested to note that the Chancellor signalled reforms in this area, including a new agreement between the FCA and the FOS on how they cooperate in practice. 
The FCA and FOS have also launched a Call for Input
opens in a new tab
to understand how the redress framework could be modernised to better serve consumers and to provide greater stability for firms to invest and innovate - particularly in the context of `mass redress' events where many customers complain about the same issue. In addition to inviting views on modernisation, the authorities want to understand better the issues caused by mass redress events, where the framework could be improved to enable these events to be better identified and managed, and whether changes could help bring about more consistency in the FCA and FOS's views on regulatory requirements. The Memorandum of Understanding
opens in a new tab
between the two has also been updated to improve how they work together on important issues.

Trade in financial services

There were no noteworthy announcements regarding ambitions around market access for UK financial services firms. However, the Chancellor noted that she will be guided by the principle of free trade, including with the US and the EU. On the latter, she restated that Brexit will not be reversed but emphasised the need to `reset' the relationship. She also called for engagement with wider economies such as India, China and the Gulf states to realise new opportunities.

https://kpmg.com/xx/en/our-insights/regulatory-insights/the-uk-digital-securities-sandbox-is-open.html,Regulatory Insights,The UK Digital Securities Sandbox is open,,"NOVEMBER 2024

At the end of September, the Bank of England (BoE) and Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) opened the Digital Securities Sandbox (DSS) — the UK equivalent of the EU DLT Pilot regime. The DSS will facilitate the use of developing technology, such as DLT, in the issuance, trading and settlement of securities by allowing firms to operate under a temporarily modified legal and regulatory framework. Specifically, the sandbox will allow entrants to undertake the notary, maintenance and settlement activities traditionally associated with central securities depositories (CSDs) and combine these activities with the operation of a trading venue. The sandbox's opening comes after consultation with industry closed in May 2024. 
Some changes have been made to the original proposal - including allowing non-GBP denominated assets and reducing the minimum capital requirement. However, stablecoins and e-money are still unable to be used as settlement assets, due to financial stability concerns. The application form itself is supplemented by a full policy statement (PS24/12) and final guidance.
The DSS is expected to eventually feed into wider ongoing DLT initiatives — e.g. unified ledgers or the regulated liabilities network — that seek to combine tokenised central bank money, tokenised deposits and other tokenised assets on one platform. Such initiatives integrate developments in both the public and private sector to experiment with bringing more of the financial services ecosystem `on chain'.

Background

The DSS is the first Financial Market Infrastructure (FMI) sandbox created under powers conferred on HM Treasury (HMT) by the Financial Services and Markets Act (FSMA) 2023. FMI sandboxes allow firms to experiment with new or different practices and developing technology in the execution of their key functions. As the first FMI sandbox, the DSS will also become a test-case for this new form of policymaking, where regulators can observe activity in a controlled environment and consider whether changes to rules or legislation are required to enable it.
The DSS will allow sandbox entrants to undertake the notary, maintenance and settlement activities traditionally associated with CSDs and combine these activities with the operation of a trading venue. DSS activity will be `live' and the regulators' intention is that the wider financial ecosystem should be able to interact with a sandbox entrant in broadly the same way they would with a traditional FMI.
To protect financial stability however, limits will be placed on the value of securities issued into the DSS.
The DSS is, by its nature, a temporary regime. However, the powers in FSMA 2023 allow the government to legislate using secondary legislation to put in place a permanent regime, after reporting to Parliament. A smooth transition should be available for successful sandbox entrants into any new permanent regime introduced when the DSS closes.
The opening of the DSS (which has been accompanied by a full policy statement (PS24/12

), additional DSS guidance
opens in a new tab
and the application form
opens in a new tab
) follows the earlier consultation paper
opens in a new tab
that was published in April 2024. Respondents generally welcomed the regulators' initial proposals.

The DSS' twin initiative in the EU - known as the DLT pilot regime
opens in a new tab
 opened for applications in March 2023. However, so far, this regime has struggled to stimulate interest - see more in our previous article here.

Stages for a sandbox entrant

The DSS is divided into a series of gates for entrants to move through, providing a path to progress from one stage to the next. The level of permitted activity increases with each stage.

Digital security eligibility

Examples of what could be issued and traded in the DSS:
equities
corporate and government bonds
money market instruments such as commercial paper and certificates of deposits
units in collective investment undertakings (fund units)
emissions allowances
NB: before HMT's initial consultation made clear that cryptoassets which do not qualify as financial instruments under the RAO (i.e., unbacked cryptoassets or stablecoins) are out of the scope of the DSS and on this basis they do not qualify as FMI sandbox instruments. Moreover, such cryptoassets would also not be appropriate as a settlement asset on financial stability grounds.

Application eligibility

The DSS is open to firms of all sizes and at all stages of development as long as they are legally established in the UK. This could be an existing financial institution that is already authorised or recognised under current regulation or a new entrant to the market.

Fees

The BoE/FCA has proposed a `pay as you go' fee regime. This includes a £10,000 fee payable on application, a £40,000 fee payable on successfully passing through Gate 2 and regular fees to be paid annually during participation in the DSS, estimated at £85,000. The BoE/FCA has also proposed that fees should be additive for hybrid firms that will also require FCA authorisation in the normal way as outside the DSS.

What does this mean for firms?

DLT represents the possibility for vast efficiency gains within financial services — through cryptographically-secure record keeping and smart contract automation. However, traditional financial market infrastructure and regulation has evolved to require separate entities to perform different operational functions. This means that the full advantages of operating on a shared ledger cannot be met.
The UK's DSS (as well as the EU's DLTR) represent an opportunity to begin unlocking those advantages. In particular, the regimes could lead to faster and cheaper ways for securities to trade, settle, and be utilised among financial market participants. Moreover, this work could also ultimately fold into wider initiatives such as the Regulated Liabilities Network or the BIS' unified ledger — which aim to combine tokenised central bank money, tokenised deposits and other tokenised assets on one platform. (Read more in our article here). 
However, it seems regulators may have further to go in order to entice firms to innovate in these sandboxes rather than in their own walled gardens  - see more in our previous article here. And, regardless of where experimentation takes place, certain challenges persist, including:
Benefits cannot be achieved in a silo and rely on all stakeholders in the ecosystem operating together 'on chain'. Currently, market interest in the DSS seems hindered by the lack of `on chain' settlement options. UK regulators have acknowledged that wholesale central bank digital currency is under development but could be several years before deployment.
Transitioning from complex and embedded legacy systems onto DLT infrastructure is a delicate and complex process, involving effort and expense.
Interoperability (between DLT and non-DLT solutions, and between different types of DLT solutions) must be ensured, so as to avoid fragmentation of the trade-settlement process.

Next steps and how KPMG in the UK can help

The DSS will now be operational until December 2028 but can be extended by the government. The window for applying to join the DSS is expected to close around March 2027, so that the regulators and firms inside the DSS can prepare for a transition to a possible new permanent regime, provided the new technologies are implemented successfully. In the short term, UK regulators plan to arrange roundtables to discuss significant legal and policy issues within the DSS.
KPMG in the UK can support firms with various forms of experimentation — in particular, through the KPMG global network, KPMG professionals have access to KPMG in Germany's experience supporting the first German DLT pilot regime application. Our services include:
Strategy and business case development, assessing the feasibility of pilot regime/sandbox applications.
Development of technical requirements for priority use cases, process design and mapping.

https://kpmg.com/xx/en/our-insights/regulatory-insights/pra-areas-of-focus-for-climate-risk.html,Regulatory Insights,PRA Dear CFO letter on climate risk,,"October 2024
On 27 September, the PRA wrote to CFOs to share thematic feedback on firms’ abilities to quantify the impact of climate risk on their expected credit losses (ECL). While firms continue to make progress in developing their climate risk modelling capabilities, the PRA noted many areas where they could improve the identification and assessment of drivers of climate risk, expand the scope of portfolios assessed for climate risk and include horizon scanning in their climate risk assessments.
The PRA expects firms to act on the feedback and has asked auditors to review progress in addressing the areas of focus in the next round of written auditor reporting.

Overview

In 2023, the PRA set out areas of focus for climate risk and asked auditors for their views on the progress made by firms against them, including:
Identifying climate-related risk drivers that could influence ECL for loan portfolios with the highest sensitivity to climate risks.
Use of quantitative analysis on the impact of climate-related risk drivers on ECL and significant increase in credit risk (SICR) at a portfolio level.
Identifying how economic scenarios and weightings used for ECL calculations should be adapted to incorporate climate-related risk drivers.
The Dear CFO letter sets out the PRA’s thematic findings on each of these topics, based on auditor reports published in 2024, discussions with auditors and firms, and other thematic work.

Thematic findings

The most significant findings relate to:

1. Identifying climate-related risk drivers that could influence ECL for loan portfolios with the highest sensitivity to climate risks

The PRA acknowledges that identifying the loan portfolios and segments that will be most impacted by climate change is a challenge, with firms focusing on physical risks against property and the impact of carbon prices on corporate loans.
Examples of better practice seen across the industry in identifying climate-related risk drivers include expanding the scope of portfolios assessed for risk drivers (e.g. unsecured lending) and the scope of risk drivers considered at a product level (supply chain, litigation, refinancing).
Opportunities for improvement are to expand coverage of portfolios assessed for climate risk drivers, perform more detailed ""bottom-up"" assessments to identify sub-portfolio specific risk drivers and consider the impact of refinancing risk for higher-risk portfolios. The PRA notes that many firms assume a static balance approach in their climate risk assessments and ignore refinancing risk, with better practice being to include product-level reviews of refinancing risk across both retail and wholesale, considering such impacts as flood risk or regulatory changes on borrower’s ability to refinance.

2. Use of quantitative analysis on the impact of climate-related risk drivers on ECL and significant increase in credit risk (SICR) at a portfolio level

Firms are making progress in analysing the impact of climate-related risks on ECL. However, the use of these analyses to adjust reported ECL is limited. The PRA observed a range of practice including using analysis tools developed for stress testing to allow granular loan-level assessments of climate risk on probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD) and credit grades, measuring the impact of specific risk drivers on ECL for key portfolios, and considering the impact of physical and transition risks on PD as well as LGD. However, the PRA also noted that many firms continued to rely on expert judgement in their quantitative analysis and that less advanced approaches used simplistic metrics to assess the impact and ECL qualitatively. In addition, some risk drivers, such as supply chain or refinancing risk, remain a challenge for quantitative assessment.

3. Identifying how economic scenarios and weightings used for ECL calculations should be adapted to incorporate climate-related risk drivers

Examples of good practice observed by the PRA include the use of more disruptive downside climate scenarios and incorporating climate-adjusted forecasts of the macro-economic variables used in their existing IFRS9 models. Some firms have also introduced new climate-sensitive variables, such as carbon pricing, into their ECL models in order to capture climate risk. While some firms are benchmarking their macroeconomic variables against external climate scenarios (e.g. from the NGFS) the PRA has also cautioned that too much reliance on high-level benchmarking of macroeconomic variables may fail to identify borrowers or sectors that will be more affected by climate risks than the wider economy.

Areas of focus

The PRA has identified several key near- and medium-term areas of focus on climate risk for 2025. In the near term, firms should challenge the completeness of the climate-related risk drivers used to identify potential ECL impacts and the portfolios most at risk. In their quantitative models, firms should:
Address the risk that loan losses may exceed those predicted by current models.
Enhance analytical tools to ensure any conclusions on PMAs are driven by more robust and data-driven quantitative analysis.
Increase the focus on more granular portfolio level assessments.
Embed further the impact of climate risks into BAU credit risk assessments for corporate exposures.
Consider how BAU credit risk assessments can be subject to appropriate levels of challenge.

Finally, firms should consider a broader range of downside climate scenarios and climate-related variables in the economic scenarios used in the ECL calculation. This will allow for timely identification of borrowers and sectors more exposed to climate risk than the wider economy.
Over the medium-term, firms should focus on:
Identifying the requirement for data and models, and implementing the changes necessary, to factor climate-related risk drivers into loan level ECL estimates.
To enhance review and monitoring by second line risk teams of how models and scenarios used to calculate ECL incorporate climate-related risk drivers.

What firms should be doing next?

With the publication of the Dear CFO letter, the PRA has signalled that climate risk and scenario analysis will be receiving greater attention from the regulator in 2025. Firms should be:
Reviewing and validating existing models to ensure that they capture the material drivers of climate risk, can be used to assess the impacts of climate change under a range of short-, medium-, and long-term scenarios, and that they are sufficiently granular to produce informative and actionable information on risk.
Enhancing climate risk models so that they can provide robust, quantitative scenario analysis that will drive business strategy and incorporate firms lending strategy and risk appetite.
Embedding climate risk into their BAU processes, including credit scoring, counterparty risk assessment, and provisioning.

KPMG climate risk specialists would be happy to explore the next steps in more detail with you.

An aspect that holds great potential is how AI can help organizations boost their cybersecurity culture.

Cyber Human Risk Management (HRM) is essential to cybersecurity culture, as the way people manage technology is the window through which threat actors can infiltrate organizations.
In all organizations, but particularly ones with diverse ways of working across geographies, building a comprehensive and sustained cybersecurity culture can be challenging. Cybersecurity culture complexities can include how to overcome change resistance, how to adopt emerging technologies securely without slowing down innovation, how to manage interconnected systems securely, how to make the most of metrics and measurement, and more.
KPMG, along with Cybersecurity at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Sloan (CAMS), part of Sloan Management School Cybersecurity Research Division, set out to gain a better understanding of cybersecurity culture, its challenges, and how AI could make an impact. 
Read the full survey findings to learn how AI can impact cybersecurity culture.

Key themes

Secure behaviors
Fostering a cybersecurity culture – the values, attitudes and beliefs at leadership, group and individual levels across the enterprise - is key to managing cyber risk and driving secure behaviors.
Current state of maturity
With five levels of cybersecurity culture maturity, the organizations surveyed for this report are early in their cybersecurity journey and more so when it comes to using AI to support it.
Confronting cyber culture challenges
Organizations are facing a variety of challenges on the way to building a robust cybersecurity culture. Of these challenges, four overarching themes can be seen: the human behavior factor, emerging technologies, interconnected systems and measuring culture.

How can AI help boost cyber culture?

Fostering a strong cybersecurity culture across enterprises and broader ecosystems clearly has its challenges. And, it’s only getting more challenging. AI supports can help an organization building a strong cybersecurity culture through five key themes – visibility, efficiency, quantification, personalization and scalability.

AI in action

Scenario: CISO Yuki, as she prepares her annual budget, asks her Cyber HRM Director for help to refine the organization’s awareness and training strategy and include KPIs for board-level reporting.
AI use case: Using AI, the HRM Director aggregates data from internal and external sources to deliver a targeted risk analysis, tailored training and awareness strategy, and a scorecard that links cyber initiatives to business outcomes.
Benefits: This AI-driven approach equips Yuki with clear, data-backed insights for resource allocation, while allowing the HRM Director to maintain operational focus.
Discover more practical scenarios to help you overcome common challenges when starting to use AI to improve your cybersecurity culture.

Seven considerations to transform your cyber culture

Build a stronger cybersecurity culture with the support of AI by considering the following:
1. Outline your aspirations: Understand your current cybersecurity culture and set goals and aspirations for where you want to be in the future.
2. Secure support and investment: Seek support from parts of the organization that already have capabilities to develop and embed AI across functions.
3. Explore and experiment: Identify the gaps in your current capabilities and explore options for using AI through the definition of use cases.
4. Prioritize and implement: Focus on implementing the AI use cases that can have the most impact to driving a stronger cybersecurity culture and reducing risk.
5. Collect and measure what matters: An upfront focus on data and its quality can help you get the best out of your AI use cases, and avoid accuracy impacts of your AI models.
6. Be mindful of new risks: Consider what the AI tools and technologies can and can’t do, and the risks that come with them.
7. Prioritize the employee change journey: Prioritize employee wellbeing throughout change with the right communications, training and recognition.

A new age of cybersecurity culture

Drawing on the findings of this new research of cybersecurity leaders, subject matter experts and cross-industry executives, we explore how to harness AI to promote secure workplace behaviors.

As the business world evolves, companies may face additional challenges when accounting for more complex transactions and uncertainties. Accounting for provisions is one such area that has prompted the following long-standing questions. 
How do you determine if a present obligation exists and when do you recognise a provision?
Which costs do you include in measuring a provision?
Which discount rate do you use in discounting a long-term provision? 
In response, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) is proposing to clarify the related requirements in IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets and withdraw related interpretations, including IFRIC 21 Levies. The proposals may result in larger provisions at an earlier date.

When do you recognise a provision?

One of the challenging questions in applying IAS 37 is when to recognise a provision, specifically how a company determines if it has a present obligation and what a ‘past event’ is. These questions became more prominent with the rise of climate-related commitments and threshold-based obligations. 
In response, proposals to amend IAS 37 include:
three new tests to determine whether a present obligation exists; and 
specific guidance for threshold-based obligations.
What does this mean for companies? The impacts of these changes could be significant for some depending on the nature of their obligations and their existing accounting policies. 
Under the proposals, companies may need to start recognising some provisions sooner if they expect to exceed a specific threshold. This would require management to make new judgements.

Which costs do you include in measuring a provision?

IAS 37 provides no specific guidance on which costs to include in measuring a provision. Therefore, companies’ approaches vary depending on the nature of the provision and their accounting policy.
The IASB proposes to include all direct costs in measuring any type of provision. This may result in some provisions becoming larger. 
For example, a company may currently recognise a provision for a legal claim based on incremental costs only. Under the proposals, the company would need to include all direct costs, such as the internal legal team payroll and an allocation of other costs.

Which discount rate do you use when discounting a long-term provision?

In applying IAS 37, the approach to determining the discount rate for long-term provisions varies between companies – i.e. some use a risk-free rate; others adjust the rate for non-performance or their own credit risk. 
The IASB proposes to use a risk-free discount rate in measuring a long-term provision. Depending on the company’s current accounting policy, some provisions may become larger.

What’s next?

Read the proposals and use our guide to help you understand the potential changes and their impact on your company’s provisions. Get involved and submit your comments to the IASB by 12 March 2025.

https://kpmg.com/xx/en/our-insights/regulatory-insights/cryptoasset-risk.html,Regulatory Insights,Cryptoasset risk,,"Over the past few months, there have been significant updates to the UK's proposed approach to the regulation of crypto-assets. The government has now formally launched its plan to make the UK a 'crypto hub' — a move which was preceded by coordinated publications from financial regulators, signalling their increased focus on firms' management of crypto services and exposures.

In its March 2022 Financial Stability in Focus report
opens in a new tab
, the Bank of England's (BoE's) Financial Policy Committee judged that direct risks to stability of the UK financial system from crypto and decentralised finance (DeFi) are currently limited. However, the report noted that, if the pace of growth continues, and as these assets become more interconnected with the wider financial system, they will begin to present a larger risk.
The report was published on the same day that the PRA wrote

 (PDF 364KB) to bank and investment firm CEOs setting out its expectations around exposures to cryptoassets and the BoE issued a summary 
opens in a new tab
of responses to its Discussion Paper on New Forms of Digital Money. In addition, the FCA issued a notice 
opens in a new tab
to all regulated firms reminding them of their existing obligations when interacting with or exposed to cryptoassets and related services.

Adapting risk frameworks

The PRA's letter considers how the prudential framework should be applied to ensure that firms engaging in crypto activity manage the associated risks in a way that supports safety and soundness.
Firms are expected to consider whether they are adequately capturing the characteristics of these largely new and untested markets in their risk frameworks. Methodologies and calibrations will likely need to be adjusted in the longer term, but the PRA considers that a combination of strong risk controls, operational risk assessments, robust new product approval processes, Pillar 1, Pillar 2, and ongoing monitoring arrangements of strong risk controls can provide an appropriate interim approach:
Strong risk controls
Crypto risks should be considered fully by the board and highest levels of executive management
An individual approved by the PRA to perform an appropriate Senior Management Function should be actively involved in signing-off the risk assessment framework for any planned exposure to cryptoassets
Financial, prudential, operational, and reputational frameworks may need adjustment to reflect crypto activity risks e.g. via increased monitoring, updated modelling, lower risk tolerances, and / or increased use of stress tests
Firms should consider the full prudential framework when assessing cryptoasset risks, including the Fundamental Rules, Pillar 1, the ICAAP and related Pillar 2 considerations
Pillar 1
The PRA recognises that the measures in the PRA Rulebook and CRR are not well calibrated to the risks of crypto assets — this is being considered. Firms should be alert to specific risks related to crypto activities e.g. market, counterparty credit or operational risk and consider them under the Pillar 1 framework
In many cases, direct holding of cryptoassets will be classified as an intangible asset under applicable accounting frameworks. In most cases, under the CRR, this is likely to result in a full deduction of any direct holdings from CET1
Under market risk rules, where there are no other appropriate treatments, an appropriate capital requirement would be 100% of the current value of the firm's position, particularly for unbacked crypto. In estimating exposures, diversification and hedging frameworks should be conservative. Firms may also wish to look to existing structures, such as the commodity framework, to inform appropriate risk management techniques.
Firms should consider whether the standardised approach to counterparty credit risk (SA-CCR) captures the full risks associated with many cryptoassets
Pillar 2
Firms should set out their risk considerations relating to crypto-exposures in their ICAAP
Depending on activities, they should separately assess their activities for at least market risk, credit risk, counterparty credit risk and operational risk
They should also consider the extent to which they are exposed to risks not generally considered in their existing Pillar 2 assessment  — these could include operational risks (such as fraud, cyber or outsourcing risk) which are heightened through exposure to certain crypto-related activities
The Basel Committee and other international bodies are yet to complete their work on the risks of cryptoassets, however the PRA wants firms with relevant exposures to understand current expectations in respect of the existing prudential framework. As international discussions progress, these expectations may evolve and potentially become more stringent. The long-term prudential treatment of crypto-assets is therefore likely to differ from that under the current framework.
The PRA will continue to monitor any expansion of firms' crypto-related activities and will consult where further changes to the regulatory framework are required. It has also launched a survey of firms covering existing crypto exposures and future plans for 2022. Firms are asked to submit their responses by 3 June 2022.

Obligations for firms 
The FCA's notice reminds all regulated firms of their existing obligations when interacting with or exposed to cryptoassets and related services, including that:
Firms must ensure consumers understand the extent of regulated versus unregulated business 
Firms carrying out cryptoasset activity in the UK must comply with the 2017 AML CFT regulations which include the requirement to be registered with the FCA. As part of this, firms should be reviewing whether crypto businesses they interact with are listed on the FCA's Unregistered Cryptoasset Businesses page
Firms subject to the FCA's investment firm prudential regime (IFPR), have obligations (under MIFIDPRU 7) to assess and mitigate the potential for harm that could arise from all of their business (including crypto). Other firms should consider this guidance when assessing and managing risks and exposures from cryptoassets. Where a firm accounts for a cryptoasset as an intangible asset, it will likely need to deduct this asset from its regulatory capital
When considering custody arrangements, all FCA-regulated firms must observe the relevant Principles for Business (PDF 216KB)
Where cryptoassets are specified investments (i.e. security tokens), firms carrying out regulated activities involving custody of these assets are likely to need to comply with the requirements of the CASS regime
The FCA will continue to work closely with international (IOSCO, FSB, FATF) and domestic partners, through the revived Crypto-asset Taskforce, to continue progressing effective regulation and common standards.

New forms of digital money 
The BoE's summary of responses to the Discussion Paper (DP) sets out its emerging thoughts on how new forms of digital money (including both systemic stablecoins and a UK Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC)) might affect the financial system and the economy. This DP built on the BoE's previous DP on a CBDC, published in March 2020, and the FPC's expectations for systemic stablecoins set out in the December 2019 Financial Stability Report. (PDF 7.57MB)

While the BoE has not yet decided how to proceed on any of the topics covered in the DP, the feedback received has shown strong support for it to continue its work. That said, respondents were clear about three things:
Access to cash should be preserved
The BoE should continue to engage with stakeholders including the wider public
Any regulation for systemic stablecoins should be clear, proportionate and risk-based

Looking ahead 
In April, the UK government announced its plan

 to make the UK a 'global cryptoasset technology hub' by:

Holding a two day 'CryptoSprint' in May, led by the FCA and with industry participants, to seek views directly from industry on key issues relating to the development of a future cryptoasset regime such as disclosure requirements around issuance of cryptoassets and the custody regulatory framework
Working with the Royal Mint on a Non-Fungible Token (NFT)
Establishing a Cryptoasset Engagement Group to work more closely with industry
Exploring ways of enhancing the competitiveness of the UK tax system to encourage further development of the cryptoasset market
As part of the same package of announcements, John Glen (Economic Secretary to the Treasury) also confirmed

 that the government will consult on wider regulation of the cryptoasset sector later in 2022.

Our insights

https://kpmg.com/xx/en/our-insights/regulatory-insights/basel-reforms.html,Regulatory Insights,Basel Reforms,,"On 24 March, the European Central Bank (ECB) issued an opinion on the European Commission's October 2021 proposal for amendments to the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR3). The amended CRR will implement the remaining Basel reforms in the EU.

The opinion broadly welcomes the Commission's proposals, which implement the Basel reforms, reinforce the EU Single Rulebook and enhance the prudential framework for credit institutions in various areas.

The ECB reiterates earlier statements on the importance of finalising the EU implementation of the final Basel reforms in a “timely, full and faithful manner”, in order to address shortcomings in the current framework swiftly and effectively, thereby ensuring that banks will continue to be resilient to future crises. And it notes that a full and faithful implementation is important, not only for financial stability, but for the international credibility of the EU.

Pockets of risk

It is the issue of full and faithful implementation that troubles the ECB. It expresses concern that some deviations and implementation choices in the European Commission proposal may leave pockets of risk insufficiently addressed in the banking sector. The main areas of risk, it notes, arise from the proposed prudential treatment of real estate exposures, credit risk from unrated corporates, counterparty credit risk, equity exposures, and operational risk.
The following areas are called out in detail:
Output floor — the proposal for the output floor (OF) includes significant transitional arrangements, leading to lower risk weights than those from the Basel standards in specific areas including residential real estate exposures with low historical losses, exposures to unrated corporates, and the calibration of counterparty credit risk related to derivative exposures.
The ECB supports the option for the “single stack” approach (a single capital stack for risk-based capital requirements) and the application of the OF at the highest level of consolidation. However, it disagrees with the re-distribution mechanism proposed by the European Commission. From the ECB's perspective, this mechanism may incentivise banking groups to reorganise their activities in order to minimise the impact of the OF on individual parts of the group. This could have a negative impact through the misalignment of organisational structures or sound risk management, and also freeze more capital at local level, which is contrary to the objective of free movement of capital necessary for financial integration.
Credit risk framework — the standardised approach contains several new deviations from the final Basel standards that, together with the continuation of some existing deviations (e.g. for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and infrastructure), may reduce the consistency and safety of the new standardised approach and leave certain risks uncovered.
The ECB suggests that co-legislators should also reassess the current deviations. It is particularly concerned with the impact of deviations regarding specialised lending exposures, equity exposures, retail exposures and the methodology for collateral valuation for exposures secured by immovable property.
Operational risk — the ECB expresses regret that the European Commission did not opt for recognition of historical losses for the calculation of capital requirements for operational risks. Inclusion of the loss history, it judges, would enhance risk-sensitivity and loss coverage of capital requirements, providing greater incentives for institutions to improve their operational risk management.
Market risk — the CRR3 proposal allows the European Commission to change the calibration of capital requirements under the new market risk framework and to postpone its implementation by two years. This could result in reduced capital requirements, deviating from the Basel standards. The ECB opinion recommends that these powers be limited, highlighting the importance of implementation by 2025.
Credit valuation adjustment (CVA) — the ECB highlights that the proposal does not reconsider existing exemptions and that such deviations are not justified from a prudential perspective, as they leave institutions exposed to uncovered risks from derivatives transactions with exempted counterparties.
Pillar III disclosures and reporting — the ECB considers that the small and non-complex institutions' (SNCIs') approach for quantitative disclosures (which uses supervisory reporting to compile the corresponding quantitative public disclosures on the basis of a pre-defined mapping) could be applied to all institutions, regardless of their size and complexity, to reduce the reporting burden of all institutions.

Implications

The ECB's opinion may lead to non-acceptance by the European Parliament of the European Commission's proposal. This would likely lead to further, extended discussions around which deviations from the Basel standards should or should not be implemented. Should these discussions be very protracted, it could call into question the feasibility of the proposed 1 January 2025 implementation start date or, at the least, reduce the amount of time available to banks to prepare for final implementation.

https://kpmg.com/xx/en/our-insights/regulatory-insights/regulatory-cooperation.html,Regulatory Insights,Regulatory Cooperation,,"The financial services landscape continues to undergo widespread digitalisation, marked by an influx of borderless and data-based products and services. The internet now theoretically allows firms to sell financial services to consumers anywhere in the world and this transformation has prompted regulators to ramp up efforts towards formalising co-operation — both across jurisdictions and across industries. As a result, firms should prepare themselves for increased guidance and regulatory expectations.
In response to the digitalisation of financial services, regulators have been looking to step up co-operation with their international counterparts and with bodies outside the industry's traditional perimeter (including competition authorities, consumer protection authorities, and data governance regulators). As things stand, such cooperation remains somewhat inhibited by practical, regulatory and legal challenges including data protection rules or a lack of information exchange structures.
In early 2022, the FSB published a report
opens in a new tab
 (PDF 567 KB) assessing the risks posed by the expanding crypto-asset market — noting, in particular, how the rapid evolution and international nature of these arrangements raises the potential for regulatory gaps, fragmentation or arbitrage. The FSB consequently urged global authorities to prioritise cross-border and cross-sectoral cooperation. It also described how it plans to support this work by monitoring supervisory approaches and facilitating information sharing.
In regards to cyber and digital resilience, the EU's Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) also requires an unprecedented level of cooperation between authorities. The European Commission proposed DORA as part of its wider digital finance package
opens in a new tab
 to harmonise the EU's currently disjointed regulatory landscape (where rules are often overlapping, inconsistent and/or duplicative). Recognising the fluidity of cyber threats, DORA intends to establish several mechanisms through which authorities will have to exchange information and work together, not only within the financial sector, but also with the cybersecurity authorities in the ecosystem.
Decentralised Finance (DeFi) is another focus area. In March, IOSCO published a report
opens in a new tab
 (PDF 959 KB) describing how the majority of DeFi's new services are emerging to replicate more traditional financial services and relevant activities, but with weaker regulation and increased risks for investors. At the BIS's recent Innovation Summit, Andrew Bailey (Governor of the Bank of England), stressed the need for international co-operation (particularly around the increasing use of artificial intelligence in DeFi) to prevent companies from using modern technology to circumvent national rules.
To address these (and similar) challenges, the three European Supervisory Authorities (EBA, EIOPA and ESMA) recently published a response
opens in a new tab
 (PDF 2.56 MB) to the European Commission's (EC) call for Advice on Digital Finance. Within this, they recommended improving international supervisory coordination by:
Producing additional guidance on notification requirements for cross-border provision — currently, passporting notifications are typically given on an EU-wide basis (rather than specific to the jurisdictions in which services are actually carried out) and have insufficient information regarding the modalities of provision (e.g., the use of digital platforms)
Enhancing cross-border information exchange — e.g., by establishing supervisory forums to discuss practical use cases (such as the allocation of responsibilities between home and host authorities, coordinating the collection of data etc)
Introducing processes and measures to address rule infringement
Enhancing coordination with third-country authorities in the form of a review of existing Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) to ensure they reflect specific issues related to digital finance
The ESAs also propose potential frameworks to introduce structured cooperation between financial, data, cyber, consumer protection and competition authorities. The report describes how this would be beneficial (i) to maintain awareness of policy developments happening across relevant sectors, (ii) to better identify and monitor market developments and emerging risks on a horizontal basis, and (iii) in the context of the growing platformisation of financial services and the development of mixed activity groups. [For more information, see our recent article

 on the expansion of Big Tech platforms into financial services]. Some initial improvements have already been seen as a result of the ESA's 2019 review, which resulted in a mandate for cooperation between the ESAs and the European Data Protection Board and a request for bilateral/multilateral information exchange between regulatory authorities. However, at the ESAs own admission, the steps taken remain limited in scope.

In April 2021, the FCA became

 a full member of the UK Digital Regulation Cooperation Forum (DRCF), having previously been an observer member — a move which demonstrates the growing importance of data across sectors and regulatory disciplines. The DRCF was established in July 2020 by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) and the Office of Communications (Ofcom), to ensure a greater level of cooperation over the regulation of online platforms. Its member regulators have committed to launching joint projects on “complex cross-cutting issues” including AI, digital advertising technologies and end-to-end encryption.
A few months later, the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy (BEIS) published its Spring 2021 report
opens in a new tab
 on the Smart Data Working Group. The report describes the potential benefits, challenges and use cases of Smart Data in banking, finance and other industries, and sets out practical proposals for cross-sector coordination to inform future policy development.
And finally, the Department for Digital, Media, Culture and Sport (DCMS) recently closed a consultation

 on the legislation and governance required to enable the use of digital identity across the economy — including in financial services. This consultation builds on previous government activity including a Call for Evidence

 in February 2021 (setting out what rules and standards are needed to protect sensitive identity data when used digitally).
Taken together, these developments demonstrate how, in response to increasing digitalisation, financial services regulators are seeking to establish 'more concrete' frameworks to structure cross-border and cross-industry co-operation. Firms should continue to track developments, in order to best prepare themselves for when these regulatory expectations become final.

https://kpmg.com/xx/en/our-insights/regulatory-insights/what-are-the-new-consumer-duty-requirement.html,Regulatory Insights,What are the new Consumer Duty requirements?,,"The Consumer Duty is a package of measures comprised of:
A new Consumer Principle (Principle 12) that provides a high-level expectation of conduct and associated outcomes.
A set of overarching cross-cutting rules which develop and amplify the standards of conduct that the FCA expects under the Consumer Principle.
The four outcomes, which are a suite of rules and guidance setting more detailed expectations for a firm's conduct according to the four specific outcomes that represent the key elements of the firm and its consumer relationships.

Consumer Duty and the FCA Handbook

The new principle, rules and guidance will sit within the High-Level Standards Principles (PRIN) sourcebook. The Consumer Principle will become Principle 12 with Principles 6 and 7 disapplied for retail business.
Scope — There is no overarching definition of `retail customer'. Instead, the FCA has chosen to align the scope of the Consumer Duty with the existing scope of the sectoral sourcebooks. For example, for investments, the scope of the Consumer Duty will follow the scope of the Conduct of Business Sourcebook (COBS).
SM&CR — FCA propose to amend the individual conduct rules in the Code of Conduct sourcebook (COCON) for the Senior Managers and Certification Regime (SM&CR) adding a new rule requiring all `conduct rules' staff within firms to `act to deliver good outcomes for retail customers' where their firms' activities fall within scope of the Consumer Duty. Where this new rule applies, the existing individual conduct rule 4 will be disapplied. 
For the FCA, this is a straightforward and simplified approach rather than seeking to fully integrate into existing handbooks with a significant volume of changes. All existing requirements will remain in place. The FCA has committed to use the implementation period to identify whether there are any areas of the Handbook that may require amendment, in light of the Consumer Duty. However, this may give firms insufficient time to respond effectively to any such changes — at least in the short-term.
However, for firms drawing a line between who qualifies as a retail customer in certain circumstances for certain products may not be straightforward. The FCA's expectation regarding insurers' responsibilities for assessing fair value for multi occupancy buildings insurance (summarised below) encapsulates this.

Case study: Consumer Duty scope
Definition of retail customer multi-occupancy buildings insurance
A recent Dear CEO letter to Insurers and brokers on approaches to insurance costs for multi-occupancy buildings demonstrates the processes the FCA expect firms to take when considering the line between retail customer and commercial customers.

The FCA highlight firms' responsibilities to take account of the freeholders duties to their leaseholders when determining 'fair value', what is in the best interests of customers and what meets their needs.

Although many freehold property owners will be commercial customers, consideration should be paid to the obligations they owe to their leaseholders who are likely to be retail consumers, as most leaseholders pay for buildings insurance through service charges and cannot shop around to find the best deals.

The Consumer Duty is underpinned by the concept of reasonableness. The FCA expect rules and guidance to be interpreted in line with the standard that could reasonably be expected of a prudent firm:
Carrying on the same activity in relation to the same product or service.
With the necessary understanding of the needs and characteristics of its customers.
Although the concept of reasonableness exists in current FCA requirements, the subjectivity of applying it to a broad range of interconnected aspects will prove a challenge for firms.

Cross-cutting rules
The cross-cutting rules strengthen the standards of conduct the FCA expect under the Consumer Principle. They develop the FCA's overarching objectives for firm behaviour through three common themes applying across all areas of a firm's conduct. They also intended to inform and help firms interpret the four outcomes.
The cross-cutting rules require firms to:
1. Act in good faith toward retail customers.
2. Avoid foreseeable harm to retail customers.
3. Enable and support retail customers to pursue their financial objectives.

The four outcomes
The four outcomes represent the key elements of the firm-customer relationship. The behaviour and actions of firms in relation to each of these outcomes are instrumental in enabling consumers to meet their financial needs and improve their financial wellbeing.
1. Products and services
2. Price and value
3. Consumer understanding
4. Consumer support
The outcomes establish the suite of rules and guidance setting the FCA's expectations of firms under the Consumer Duty, and whilst standalone, are unsurprisingly interlinked. For example, poor product design or governance may impact fair value considerations. Across all outcomes there is an expectation that:
Firms review their current approaches to bring them in line with the Consumer Duty requirements.
Firms ensure they can evidence outcomes.
Outcomes are reviewed and monitored on an ongoing basis.
Any issues identified are remedied or mitigated.

Governance and accountability
The FCA expects the focus on acting to deliver good outcomes will be at the heart of firms' strategy and business objectives. It expects firms to embed the duty in the same way, and receive the same level of ongoing attention, as they have with financial performance or risk.

Under the Consumer Duty, a firm's board or board equivalent, will be responsible for assessing whether it is delivering good outcomes for its customers which are consistent with the Consumer Duty. As such, firms will need to determine what type, frequency and level of granularity their board will need engage to be able to provide this assurance.

SM&CR will apply to the Consumer Duty as it does to other Principles and rules. The FCA doesn't want the responsibility for compliance with all elements of the Consumer Duty to apply to one individual. Instead, the responsibility should permeate throughout senior management and the design, distribution and delivery lifecycle. All senior managers are responsible for ensuring that the business of the firm complies with the requirements of the Consumer Duty on an ongoing basis. Therefore, the way firms design, implement, assess and monitor its solution to evidence outcomes will need to be a core focus of implementation activity at all levels of management.

This approach emphasises the fundamental change the FCA want to see with these measures — with a focus on delivering good consumer outcomes running through every action, fully embedded into every department and supported by robust evidence.

Our people",
https://kpmg.com/xx/en/our-insights/regulatory-insights/fca-supervisory-approach.html,Regulatory Insights,FCA Supervisory Approach,,"The FCA is seeking to embed an outcomes-focused approach to supervision whilst retaining aspects of a conduct-focused approach. Within this article, we explore how the regulator has evolved its approach and how it is likely to supervise firms under the Consumer Duty.
The FCA's approach will consider whether a firm has implemented and maintained an appropriate balance between its commercial interests and delivering good customer outcomes. The FCA's supervisors will assess whether the firm is culturally aligned to its customers and has an appropriate purpose and associated business model. The diagram illustrates the journey that the regulator (and firms) have been on and how the inroduction of a Consumer Duty willbe the final stage on the journey to outcomes-based regulation.

Over recent years, the FCA has developed a range of separate initiatives which, when assessed together, give the FCA a small but powerful range of supervisory tools to rapidly assess the degree to which each firm poses a risk to its consumer protection objective. The Consumer Duty will be an integral part of this regulatory toolkit.

This will allow the FCA to increase their focus on firms demonstrating the consumer outcomes they are delivering.

The FCA has made clear that the Consumer Duty fully aligns to its new transformation programme which aims to create a data-led, agile, assertive and innovative regulator. Although core supervision activities will remain, the FCA's supervisory approach will evolve. An outcomes-based approach will give it greater agility to be assertive and focus on practices that adversely affect consumer outcomes at an earlier stage whilst also supporting innovation in markets.
This change in focus will support the FCA to become more data-led, with the expectation it will be in a position to more quickly identify poor outcomes — and, before harm becomes widespread.

Case Study: Assertive and proactive regulation

Buy Now Pay Later Sector 
The FCA's statement
opens in a new tab
 confirming action undertaken in the Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) sector demonstrates its intention to be more agile and assertive in order to protect consumers from potential harm In advance of full FCA regulation of the BNPL market, the FCA took early action prompted by concerns of areas of potential customer detriment. Whilst not all BNPL products are regulated by the FCA , all firms must comply with consumer protection legislation.

Using their powers under the Consumer Rights Act 2015 (CRA), the FCA assessed the fairness and transparency of contract terms of four firms offering unregulated BNPL products. This action identified potential harm to consumers relating to contractual terms. As a result of FCA intervention the firms agreed to change these terms to make the contracts fairer, easier for consumers to understand and to reflect how they use them in practice.

The FCA also used this opportunity to remind all BNPL firms of their responsibility to ensure that their consumer contracts comply with all requirements of consumer protection legislation applicable to them, and provide guidance on regulatory expectations.

Whilst the elements above appear to work in concert, firms will need to reconcile how the Consumer Duty package of measures interact with other existing requirements (e.g. statutory duty-based expectations on firms, Treating Customers Fairly (TCF), client's best interest rules, as well as the duty of responsibility already on executives under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (FSMA)). It remains a challenge for the FCA to create a consistent approach without creating additional complexity. There are also significant elements of the proposed new framework that rely upon an assessment of reasonableness or require firms to exercise their judgement. Whilst this is to be expected, it can create fragmented outcomes and a lack of consistency across the sectors.

Although the FCA has stated that there is no intention for the Consumer Duty to be applied retrospectively, this will be of little comfort to any firm with any form of legacy or existing business as they have confirmed that the rules apply in relation to all existing products and services once the new rules come in. With the need to regularly review arrangements under the Consumer Duty, even existing business will become subject to these increased regulatory standards pertaining to communications, products and services, consumer understanding, consumer support and pricing and value. This could have a material impact on firms with a business model of maintaining or acquiring sizable back books of business.
The FCA's own transformations programme, towards an intelligence and data led regulatory approach, is underpinned by the Consumer Duty initiative. It will create an operating model which permits a significantly more effective and efficient supervision of firms allowing the FCA to achieve “more with less” . In speeches about their transformation, the FCA has highlighted that its own work programme stretches from fast-paced innovation driven by data science projects to strategic programmes that fundamentally re-imagines how it collects intelligence, analyse data, and takes action in a more joined up way.
The FCA's approach to monitoring is interesting and represents a material divergence from its traditional mandated regulatory reporting approach. Without being unduly prescriptive, the FCA is placing the accountability to firms for defining what good outcomes look like for them based upon their culture, strategy, business model, proposition and control environment. Once defined, firms will need to collect data, insights and management evidence to prove to the FCA the appropriateness and effectiveness of their approach. Firms will need to assess whether their existing Conduct Risk framework is sufficient to meet the expectations relating to Consumer Duty or if further development is required to introduce a greater emphasis on genuine consumer outcomes. However, crucially, based upon the FCA's future approach, the associated MI will need to be agile and readily configurable to meet FCA evolving data expectations.
Finally, the Consumer Duty structure and underlying rules and guidance and its position within the FCA's High Level Standards Principles (PRIN) sourcebook provides a simpler and more efficient mechanism by which to take enforcement action against firms that wilfully do not place customers at the heart of their business.
The FCA's direction of travel is clear and therefore there are steps that firms should take now on a no-regrets basis to ensure that they have developed business models, products and services, and supporting processes and procedures that provide due consideration to their customers. However, crucially, it will also require consideration of how firms can suitably demonstrate and evidence this to the FCA.

https://kpmg.com/xx/en/our-insights/regulatory-insights/fca-diversity-and-inclusion-on-company-boards-and-executive-management.html,Regulatory Insights,FCA — Diversity and inclusion (D&I) on company boards and executive management,,"On 20 April 2022, the FCA issued a Policy Statement on Diversity and inclusion on company boards and executive management
opens in a new tab
 (PDF 644KB). This introduces new Listing Rules to require issuers to include a statement in their annual financial report setting out on a “comply-or-explain” basis whether they have met specific board diversity targets. Corporate governance rules are also expanded to encourage issuers to consider broader aspects of diversity in their reporting on board diversity policies.
The new rules represent a significant step in expanding regulatory policy around Diversity and inclusion (D&I). It is the first time such targets have been set by the regulator and the requirement for disclosure in annual reports across the UK economy will bring the issue of board diversity to the fore.
The policy follows consultation
opens in a new tab
 from July to October 2021 and is the result of the FCA's focus on speeding up the pace of change around D&I in financial services. Through the new measures, the FCA aims to:
Improve transparency for investors and other market participants on the diversity of company boards and their executive management to increase engagement and inform investment decisions
Create a positive reporting benchmark to encourage progress (through the use of diversity targets on a ""comply or explain basis"") and broader scrutiny and consideration of diversity and inclusion both at senior level and throughout impacted companies
Improve considerations of broader diversity aspects within diversity policies and related disclosures
The FCA hopes that investor pressure will, in practice, encourage issuers towards greater diversity, with potential further benefits for corporate governance and decision-making.

Applicability and timeline

The new rules apply to UK and overseas issuers with equity shares, or certificates representing equity shares, which are standard or premium listed issuers (per the FCA's Official List
opens in a new tab
), excluding OEICs and `shell companies' but including closed-ended investment funds and sovereign controlled companies.
The rules will not apply to issuers of listed debt and debt-like securities, securitised derivatives or miscellaneous securities.
The corporate governance rules apply to certain UK issuers with securities admitted to UK regulated markets and, through the Listing Rules, to certain overseas listed companies subject to existing exemptions for small and medium companies.
In-scope companies are required to make disclosures in their annual reports for financial years starting on or after 1 April 2022.

New requirements

On a “comply-or-explain” basis, all in-scope issuers must add a statement to their annual financial report which sets out whether the following three targets have been met:
At least 40% of the board are women
At least one of the following senior board positions is staffed by a woman - Chair, Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Senior Independent Director (SID) or Chief Financial Officer (CFO)
At least one board member is from a minority ethnic background, defined by reference to the categories recommended by the Office for National Statistics, excluding those listed as coming from a White ethnic background
The statement should also set out the reference date used and any changes to the board that have occurred between the reference date and the date on which the annual financial report is approved that have affected the company's ability to meet one or more of the targets. Where the reference date is different to the date of publication of the statement, issuers must explain why.
Numerical disclosures are also required (using the standard format set out in Annex 2 of the Policy Statement) on:
Sex or gender identity and ethnic diversity of the board, senior board positions (Chair, CEO, SID and CFO) and other executive management
Issuers must also explain their approach to collecting data and maintain a consistent approach to doing so. Guidance is provided on how data may best be collected.

Additional disclosures encouraged

The Policy Statement also encourages issuers to disclose the following information to the extent that it provides further context:
A brief summary of any key policies, procedures and processes, and context which contribute to improving the diversity of the board and executive management
Mitigating factors or circumstances which make achieving board diversity more challenging (for example, the size of the board or the country where its main operations are located)
Any risks foreseen in being able to meet or continue to meet the board diversity targets in the next accounting period
Any plans to improve the diversity of the board

Measuring success and next steps

The FCA identifies the following measures of success:
The fullness and clarity of the data that the new measures generate. The FCA will assess whether the dataset being provided by in-scope companies is comparable and meaningful
Feedback from investors and other stakeholders about whether the data is useful. As part of this process, potential improvements will be considered
Over time, the FCA will assess whether the policy is making it easier for investors to compare issuers' board and executive management diversity as part of their investment and stewardship decisions and whether the data shows that diversity is increasing. Where issuers decide to publish numerical data on the diversity of their board and relevant board committees, this may inform further broadening of the scope of disclosure requirements.
Although the new policy is a significant step in encouraging firms to consider the diversity of their senior management, there is still room for further improvement, or a ramping up of the targets to be reported against. The FCA will review the policy in three years' time to consider whether the levels of targets remain appropriate and whether further targets for other aspects of diversity should be considered.

Broader work on D&I

Alongside this Policy Statement, the FCA has also been considering ways to improve diversity and inclusion in the financial services sector to advance its objectives of consumer protection, enhancing the integrity of the financial system and promoting effective competition.

The Discussion Paper 'Diversity & inclusion in the financial sector
opens in a new tab
' (PDF 829KB) was published jointly with the Bank of England and PRA in July 2021 and was the first step in setting out a new regulatory framework on diversity and inclusion. A follow-up consultation is expected in 2022 building on feedback to the DP, the D&I pilot data survey and the cost benefit analysis survey. Resulting proposals are expected to apply broadly across the financial sector so are likely to be relevant for all authorised financial services firms.

Financial resilience, operational risk and resilience and governance and risk management continue to be key themes alongside broader horizon scanning activities. The PRA recognises the material improvement in the overall resilience of the banking and insurance sectors and is now turning its attention to maintaining that improved level of resilience.
Following a strategic review in 2021, last year's eight strategic goals
opens in a new tab
 have been replaced with four strategic priorities (SPs):
Retain and build on the strength of the banking and insurance sectors delivered by the financial crisis reforms
Be at the forefront of identifying new and emerging risks, and developing international policy
Support competitive and dynamic markets in the sectors that the PRA regulates
Run an inclusive, efficient, and modern regulator within the central bank
The SPs have been introduced to reflect the changing regulatory and external environment, for example the greater post-Brexit rule-making role that the government has proposed for the PRA as part of the future regulatory framework review (FRF), and the need to keep pace with innovation and emerging risks. Key areas of focus include the ongoing digitalisation of financial services and the growth of crypto assets, the increasing use of artificial intelligence and machine learning, developments in FinTech and the management of risks to firms' safety and soundness from climate change. Unsurprisingly, the conflict in Ukraine has led the PRA to reprioritise some work to ensure the safety and soundness of regulated firms whilst also continuing to progress its business as usual work plan.

Budget 
The PRA's budget will increase by 8% to £320.9m in 2022/2023, driven by the increase in its responsibilities following the UK's withdrawal from the EU, together with the priorities of operational and cyber resilience, and developments in its data analytics and technology capability. It is looking to hire 100 more staff in the supervisory risk specialist, policy and data science divisions.
For more on relevant areas impacting regulated firms, see below:

SP1 — Retain and build on the strength of the banking and insurance sectors delivered by the financial crisis reforms 
Under the first strategic priority, the PRA considers the financial resilience of banks and insurers, operational resilience and governance:

SP2 — Be at the forefront of identifying new and emerging risks, and developing international policy 
The second strategic priority sets out areas where the PRA will focus its attention in order to respond to external events and future risks. It also covers the PRA's international engagement in order to shaping regulatory policy on a wider stage:

SP3 — Support competitive and dynamic markets in regulated sectors 
The third strategic priority considers ways in which the PRA can advance its primary and secondary objectives through regulation — this includes taking advantage of the opportunities to tailor regulation to the needs of the UK market which may result from the FRF review.

opens in a new tab
 for FMIs, which also came into effect from March 2022.
FMIs should consider the proposals in the CPs to determine additional actions they may need to take around third party relationships and how these might impact their business models.

Regulatory concerns around outsourcing and third party risk management in FMIs

FMIs have become increasingly reliant on third party technology as a means of entering new markets, lowering operating costs and keeping pace with the digital economy. This includes cloud outsourcing which can provide the underlying infrastructure supporting many other solutions.
Despite the potential benefits, the complexity of third party relationships gives regulators cause for concern in a number of areas:
Third party provision can make it difficult for FMI senior management to monitor relevant risks. This can be amplified when the third parties engage in sub-outsourcing — outsourcing elements of their contracted services to other third parties.
There are risks around vendor lock-in — when FMIs' or FMI participants' have limited ability to exit arrangements without substantial cost or disruption.
Moreover, if a large number of FMIs become dependent on a small number of dominant and non-substitutable third-parties, this could give rise to systemic concentration risks. The BoE, PRA and FCA's forthcoming joint Discussion Paper on Critical Third Parties will consider which third parties may be a source of systemic risk to UK financial stability.
There is also growing regulatory interest around participant outsourcing arrangements — where FMI participants outsource their connectivity to FMIs to the cloud. This can create indirect dependencies on critical service providers (CSPs), with which an FMI may have a separate relationship and, by extension, concentration risk on a single provider at both the FMI and systemic levels.

The BoE's approach
The majority of the proposals in the three CPs focus on how FMIs can address outsourcing and third party risks. The scope includes third parties involved in both outsourced and non-outsourced arrangements.
Each CP includes:
Expectations for the pre-outsourcing phase relating to criticality assessments, risk assessments, notification requirements and due diligence processes.
The requirement for a formalised contractual agreement to be in place for all outsourcing arrangements, irrespective of criticality, and including intragroup arrangements.
Additional requirements for critical outsourcing arrangements such as written agreements relating to:
data security
access, audit, and information rights
sub-outsourcing
business continuity and exit strategies
A requirement that an FMI remains responsible if a third party on whom it relies to provide an important business service fails to remain within impact tolerances or causes the FMI itself to fail to do so.
The CPs also invite industry feedback on systemic concentration risks and how these could be better assessed and managed both domestically and internationally.
The proposals supplement the requirements issued for the same FMIs back in March 2021, when the BoE published its final policy on the Operational Resilience of FMIs
opens in a new tab
. This set out expectations for firms and FMIs to:
Identify their important business services by considering how disruption to the business services they provide can have impacts beyond their own commercial interests.
Set a tolerance for disruption for each important business services (an `impact tolerance').

International consistency
The BoE proposes to define third parties as organisations that have entered into relationships with an FMI to provide products, services, processes, activities or business functions. This is consistent with the definition used by the G7 and other international supervisory authorities.
Other supervisory authorities around the world are also updating their expectations on outsourcing and third party risk management as financial services providers become increasingly dependent on interconnected third parties. The BoE's work therefore takes account of:

CJEU decides in Dutch net taxation case

CJEU – The Netherlands – Withholding tax on dividends – Net taxation – Free movement of capital

On November 7, 2024, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU or the Court) rendered its decision
opens in a new tab
 in case C-782/22. 
Case XX C-782/22 concerns a UK-based life insurance company that received dividend income from passive investments in the Netherlands and suffered Dutch withholding tax on the gross dividend income. The Dutch dividends were received as part of unit linked products that were offered to UK pension schemes. These dividends were subject to 15 percent Dutch dividend withholding tax, which was a final tax for non-residents. The plaintiff was represented by KPMG.
For Dutch taxpayers, the withholding tax represents a pre-payment of corporate income tax that can be fully offset against the corporate income tax due. Where the corporate income tax due is lower than the dividend tax already levied, the taxpayer receives a refund of the difference. For Dutch entities that operate a comparable business model as the plaintiff in the case at hand, the effective tax burden on such dividends is zero. This is due to an offset against the dividend income of an equal amount representing the corresponding increase of the provision for obligations to the policy holders, which reduces the tax base for Dutch corporate income tax purposes to zero. For Dutch taxpayers, the dividend withholding tax is as a result effectively fully refunded.
The CJEU held that the different treatment in the Netherlands of resident and non-resident companies constitutes an unjustified restriction of the EU free movement of capital if there is a direct link between the dividends received on the one hand and the increase in the obligations to unit linked policy holders on the other hand. The question whether such direct link exists must be answered by the national court. Different from what the Dutch tax authorities argued, the 2015 CJEU judgment C-17/14 does not apply in the presence of such a direct link. That judgment only allowed a deduction of the costs connected to the collection of the dividend income.

Background

On December 14, 2022 the Dutch of Court of Appeal (ECLI:NL:GHSHE:2022:4471) referred preliminary questions to the CJEU concerning the interpretation of, in particular, the CJEU’s judgment in case C-17/14 of September 17, 2015 (ECLI:EU:C:2015:608) and whether this applies in general to all cases where a non-resident receives dividend income from another member state (which is the view of the Dutch tax authorities).
Case C-17/14 dealt with the so-called “net taxation” issue, which, in essence, deals with the difference in treatment between resident taxpayers subject to tax on a net basis (i.e., income less expenses), and non-resident taxpayers that are subject to withholding tax on a gross basis (i.e., the income is taxed in full, with no possibility to deduct related expenses). Based on settled EU case law, a non-resident should not be treated less favorably (i.e., subject to a higher level of taxation) than a resident taxpayer in a comparable situation, unless the difference in treatment is justified by an overriding reason in the public interest. The result of applying this general principle to a “net taxation” case is that, in calculating the tax base, a non-resident is entitled to claim a deduction from its gross revenues of directly related expenses.
Case C-17/14 dealt with a very specific “net taxation” situation, whereby a French bank received dividend income from the Netherlands which was subject to a 15 percent Dutch dividend withholding tax. In its judgment, the CJEU ruled that – in order to level the playing field with comparable resident entities – the French bank was only entitled to a deduction of the costs that related to the collection of the dividends but not to other directly related expenses.
The Dutch tax authorities interpreted the CJEU’s judgment in the C-17/14 case as meaning that the UK-based life insurance company was not entitled to a deduction of amounts representing the increases of the provision for obligations to the policy holders corresponding to the dividend income received.
The UK life insurance company challenged this assessment and argued in front of the Dutch Court that the facts in C-17/14 are fundamentally different compared to the case at hand and that for that reason the CJEU’s judgment in that case is not relevant here. The fundamental difference between the two fact patterns is that – in the case of the UK insurance company offering unit-linked products, the dividend income was critical to its business model and it service offering to its clients, whereas that seems to have been different in case C-17/14 case. Given this difference, the CJEU’s judgment in that case should not be the principal basis for resolving the dispute in the case at hand, which should rather be decided upon in light of previous CJEU judgements on “net taxation” that refer to the deductibility of expenses directly related to the income derived from the Netherlands.

CJEU decision

The CJEU ruled that the costs incurred as a result of an increase in the company's future payment obligations – which results in a deduction when calculating taxable income for a comparable resident unit linked insurance company – should be taken into account when determining the taxable base of a non-resident unit linked insurance company. In other words, a non-resident company should have the same effective tax burden on the Dutch source dividends as a company that is a resident of the Netherlands.
The CJEU referred to its previous case law in noting that resident and non-residents are in a comparable situation as regards costs, such as business expenses directly linked to an activity which has generated taxable income, and that a direct link exists where costs are incurred due to that activity, which are therefore necessary for carrying out that activity. Although the CJEU recalled its decision in case C-17/14 (among others) in noting that in the case of dividend specifically such a link exists only if those costs are directly linked to the collection as such of the dividends. It further noted that it cannot be held on the basis of that decision alone that the situations of residents and non-residents receiving dividends are not comparable in the light of the Dutch legislation at issue.
The CJEU referred instead to its judgment of November 13, 2019, in case C-641/17 (EU:C:2019:960) and emphasizes that this judgement is ruled after the date of case C-17/14 of September 17, 2015. The CJEU held, in essence, in case C-641/17 that a non-resident pension fund that uses dividends received to contribute to the provisions of the pensions it will have to pay in the future, is in a comparable situation to a resident pension fund which increases future liabilities based on the same mechanics. Furthermore, the CJEU pointed out in that decision that the receipt of dividends led to a proportional increase in the technical provisions and therefore that there was a direct link between the receipt of dividends and the corresponding increase in those technical reserves. It is important to note in this context, that all pension funds are in principle required by law to invest insurance premiums received on the capital market in order to generate income in the form of dividends enabling them to meet their future obligations under insurance contracts. In that respect, resident and non-resident pension funds are comparable, according to the CJEU.
In the case of the UK unit linked insurance company, the Dutch referring court observed that, although the company is not a pension fund, its activity nevertheless consists of investing sums of money, including in Dutch shares, to cover its obligations towards its clients under unit-linked contracts, and that the investment results lead to a corresponding change in the financial obligation towards its clients (and therefore in an increase in the related technical reserves).
The referring Dutch court also considers that there is a direct causal link between investment results and changes in the company’s liabilities and that, precisely as a result of that link, a Dutch tax resident company does not pay Dutch corporate income tax on those dividends (since there is an economic link between those dividends and changes in the amount of its liabilities to clients).
The CJEU concluded that, if it appears that under Dutch domestic law such a direct link exists between the dividends received by resident companies and the change in their obligations towards clients, a non-resident company is objectively comparable to a resident company. It is up to the national court to ascertain these facts and to determine whether under (Dutch) domestic tax law the objective is to effectively exempt these dividends from corporate income tax (see CJEU November 8, 2012, C-342/10, EU:C:2012: 688, paragraph 42). If the referring court considers that a non-resident company is in a situation objectively comparable to that of a resident company, and that the disputed Dutch legislation represents a restriction of the EU free movement of capital, it must be further examined whether the difference in treatment may be justified by overriding reasons in the public interest. The CJEU assessed whether the restriction may be justified by the need for a balanced allocation of taxing rights and the need to preserve the coherence of the tax system and dismissed their validity as possible justifications.

ETC Comment

The CJEU’s decision is a welcome clarification of the narrow application of its previous decision in case C-17/14. On the contrary, the CJEU equated the fact pattern in the case at hand with that dealt with in case C-641/17 and therefore acknowledged that the dividend income received by the plaintiff in relation to its unit-linked business is critical to the business model of the plaintiff and its service offering to its clients. The referring Dutch court observed that, although the company is not a pension fund, its business model and the resulting implications with respect to its the financial obligation towards its clients are equivalent. Furthermore, the referring court also noted a direct causal link between investment results and changes in the company’s liabilities. It may be inferred from these assessments that, light of the CJEU’s decision, it is likely that the referring court will confirm the unjustified difference in treatment.
This judgment is not only relevant for insurance companies with unit linked service offerings, but potentially also for other non-resident (life) insurance companies and pension funds deriving dividend income from another member state. This is not necessarily restricted to EU resident investors only.

https://kpmg.com/xx/en/our-insights/regulatory-insights/pra-completing-the-simpler-regime.html,Regulatory Insights,PRA CP 7/24 – Completing the Simpler regime,,"September 2024

Alongside the second package (PS9/24
opens in a new tab
) of ‘near-final’ rules for the UK implementation of Basel 3.1, the PRA has published a consultation (CP7/24
opens in a new tab
) on capital proposals for Small Domestic Deposit Takers (SDDTs) and SDDT consolidation entities. These proposals are the final component of the ‘Simpler Regime’ first outlined in Sam Woods’ November 2020 Mansion House speech. They will be of particular interest to firms already registered as SDDTs, firms that meet the SDDT criteria and are considering registering as an SDDT, firms that anticipate being subject to the Interim Capital Regime (ICR) and entities that do business with SDDTs.
The PRA finalised the eligibility criteria for SDDT firms and the non-capital related elements (i.e. liquidity and disclosure requirements) of the proposed prudential framework in PS15/23
opens in a new tab
. In this new consultation, it sets out proposals for the capital-related elements of the regime and offers additional liquidity simplifications for SDDTs.

Overview

In line with responses to Discussion Paper (DP) 1/21
opens in a new tab
, the PRA has followed a “streamlined approach”, aiming to simplify current prudential requirements rather than creating a new and bespoke prudential framework for SDDTs that is significantly different from the one that applies to other firms.
Most importantly, CP7/24 confirms that Basel 3.1 risk weights should be used as the starting point for the Pillar 1 framework for SDDTs, subject to a small number of simplifications. Phil Evans, PRA Director of Prudential Policy, notes in his accompanying speech
opens in a new tab
that “if Basel 3.1 is our best estimate of the risk weights, then that is going to be true whether large firms or small firms are doing the activity”.
However, the PRA also proposes widespread simplification of all elements of the capital stack for SDDTs including Pillar 1, Pillar 2A, buffers and the calculation of regulatory capital.
The overall capital requirements for SDDTs are expected to remain similar under the new system, to maintain their resilience against shocks. The PRA’s intention was never to dramatically reduce the amount of capital required, but rather to focus on minimising the operational burden for smaller firms. Following one-off implementation costs, the extensive simplifications should result in lower reporting requirements and the ability to hold lower management buffers.
CP7/24 clarifies that the SDDT regime operates on an opt-in basis. It also sets out the proposed revocation of the Interim Capital Regime (ICR) from 1 January 2027 – at this point, firms opted into it the ICR would be required to implement either the full Basel 3.1 standards or the simplified SDDT capital regime. 
The consultation closes on 12 December 2024 with implementation proposed from 1 January 2027.

In more detail

The most significant announcements relate to:
1. Leveraging Basel 3.1 risk weights
The PRA proposes to base the Pillar 1 framework for SDDTs on the Basel 3.1 standardised approaches (SAs) to credit risk and operational risk as set out in PS9/24 and PS17/23 respectively. 
From an ideological standpoint, the PRA maintains that risk weights should remain consistent regardless of whether large firms or small firms are doing the activity – “the risk is the risk”.
This approach offers a significant advantage in that there will be no difference in risk weights for firms seeking to transition in or out of the SDDT regime.
2. Simplification of the capital stack
The PRA proposes to:
Simplify the Pillar 1 framework for SDDTs through the disapplication of the due diligence requirements in the standardised approach to credit risk (CR SA), simplifications to the market risk framework, the disapplication of capital requirements for counterparty credit risk for derivatives (with some minor exceptions) and credit valuation adjustment (CVA) risk, and consequential changes to the Leverage Ratio and Large Exposures rules.
Simplify the Pillar 2A methodologies for credit risk, credit concentration risk, and operational risk.
Introduce a new Single Capital Buffer (SCB) framework to replace the current buffers framework (consisting of the Capital Conservation Buffer (CCoB) and Countercyclical Capital Buffer (CCyB), which together make up the combined buffer, and the PRA buffer), and the removal of automatic capital conservation measures under the maximum distributable amount (MDA) framework.
Replace the current cyclical stress testing framework with a non-cyclical framework.
Remove the CCyB adjustment between buffers and Pillar 2A to make the capital stack much simpler for SDDTs to understand.
Simplify the Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment process (ICAAP) and a reduction in the frequency of the Internal Liquidity Adequacy Assessment Process review (ILAAP).
Simplify certain complex capital deduction rules.
Simplify reporting requirements, in line with the proposals set out above.
As noted above, the overall capital requirements for SDDTs are expected to be similar to the current system under the new regime. However, after consideration of one-off implementation costs, there would be a range of benefits from the proposed simplifications including:
More constant and predictable capital requirements –this would improve challenges that small firms currently face in raising new regulatory capital quickly in response to changes in regulatory buffers – as there may not be a deep market for their capital instruments always available, or their access to external funding opportunities are limited.
Lower costs due to reduced reporting requirements and a simpler supervisory process.
3. Clarification of opt-in basis
The CP clarifies that the SDDT regime operates exclusively on an opt-in basis. Firms meeting the SDDT criteria (SDDT-eligible firms) can enter the regime by consenting to a Modification by Consent (MbC). 
4. Revocation of the ICR
The ICR is an optional and temporary regime that offers SDDT-eligible firms the choice to remain subject to the existing CRR capital provisions until the SDDT capital regime is implemented. This avoids the need for firms to implement the full suite of Basel 3.1 standards before subsequently moving over to the new regime.
The ICR is intended to be in place only between the implementation date for Basel 3.1 (1 January 2026) and the proposed implementation date for the SDDT capital regime (1 January 2027). At the end of this period, CP7/24 proposes that the ICR would cease to apply and the rules that give it effect would be revoked. 
ICR firms that have taken up SDDT MbC would immediately move onto the simplified capital regime for SDDTs, while ICR firms that have not taken up the SDDT MbC would move onto full Basel 3.1 standards.
Note for clarification: In CP16/22 (November 2022), the ICR was referred to as the Transitional Capital Regime (TCR). The TCR was renamed as the ICR in Section 8 of PS17/23 (December 2023) and an accompanying Statement of Policy

Recap – SDDT scope criteria
Maximum size threshold of £20 billion – based on average of assets over past 36 months.
At least 85% of a firm’s credit exposures must be to obligors located in the UK. Average of exposures over past 36 months.
UK exposures must remain above 75% at all times.
Exposures that are residential loans to individuals, secured on UK land and buildings may be treated as exposures located in the UK for the purpose of determining whether a firm meets this criterion.
A firm must have an on- and off- balance sheet trading business that would be equal to, or less than, both £44 million and 5% of the firm’s total assets. The criterion is met unless a firm has been above one or both of thresholds for more than three months in succession OR six months in the past year.
The sum of a firm’s overall net foreign exchange position must be equal to or less than 2% of the firm’s own funds. A firm meets this criterion unless it has been above the threshold for more than three months in succession OR six months in the past year.
A firm must not hold any positions in commodities and commodity derivatives.
A firm must not breach a ceiling equal to 3.5% of the firm’s own funds.
A firm must not use an IRB model for credit risk.
A firm must not provide clearing, settlement, custody or correspondent banking services. A firm may provide these services to another entity within its own group in Pound Sterling (GBP).
A firm must not operate a payment system.
Any parent of the firm must be a UK entity.
The criteria must also be met in respect of the CRR consolidation entity on a consolidated basis, and in respect of each UK bank and building society in the consolidation group.

https://kpmg.com/xx/en/our-insights/regulatory-insights/basel-3-1-near-final-rules.html,Regulatory Insights,Basel 3.1 – PRA PS 9/24,,"September 2024
The PRA has published the second part (PS9/24
opens in a new tab
) of its package of ‘near-final’ rules for the UK implementation of Basel 3.1 covering credit risk, the output floor and disclosure requirements. Part 1 (PS17/23
opens in a new tab
) was issued in December 2023, covering market risk, credit valuation adjustment risk, counterparty credit risk and operational risk. Both policy statements address the proposals put forward in CP16/22
opens in a new tab
in November 2022.
Only minor changes were made in PS17/23. However, in PS9/24, having received the greatest volume of feedback on the proposals for credit risk and the output floor, the PRA makes more significant amendments. In doing so, it has sought to balance the feedback from industry with its aim of close alignment with the Basel standards, its views on the bottom-up risks and its secondary objective of competitiveness. Phil Evans, PRA Director of Prudential Policy, notes in his accompanying speech
opens in a new tab
that the goal is for banks to hold “an appropriate amount of capital” – enough to be resilient but not so much that it stifles growth.

Overview

The key amendments in PS9/24 relate to SME and infrastructure lending, conversion factors (CFs), residential mortgages and the output floor. PS9/24 also links to the Strong and Simple regime for Small Domestic Deposit Takers (SDDTs). The PRA has published a separate consultation (CP7/24
opens in a new tab
) on the capital elements of this regime. 
Critically, PS9/24 also confirms that the UK implementation timeline will now run from 1 January 2026, with a transitional period to 1 January 2030. This will allow firms more time to apply the requirements and finalise model permission applications but is a slight compression of the transition period which was previously four and a half years. UK implementation will now lag the main EU implementation by a full year – there is a specific carve-out for the EU market risk implementation to start on 1 January 2026.
The US position is less clear. The US Basel 3 Endgame is expected to be re-proposed and to feature broad and material changes
opens in a new tab
, which will undoubtedly have implications for the timeline. Banks operating across the three jurisdictions will have to continue to manage these conflicting schedules.
Overall, the UK Basel 3.1 package remains highly aligned with the Basel standards. Whilst this second PS clearly includes measures to support UK competitiveness, in the main these are introduced as additions rather than modifications to the standards.
In the case of CFs, the PRA has specifically targeted international competitiveness. The reduction in CF for transaction-related contingent items brings the UK in line with the EU. The reduction in CF for “other commitments” brings it in line with the Basel text, where previously the UK was super-equivalent.
The PRA considers that the original aggregated cost-benefit analysis in CP16/22 remains “appropriate” and that the adjustments will not significantly increase costs for firms. It estimates that the impact of the changes will be less than 1% in aggregate on capital requirements phased in over the four years, i.e., lower than the impact of the proposals in CP16/22 and in other jurisdictions due, in part, to some of the risks that will now be addressed in Pillar 1 capital requirements previously being captured elsewhere in the UK’s Pillar 2 framework.

'Near-final' rules

As with the first package, the PRA’s rules are marked ‘near-final’ because of the requirement for some retained EU rules to be revoked before they can be fully implemented. Banks should not anticipate any significant modifications going forward. The PRA intends to set out all the final policy materials, rules and technical standards covered by PS9/24 and in PS17/23 in a single, final PS in due course.

In more detail

The most significant announcements relate to:
1. SME lending 
Noting the importance of SME lending for growth, the PRA has made amendments to reduce the operational burden for firms and lower capital requirements.
Although the PRA has not gone quite as far as some might have liked, with the near-final rules still removing the favourable “supporting factor” inherited from the EU, there are additional changes to limit the impact, including:
A new firm-specific structural adjustment to Pillar 2A (the ‘SME lending adjustment’), to ensure that the removal of the SME supporting factor under Pillar 1 does not result in an increase in overall capital requirements for these exposures. More details on the implementation of this will be available “in due course”.
A new, simplified definition of SME to reduce the operational burden for firms applying the definition and broaden the scope of exposures which qualify for preferential treatment as an SME.
Removal of the requirement that SA risk weights for commercial real estate (CRE) exposures should be no lower than 100% for exposures where repayment is not materially dependent on cashflows from the property, resulting in lower risk weights.
Infrastructure lending
The near-final rules remove another inherited EU “supporting factor”, relating to infrastructure lending. Potential capital increases will be mitigated through:
A new lower risk weight of 50% (70% in CP16/22) for “substantially stronger” project finance exposures under the IRB slotting approach. For higher quality lending, the new risk weight represents a reduction that is greater than the original supporting factor being removed.
Another firm-specific structural adjustment to Pillar 2A (the ‘infrastructure lending adjustment’) to ensure that the removal of the infrastructure support factor under Pillar 1 does not result in an increase in overall capital requirements for infrastructure exposures.
Lower, more risk-sensitive CFs for off-balance sheet items
The near-final rules adjust CFs as follows to “benefit international competitiveness”:
Lowering the CF for ”transaction-related contingent items” from 50% in CP16/22 to 20% , bringing the UK in line with the EU
Lowering the CF for “other commitments” (except for UK residential mortgage commitments) from 50% to 40%.  This brings the PRA rules in line with the Basel text, whereas previously they were super-equivalent.
2. Residential mortgages
The near-final rules introduce a more risk-sensitive and operationally simpler approach to the valuation of residential real estate under the credit risk standardised approach (SA), including:
Addition of a ‘backstop’ revaluation event requiring firms to obtain a new valuation once every three or five years (depending on the property), to prevent products without natural refinancing events, such as lifetime mortgages, from being unjustifiably disadvantaged.
Removal of the requirement for firms to adjust a valuation to reflect the value of the property that would be sustainable over the life of the loan.
Clarification regarding downward revaluation requirements, making them more mechanistic, and therefore simpler, by requiring firms to revalue properties if they estimate through their regular monitoring that the market value of the property has decreased by more than 10% relative to the value recorded at the last valuation event.
3. Calculating the output floor
The proposals in CP16/22 prioritised simplicity, requiring no additional work from IRB firms to adjust their capital resources to reflect differences in the treatment of provisions in the standardised and IRB approaches. However, feedback noted that in some cases the floor would be a less accurate measure of required capital. The near-final rules now introduce an adjustment to risk weighted assets to reflect the different treatment of accounting provisions under the SA and the IRB approaches.
4. Clarification on use of Automatic Valuation Models (AVMs)
The near-final rules also clarify that the use of AVMs for the desk-based generation of house valuations is permitted. With the industry relying significantly on automated valuation methodologies to support operational efficiency in the real estate lending business, banks will welcome the PRA clarification that they can be used.

https://kpmg.com/xx/en/our-insights/risk-and-regulation/building-unshakable-trust.html,Risk and Regulation,Building unshakable trust,,"Reputation risk has been around since commerce first began. It’s likely that we can all think of an organization whose long-established reputation was damaged by a single event or a sequence of events (either within or outside of their control).
For example, there have been many examples of firms’ reputations being damaged by clumsy marketing campaigns or poorly performing products and services, but these are rarely fatal. BP and Exxon’s reputations were severely damaged by environmental disasters, but they survived. However, the collapse of Enron also brought down their auditor Arthur Andersen, primarily because their reputation was damaged beyond repair.
Reputation itself is a critical asset, often considered intangible but having a significant impact on an organization’s success. It influences stakeholder decisions, affects customer loyalty, and can drive or hinder business growth.
In the modern dynamic world in which organizations operate, the range of reputational risks has increased, especially from emerging technologies or from external ‘bad actors’. This is exemplified by The World Economic Forum’s Global Risks Perception Survey 2023-2024
opens in a new tab
, which lists both AI and cyber-related threats in the top five material risks to organizations.
This article explores more fully where reputational risks may come from and, importantly, how to build a model for building reputation resilience across your organization, including how you might go about building quantitative measures that track your progress.

Guarding against reputational threats: The blueprint for a robust reputation management

The potential impact of reputation risk

Reputation risk is the potential for negative publicity that can have profound and far-reaching consequences for organizations. Financially, they can lead to decreased sales, stock price declines and higher operational costs (as companies may need to invest in damage control efforts or face legal penalties). Customer trust and loyalty can be severely compromised, leading to long-term erosion of the customer base and market share.
Additionally, reputational damage can strain relationships with key stakeholders such as investors, regulators and partners, potentially resulting in the loss of investment, increased scrutiny and disrupted business operations. In severe cases, reputation risks can trigger leadership changes, employee dissatisfaction, and talent retention challenges, as well as affect future growth prospects.
Reputation risk can arise from various sources, including unethical behavior, governance failures, operational disruptions, product recalls or environmental incidents. Unlike other types of risk, reputation risk is often interconnected with other risks, amplifying their impact.
Ultimately, reputation risks, if not effectively managed, can undermine the organization’s overall competitiveness and sustainability in the market.

The need for reputation resilience

An organization’s ability to maintain and protect its reputation despite facing crises, challenges or changes in the external environment is known as reputation resilience.
Reputation resilience involves the capacity to anticipate potential threats to reputation, respond effectively during a crisis, and recover or even strengthen reputation post-crisis. Reputation resilience combines proactive measures, effective crisis management and long-term strategies to ensure that the organization can withstand and adapt to reputation-related challenges.
To build reputation resilience, a reputation management framework is desirable.

Reputation management framework

A reputation management framework is a structured approach to systematically manage, protect and enhance an organization’s reputation. It integrates various strategies, processes and tools to ensure that reputation is maintained as a key strategic asset.
The framework typically includes:

The reputation management framework should feed directly into a reputation resilience framework to help build enduring trust.

Crafting reputation resilience: A strategic framework for enduring trust

Reputation resilience framework

A robust reputation resilience framework integrates proactive reputation management with crisis preparedness and long-term strategic planning. The framework focuses on the integration of internal and external elements to build, maintain and protect an organization’s reputation.
This framework provides a structured, holistic approach, aimed to ensure that both internal and external drivers of reputation are strategically managed for long-term resilience.
Consider your own ability to drive preparedness across this framework:

Internal dimension: Building a strong core

External dimension: Strengthening stakeholder relationships

The internal dimension of reputation resilience focuses on strengthening the organization from within. This includes leadership, culture, processes, and employee engagement.
A strong internal core supports ethical behavior, innovation, and operational excellence, laying the foundation for external trust and reputation.

The external dimension of reputation resilience focuses on engaging with stakeholders outside the organization, including customers, investors, regulators, partners and the community.
External resilience relies on proactive engagement, strong relationships, and the ability to manage public perception effectively.

1. Leadership and governance
Are you able to cultivate leadership that embodies ethical behaviors, prioritizes reputation resilience in decision-making and can implement clear governance structures?

1. Stakeholder engagement and trust
Can you identify and prioritize key stakeholders and build a program of proactive engagement with them?

2. Culture and values
Do you foster a culture of open communication that encourages all employees to embed core values such as integrity into their decision-making?

2. Customer experience and satisfaction
Are you focused on the customer experience and the brand promise, and willing to develop strong feedback channels to address reputational concerns?

3. Processes and risk management
Are you capable of integrating reputation risk and crisis preparedness with wider risk management and internal controls?

3. Media and public relations
Are you willing to develop a clear communication strategy that aligns with organization values and reputation goals?

4. Employee engagement
Are you ready to invest in employee training and feedback mechanisms as well as help them become reputation ambassadors?

4. Corporate social responsibility (CSR) and sustainability
Do you have effective corporate social responsibility and sustainability initiatives that will make a positive contribution to your public reputation?

A step-by-step approach to framework implementation

To implement your reputation resilience framework to manage internal and external dimensions, we suggest a four-stage approach:

By focusing on both internal and external dimensions, the reputation resilience framework creates a holistic approach that builds a strong internal foundation while reinforcing relationships with external stakeholders.
This dual focus enables organizations to not only respond more effectively to crises but also proactively manage reputation, helping to ensure long-term success and stakeholder trust.

Quantifying reputation resilience: The data-driven path to measurable integrity

Having established a reputation management and reputation resilience framework, how do you know they are being effective? The answer is to be able to measure your progress against a series of metrics.
This is known as quantitative reputation resilience.
Quantitative reputation resilience involves the use of data, metrics and analytical tools to assess and manage reputation. This approach provides a measurable, data-driven foundation for reputation management, enabling organizations to track changes in reputation over time, correlate reputation with financial performance and predict potential impacts of reputational events.

Key measures and metrics should include:

Data sources will likely include:

Being able to effectively measure and track reputation resilience can help increase stakeholder confidence and will help maintain management buy-in to the topic.
Further reading on the contribution that quantifying reputation resilience to reputation management can be found in this helpful article: Resilience amid complexity – Quantifying disruption to help drive agility and sustainable growth.

Conclusion: Navigating complexity for long-term success

There are a number of challenges to overcome in building reputation resilience:

Despite the challenges, reputation resilience is an essential capability for modern organizations, enabling them to better protect and enhance their reputation in the face of challenges and crises. By implementing a broad reputation management framework that integrates both qualitative and quantitative approaches, organizations can proactively manage risks, respond effectively to crises and build a reputation that supports long-term success.
But it won’t happen without top-level commitment and without following some key principles of developing reputation resilience:

Continuous improvement, stakeholder engagement and data-driven decision-making are key elements in achieving and maintaining reputation resilience. Through a strategic and integrated approach, organizations can not only safeguard their reputation but also turn it into a source of competitive advantage.

https://kpmg.com/xx/en/our-insights/esg/beyond-the-cash.html,ESG,Beyond the cash,,"Family businesses in Asia Pacific are embracing ESG not because they have to, but because they want to.
There is a sense of urgency to accelerate sustainability efforts across industries globally. Family businesses are emerging as frontrunners in this landscape, boasting a “first-mover advantage” KPMG’s global study, surveying over 2,000 family businesses, indicates that 43 percent of family businesses are already actively pursuing high levels of sustainability and digitalization.1
The concept of ESG is intrinsically linked to family businesses, which naturally operate in a space where people — including employees and communities — sit at the center of their operations. Family businesses' success and inter-generational longevity often revolve around doing right by their people and giving back to the community. This ethos fosters mutual trust, respect and transparency, which are fundamental to ESG responsibility.
While they may not readily identify with the corporate label “ESG”, many families' values align closely with ESG principles, their actions and aspirations reflecting a commitment to sustainability, impact and ethical conduct. For them, ESG isn't just a box to check on a corporate report; it's an intrinsic part of their identity and business ethos.

More than just a label

There is a notable shift among family businesses in Asia Pacific towards integrating societal impact into wealth management strategies. Many business families have recognized a social obligation accompanying their wealth accumulation, driven by a sense of responsibility towards the communities that have contributed to their success.
Long-term and sustainable thinking are also inherent to many business families, given their multi-generational outlook. Their considerations often extend beyond immediate gains, encompassing the well-being of future generations and the communities in which they operate. This provides them with a framework for measuring and reporting their social impact and communicating them to a broad audience of existing and potential customers.
That is why many families are now aligning their businesses with ESG principles, not only as a moral obligation but also as a strategic imperative.
Environmental initiatives currently take precedence on families’ agendas, given the urgency of the climate change crisis, but social considerations remain important. As business families navigate the complexities of ESG implementation, they should consider factors such as costs, compliance requirements and resource constraints to determine the most relevant and impactful actions.

The key drivers of ESG in family business

The increased interest in ESG initiatives can be attributed to several factors.
First, the emergence of a younger generation in the region, that advocates strongly for ESG investment and positive change.
The second is the evolving regulatory landscape, especially in countries like Australia where climate-related financial disclosures are going to be mandatory from January 2025. Elsewhere, regions like the EU are increasingly demanding ESG compliance from businesses, compelling exporters to meet ESG standards to access and remain competitive in these markets.
These new rules are especially affecting mid-market companies, including family businesses and even small enterprises within their supply chains, compelling them to prioritize ESG practices.
Greater access to capital is another major driver. For example, according to Responsible Investment Association Australasia, approximately 93 percent of professionally managed capital in Australia — including institutional funds — are now subject to ESG investment mandates and policies. Separately, some banks are offering loans at attractive interest rates to companies that have strong ESG compliance and robust environmental management systems in place.
And lastly, as primarily people-driven entities, ESG bona fides give family businesses a competitive edge in attracting and retaining staff, especially in markets reliant on younger or more diverse workforces.

The ESG measurement and reporting conundrum

When it comes to measuring and reporting around ESG for their own internal purposes, families face unique challenges and opportunities.
Many families, for example those in countries such as Japan, have a deeply ingrained sense of privacy. This cultural aspect can make the concept of ESG measurement and reporting unsettling. Moreover, family businesses often resist adopting compliance frameworks typically associated with corporate ESG reporting, preferring instead to focus on their values and doing what they perceive as the right thing.
Some family businesses opt for an authentic and genuine approach to sustainability reporting, rooted in their family values and shared purpose. They may not adhere to formal frameworks but instead focus on demonstrating their commitment to sustainability through their actions.
However, there is also pressure for family businesses to conform to external expectations, such as demands for certifications or formal reporting under ESG frameworks. Currently, many family businesses engage in informal reporting, often through their websites, and as part of their marketing efforts rather than for transparency. But there appears to be a gradual shift towards recognizing the importance of transparency and the social license to operate, which may lead to more formalized ESG reporting in the future.

New ESG strategies for ASPAC business families

In Asia Pacific, many families have traditionally opted for philanthropic endeavors, setting up private ancillary funds or charities, and allocating a portion of their capital to donation initiatives. However, change is now underway as business families move towards impact investing and sustainable investing, in pursuit of societal impact alongside financial returns.
Anecdotal evidence suggests that some families are increasingly questioning the perceived mutual exclusivity between making money and creating social impact. Instead of simply donating capital, they are exploring avenues to invest in impactful ventures. For instance, a family in Melbourne recently chose to allocate around $50 million to establish its own impact investment fund. The family has reportedly seen better returns on this portion of its portfolio compared to other traditional investments, illustrating the viability of aligning financial gains with societal benefits. This is a story that is starting to be seen and heard more and more. Values and value should no longer be seen as automatically mutually exclusive.
Impact investing is also gaining traction for the same reasons. Projects such as fleet electrification, construction energy efficiency and waste reduction are seen as prudent choices that may not only save or generate revenue but can also improve brand reputation and customer appeal.
There is also a growing emphasis on stakeholder engagement and aligning values with strategic initiatives. Families are considering their stakeholders' priorities alongside their own, seeking genuine overlap that can drive both commercial success and positive social or environmental outcomes. While some are adopting ESG screens for investment decisions, others are exploring avenues through shareholder activism or incentivizing positive practices.
As the conversation around ESG continues to evolve, it is imperative for family businesses in Asia Pacific to recognize the link between their values and ESG principles.
By integrating ESG into their strategies, family businesses can not only safeguard their legacies but also contribute meaningfully to a more equitable and sustainable future for generations to come. As they embark on this journey, collaboration, transparency and a genuine commitment to positive impact can help unlock the full potential of ESG.

Banking is fundamentally an information business. One lesson regulators drew from the global financial crisis was that many banks lacked adequate systems to assemble and aggregate data on their exposures and risks. So in January 2013 the Basel Committee articulated its Principles for effective risk data aggregation and risk reporting
opens in a new tab
(RDARR), known as the BCBS 239 principles.
Yet as KPMG professionals wrote last year, over ten years since the adoption of BCBS 239 few banks have fully complied. The ECB has led the charge among global supervisors to require banks to do better.

Final Guide

The ECB’s latest step is the finalisation in May of its new Guide
opens in a new tab
on effective RDARR, following a consultation last year. The new Guide sets out the ECB’s expectations for how banks should implement the BCBS 239 principles. As in last year’s consultation draft, it requires banks to establish rigorous frameworks for data governance and data lineage, to ensure the quality and integrity of risk data. Banks should also have effective systems for timely regular risk reporting to top management and the capability to generate ad hoc reports at speed when required.
The final version of the Guide also goes further than the consultation draft in some key respects. It broadens the range of data subject to the BCBS 239 standard to include regulatory, supervisory and financial reporting such as COREP, FINREP and stress test returns. It requires banks to nominate 1 or 2 members of their management board as personally responsible for bringing their risk data systems up to scratch. Also, for the first time it explicitly discusses supervisory enforcement measures in case of non-compliance. These could include not only ‘traditional’ sanctions such as capital add-ons but also financial penalties and reassessments of the fitness and propriety of a bank’s management body or its members.

Penalty box

The emphasis on enforcement reflects frustration within the ECB at the slow pace of BCBS 239 implementation to date. In public statements ECB leaders have repeatedly hinted that this could be the next area for the imposition of periodic penalty payments (PPPs, daily fines for as long as a bank remains noncompliant), hitherto only deployed in the field of climate and environmental risk.
For example, in her very first speech
opens in a new tab
as Supervisory Board Chair Claudia Buch described up-to-date information systems as ‘indispensible’ and said the ECB would be ‘strengthening our efforts to ensure that long-standing shortcomings are remediated.’ Further in a July interview
opens in a new tab
Supervisory Board member Elizabeth McCaul highlighted risk data aggregation as a potential candidate for PPPs.
Aside from enforcement, we have seen the ECB’s campaign of on-site inspections on risk data aggregation and risk reporting continue. These inspections have typically been highly complex and challenging affairs, lasting up to 3 months, involving as many as 15 inspectors and often featuring risk data ‘fire drills’ in which banks are required to produce large quantities of data at short notice with little warning.

Driven by data

The ECB has long been known as a data-hungry supervisor, whose approach has been characterised by a high volume of extensive and detailed data requests. This has been motivated not only by an interest in the content of the data requested, but also by a concern to test the quality of banks’ internal information systems. For it is a core ECB belief that strong management information is an essential marker of a well-run bank. So banks should expect no let-up in ECB focus on this issue and should continue to upgrade their data capabilities in response.
Investing in internal data systems, however, is not just a matter of compliance. As business becomes increasingly data driven, and advances in data analytics allow for ever more sophisticated insights into customer behaviour and needs, the value of good data will only increase.
Better understanding of customers, markets and business is a competitive advantage that banks should invest to embrace.

Cyber threats are some of the most severe and dynamic operational risks that European banks face. As the economy becomes ever more digitalised, the cyber challenge is only set to grow.
Bank know that the cyber environment is rapidly evolving, demanding significant effort to ensure cyber security can keep pace. Key factors driving the need for heightened focus on cyber resilience include:

The disruption of July 2024 has further sharpened banks’ focus on cyber and information and communication technology (ICT) risks. It also highlighted the potential vulnerabilities that arise from the industry’s growing use of third-party service providers in the technology sector. Regulators and supervisors are also concerned about banks’ dependence on third parties for the provision of core operational services. These concerns are heightened by high levels of concentration among technology providers and the risks that can arise from sub-contracting — illustrated by the recent impact on Microsoft’s services.
Third-party provider outages like those in July can create a range of pain points for banks spanning several areas.

Source: KPMG International, 2024

With appropriate measures, banks can avoid these pain points.
Incident preparation: Adequate preparation for an emergency includes the following measures:
 Clear contractual clauses regarding service providers’ involvement in crisis management during cyber and ICT incidents.
Thorough mapping of interconnections between different assets in the ICT inventory and links between process landscape and ICT infrastructure.
Incident response: Immediate responses to cyber and ICT incidents are commonly made more efficient by:
Sufficiently documented contingency measures
Adequate planning of feasible workarounds.
Appropriate rollback strategies for successful recovery.
Crisis management: Banks’ ability to effectively recover from cyber-attacks and other critical incidents is typically enhanced by:
The inclusion of suitable scenarios in both the Business Continuity Plan (BCP) and the Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP).
Proper alignment with service providers over their responsibilities during the recovery phase.
The establishment of detailed, formalised crisis communication procedures.
Post-incident reworking: The ability to learn from experience and improve cyber incident planning is often supported by:
Strong post-incident analysis, evaluation and management reporting.
Suitable approaches to estimating economic impact and risk adjustments.
DORA is not specifically aimed at preventing or mitigating third party failures like the disruption experienced in July. However, it does bring the most critical service providers for leading banks under the direct supervision of the European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs) — the European Banking Authority (EBA), European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) and European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) — for the first time, and banks with a good level of DORA readiness should enjoy greater resilience to third-party outages. In this context, we see six key areas for banks to focus on as part of their DORA preparations:

No bank can predict when it will next become the target of a cyber-attack. But the frequency and severity of cyber incidents are only set to increase. Banks should act swiftly to strengthen their defences and upgrade their response plans to safeguard their resilience before trouble strikes.

The EBA starts the race

The 2025 stress test cycle has officially begun. On 5 July the European Banking Authority (EBA) released
opens in a new tab
its draft methodology and templates for consultation. The EBA aims to finalise these by the end of the year following industry comments, before starting the stress test itself in January. The EBA has announced that the stress test will cover 68 banks from the European Union (EU) and Norway, including 54 from the euro area. The ECB will then extend the stress test to all ‘significant institutions’ (SIs) under its supervision (with some adjustment for smaller banks in the name of proportionality).
As we have previously written
opens in a new tab
, the new stress test methodology represents an evolution, not a revolution, from previous exercises. The principal innovation is requiring banks to calculate their risk-weighted assets (RWAs) and capital ratios according to the new rules set out in the third EU capital requirements regulation (CRR 3), which became law this summer and will take effect from 1 January 2025.

The ECB is now a key player…

The European Central Bank (ECB) will play a key role in the 2025 stress test, including by scrutinizing the returns from SIs within the euro area. The stress test results will then be a key input into the capital, liquidity and governance/risk management elements of the 2025 Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP).

…With an increasing focus on stress tests

Indeed, in recent years stress tests have played an increasingly important part in the ECB’s overall supervisory approach. Since 2021 the ECB has used the degree of capital depletion identified by the stress test as the starting point for setting Pillar 2 capital guidance (P2G) under a ‘bucketing’ approach.
This growing importance of stress testing within ECB supervision looks set to the continue. The ECB’s Supervisory Board Chair Claudia Buch has spoken several times this year about the uncertainties — macroeconomic, geopolitical and environmental – facing European banks. In this context, she has advocated greater use of forward-looking risk assessment tools, such as stress tests. And the ECB has made use of stress tests to evaluate some of the emerging risks Buch identified: at the start of this year the ECB conducted its first cyber resilience stress test, assessing banks’ ability to respond to a severe cyber-attack.
The significance of stress tests was given a further boost by the ECB’s decision to include stress test returns within the scope of its risk data aggregation and risk reporting (RDARR) requirements. The ECB’s latest RDARR Guide
opens in a new tab
, released in May, specified for the first time that data compiled for stress tests must meet the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision’s (BCBS) 239 standards. Banks preparing for stress tests must therefore ensure their data governance and data lineage frameworks are robust. Stress test returns could themselves also be examined by the ECB as part of their ongoing campaign of BCBS 239 on-site inspections.

Getting ready for the stress test

The growing importance of stress testing underlines the need for banks to prepare thoroughly for the upcoming exercise. Three key areas of focus should be:

The launch of the 2025 stress test is now only a few months away. In our view, the more that banks can use that time to prepare, the better placed they will be for success in an increasingly crucial supervisory exercise.

Room for improvement

The European Central Bank (ECB) has long striven to improve the quality of banks’ internal governance and risk management. Historically this has been the element of the Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP) where banks have scored worst, with little sign of improvement in recent years. This has led to growing frustration among supervisors – and increasingly intrusive investigations.
In its Supervisory Priorities for 2024 the ECB therefore promised further action to tackle persistent deficiencies in the quality of banks’ management. To that end, on 24 July the ECB published its new draft Guide on Governance and Risk Culture (for consultation until 16 October). The new Guide, which draws on the results of a series of risk culture deep dives conducted last year, as well as wider thinking by the ECB and national central banks, updates the ECB’s 2016 Supervisory Statement on Governance and Risk Appetite.

Structure and behaviour

The Guide’s most significant innovation is the focus on behavioural aspects of risk culture: how employees act in practice when taking and managing risks. ECB Supervisory Board Vice-Chair Frank Elderson described informal behavioural norms as the ‘software’ of governance (complementing the ‘hardware’ of committee structures and formal policies) in a speech last September.
In the latest Guide the ECB sets out an expectation for bank leadership to articulate and encourage a healthy risk culture at all levels of the organisation. That should begin with bank leadership setting a clear ‘tone from the top’ on the importance of prudent risk management, as well as encouraging constructive challenge and welcoming diverse perspectives before decisions are taken.
This culture of prudence should be rooted in appropriate management structures. Boards and committees should be sufficiently large and diverse to accommodate a range of perspectives and expertise. In our view, banks should clearly allocate roles and responsibilities to allow for individual accountability. Risk management and other internal control functions must be independent of first-line business units and must be given sufficient resources and status within the organisation to be effective. Finally risk management goals should be reflected in banks’ compensation and reward policies to create strong individual incentives for prudence. The Guide does not prescribe precisely how banks should meet these expectations, but it does list both good practices and ‘red flags’ for governance and risk culture that the ECB has observed in the course of its supervisory activities.

Putting it into practice

The ECB will finalise the new Guide around the end of this year. Alongside, the ECB continues to scrutinise banks’ governance arrangements as part of its ongoing supervision. The ECB has extended its review of management body effectiveness (begun in 2023) into this year. This exercise has featured in-depth examinations of the workings of bank boards, including through supervisors attending board meetings.
KPMG professionals have also seen wider-ranging on-site inspections (OSIs) focusing on culture and governance. These have examined how internal controls are organized and how they function on a day-to-day basis, including through interviews with staff across all three lines of defence.
The publication of the new Guide makes clear that banks should expect this scrutiny to continue. Banks should therefore prepare for future examinations by reviewing their existing structures, policies and practices against the expectations in the Guide. As a first step they should check for any of the ‘red flags’ listed in Guide and should address them in advance of any supervisory inspection.
As we have written before, documentation is key to demonstrating robust governance and a healthy risk culture. In our view, banks should ensure that roles and responsibilities of management and control functions are clearly assigned, and that the strategies and policies governing business decisions are clearly framed and documented. Comprehensive records of internal communications, meeting discussions and outcomes, as well as of channels for staff to raise concerns, are also essential evidence to show supervisors that internal rules are applied in practice and risks are prudently managed.

Cultural assets

Improving governance and culture, however, is more than just an exercise in regulatory compliance. Research has shown it has clear benefits for business. Managements where roles, responsibilities and policies are clearly articulated, and in which leaders are open to hearing a range of opinions and perspectives will make better decisions. A clear sense of purpose boosts employee morale and engagement and aids the recruitment and retention of talent. The psychological safety to speak up about concerns or mistakes leads to earlier reporting of problems, fewer accidents or cases of misconduct and supports continuous learning and improvement. Finally, a positive corporate culture can strengthen an organisation’s public reputation. Together these effects improve companies’ financial performance.
Effective governance and a healthy culture thus help firms build long-term value. So, it is in banks’ interests to invest in their quality of management. Good leadership and a good culture are good for business.

The banking turmoil in the US last spring was a stark reminder of the risks from sudden changes in interest rates and credit spreads. Indeed volatility in these areas has had a direct impact on European banks’ profit and loss statements (P&L) and balance sheets over the past two years. This has prompted supervisors to increase their focus on Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book (IRRBB) and Credit Spread Risk in the Banking Book (CSRBB) – including via new IRRBB reporting requirements introduced by the European Banking Authority’s (EBA) Implementing Technical Standard (ITS). 
Banks have already committed more resources to meeting heightened IRRBB and CSRBB expectations, but supervisory attention continues to grow. One of the European Central Bank’s (ECB) Supervisory priorities for 2024-2026

is to:

""Challenge banks’ interest rate risk management framework to ensure they properly reflect prudent assumptions regarding customer behaviour and develop corresponding mitigation strategies commensurate to their risk profiles""

In consequence, the ECB has recently begun a new round of on-site inspections (OSIs) focusing on IRRBB and CSRBB. Key areas of scrutiny are likely to include:

Some key challenges facing banks

KPMG has recently conducted a fresh benchmarking exercise to better understand banks’ IRRBB and CSRBB circumstances, challenges and priorities in 2024. This study, which collected answers from more than 90 banks to a range of questions about current market practices and forthcoming changes, reveals many interesting and detailed findings. Three of the most notable headlines to emerge are as follows:

Key takeaways and areas of action

Based on KPMG’s benchmarking findings and the experience to date of banks undergoing OSIs, we view the following as among the areas where banks should prioritise their preparations for regulatory scrutiny of IRRBB and CSRBB:

Last year’s banking turmoil was a warning of the potential risks from rapid changes in interest rates. Supervisors were relieved at European banks’ resilience then, but are determined to ensure banks properly manage this risk in the years ahead.

https://kpmg.com/xx/en/our-insights/ecb-office/amla-is-here-now-what.html,Our Insights,AMLA is here… Now what?,,"October 2024

It’s official: AMLA is here

AMLA officially arrived in July. On 19 July, the Regulation
opens in a new tab
establishing the new EU Anti-Money Laundering Authority (AMLA) was published in the EU Official Journal, completing its long journey to the statute book. Seven days later, the legislation took effect and the agency at the heart of the new EU-wide AML regime formally came into being.
In parallel, the AML Regulation
opens in a new tab
— creating the new single AML Rulebook — was also published and took effect. The three-year countdown until the new rules enter force (to be supplemented by AMLA technical standards and guidelines) has thus started.

Starting up AMLA

The AMLA’s first months will be focused on institution building. Before the new agency can begin making regulations or defining supervisory policy it must first recruit key decision-makers and build up its operational infrastructure.
This process will be led by the European Commission (EC) AMLA Task Force. This special unit within the EC’s financial crime division has been developing practical plans for the new agency (covering everything from IT systems to business processes) while the AMLA Regulation worked its way through the legislative process. The Task Force will now act as a skeleton crew for AMLA in its initial start-up phase.

Appointing the leaders

The immediate priority is to appoint the AMLA’s leadership. The EC has already begun this process by advertising the position of Chair in June. The aim
opens in a new tab
is to have AMLA’s first Chair in place around the end of 2024, with the five Executive Board members (the EC advertised these positions
opens in a new tab
on 2 September) following in the first quarter of 2025.
This, however, is an ambitious objective given the elaborate appointment process set out in the AMLA Regulation. For the Chair, this specifies that the EC must propose a shortlist of at least two candidates, who may then be called for scrutiny hearings before the European Parliament (EP). Having had EP feedback, the EC will then nominate an AMLA Chair, who must be confirmed by both the EP (likely after a further hearing, and both committee and plenary votes) and EU governments before taking up the post. Given that the EP must first confirm a new EC Chair following June’s European elections, it remains to be seen whether an AMLA Chair can be appointed before the end of the year.

Beginning operations

Once the AMLA executive team is in place, it will be able to decide how the new agency is organised and managed. The EC plans for the AMLA to begin operations in mid-2025, focusing initially on establishing internal structures and systems.
After this, the EC expects the AMLA to begin consulting on implementing rules to complete the new single AML Rulebook in 2026. As we have previously written
opens in a new tab
, working groups coordinated by the European Banking Authority (EBA) have already begun informal work on multiple draft guidelines and technical standards. Once the AMLA has built up its policy-development capability (which could include hiring some current EBA staff), the new agency will take over the task of finalising these regulations.

Getting ready for the AMLA

Fighting financial crime is a marathon not a sprint, and the AMLA looks set for a measured start. With the rules it makes applying from mid-2027, and direct AMLA supervision beginning in 2028, regulated firms may be tempted to think there is little need to act now. In our view, that would be a mistake. The new AML Rulebook will require significant changes to firms’ internal controls, and the new EU-wide supervisory methodology AMLA will develop will have a major impact on how compliance is overseen. AMLA’s early months will provide important indications of its policy approach, as well as offering opportunities for the industry to engage with the new agency and share expertise.
In the months ahead, firms should review their existing AML practices against the new rules and closely monitor the AMLA’s first steps. KPMG’s AMLA Office will provide regular updates and analysis of the AMLA’s strategy, rulemaking and supervisory policy development. KPMG professionals are ready to support firms preparing for the new AML environment and working to become ‘AMLA ready’.

The first wave of companies is preparing to report under European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS). The first to report are the largest companies, but ultimately 50,000 companies will be required to report specific information under these new standards.
The standards – which will also impact many non-EU companies – have been developed and implemented at speed, with a commitment to maximising interoperability with the IFRS® Sustainability Disclosure Standards. You will find elements of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards and Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations, but the ESRS requirements are much more detailed than existing standards. The first wave of companies have had to learn and adapt quickly to get ready for their first reports. For many there are new complex concepts to understand, such as double materiality and disclosing information related to a company’s value chain.
ESRS Foundations provides the framework for our guidance. It explains these new concepts and helps you to understand how your company might apply the standards. It navigates the complexity of ESRS, pulling the detailed requirements together in one place and explaining them in plain English. It also includes insights and illustrative examples to help you to anticipate some of the key impacts.
Going forward we will expand the guidance, drawing from how companies are adapting to the new reporting environment and providing further insight and guidance on emerging issues, as well as illustrative examples.

Proposal to incorporate the GloBE Information Return into EU law and related exchange of information under the EU Minimum Tax Directive

On October 28, 2024, the European Commission adopted a proposal
opens in a new tab
for an extension of the Directive on Administrative Cooperation (DAC) to establish a framework for the exchange of Pillar Two information between Member States (DAC9).
The DAC9 proposal also introduces a new Annex to the DAC with a standard template, based on the OECD’s GloBE Information Return (as published in July 2023), which in-scope groups must use to file Top-up Tax Information Returns.

Background

As previously reported, the EU Minimum Tax Directive (2022/2523) entered into force on December 23, 2022, and required Member States to transpose the rules into domestic law by December 31, 2023.
Member States were generally required to start applying:
the Income Inclusion Rule (IIR) for fiscal years beginning on or after December 31, 2023, and
the Undertaxed Profits Rule (UTPR) for fiscal years beginning on or after December 31, 2024.
The Directive allows Member States to defer the application of the IIR and the UTPR up to December 31, 2029, where a maximum number of 12 ultimate parent entities (UPE) are based in that EU Member State. It is important to keep in mind that Member States that do not defer the application for the charging provisions will be required to apply the UTPR with respect to constituent entities resident in deferring EU jurisdictions.
In addition, the EU Directive provides the option for Member States to implement a qualified domestic top-up tax (QDMTT), without specifying an application date.
Following the entry into force of the EU Minimum Tax Directive, the Inclusive Framework published a number of additional rules and clarifications that supplement the OECD GloBE Model Rules. As part of this ongoing effort, the OECD published a standard template for the GIR in July 2023, which in-scope groups under the Pillar Two rules will use to meet their filing obligations (for more information, please refer to this KPMG report on the GIR). The aim of the DAC9 proposal is to transpose the GIR developed by the OECD into EU law by designating the GIR as the Top-up tax information return envisaged in Article 44 of the EU Minimum Tax Directive and to implement a framework to facilitate the exchange of Top-up tax information returns between EU Member States. It should be noted that the GIR published by the OECD in July 2023 may still undergo some changes as a result of future administrative guidance. These changes would be reflected in the Top-up tax information return via Commission delegated acts.

Proposed changes under DAC9

The proposal is split into two parts. It first provides for an extension to the DAC to introduce a framework for the exchange of information of Top-up tax information returns, and the second part is the introduction of a new Annex to the DAC with the standard form to be used for reporting and exchange of information.
Introduction of a new exchange of information framework
The DAC9 proposal introduces a new Article 8ae, which provides for the framework for the exchange of Top-up tax information returns filed by in-scope groups with tax administration in an EU Member State.
Article 44 of the EU Minimum Tax Directive sets out the filing requirements for entities in scope of the EU Minimum Tax Directive. As a general rule, it provides that each constituent entity located in an EU Member State shall file a Top-up tax information return with its tax administration. Tax administrations would then use these Top-up tax information returns to perform an appropriate risk assessment, to evaluate the correctness of the tax liability and to generally monitor whether MNEs and LSDGs correctly apply the rules of the EU Minimum Tax Directive.
However, a derogation from this general rule is available (Article 44(3)), whereby Constituent Entities based in an EU Member State are exempt from their filing obligations where two conditions are met:
the UPE of the group, or a designated entity, files the Top-up tax return on behalf of the MNE group, and
the relevant tax authority with which the return was filed has an exchange framework or an international agreement in place to exchange the return with other jurisdictions.
The purpose of the DAC9 proposal is to introduce such an exchange framework between Member States, therefore allowing MNEs to switch from local to central filing in the EU, where the EU UPE or designated filing entity files on behalf of the group in an EU Member State. In that case, the EU Minimum Tax Directive (Article 44 (4)), still requires each constituent entity in the Member State or the designated local entity on its behalf, to notify its tax administration of the identity of the entity that is filing the Top-up tax information return, as well as the jurisdiction in which it is located. The framework only covers the exchange between Member States. For the exchange of information with third countries, Member States will have to sign appropriate international agreements with those jurisdictions.
Use of a dissemination approach for the exchange of information
The proposal includes a dissemination approach for the exchange of information to ensure that Member States only receive the information they need based on their role in the MNE group, as provided by the OECD framework. The following approach is proposed:
the Member State of the UPE receives the full Top-up tax information return;
all Implementing Member States receive the full general section of the Top-up tax information return;
QDTT-only Member States, where constituent entities of the MNE are located, receive the general section of the Top-up tax information return, with the exception of the high-level summary information section;
Member States with taxing rights under the EU Minimum Tax Directive (IIR or UTPR) receive specific jurisdictional sections. UTPR jurisdictions with a UTPR percentage of zero should only be provided with the parts of Top-up tax information return that contains information on the attribution of Top-up tax under the UTPR in respect of that jurisdiction, and the Implementing Member State in which the UPE is located shall be provided with all jurisdictional sections.
Timing considerations
Under the EU Minimum Tax Directive (Article 44(7)), the filing of Top-up tax information returns should be done no later than 15 months after the last day of the reporting fiscal year, with the exception of the first year a group enters into scope, where the filing deadline would be no later than 18 months after the last day of the reporting fiscal year (Article 51).
The relevant sections of the Top-up tax information return should be exchanged with the appropriate Member States as soon as possible, and no later than three months after the reporting fiscal year's filing deadline. For the first reporting year, however, an extended deadline of six months from the filing date will apply. The proposal also provides that any Top-up tax information returns received after the filing deadline must also be exchanged as soon as possible and within three months of receipt.
The proposal provides a possibility for the competent authority to enquire about a Top-up tax information return that was notified by a local constituent entity to have been filed centrally in another Member State, but which has not been exchanged. The competent authority of the Member State of the filing entity can then verify if the report has been filed and enquire about the expected date of filing if this has not already been done. In cases where the Top-up tax information return has not been received within three months of the new expected filing date, local filing requirements may be imposed on the constituent entities of the MNE, but not before the abovementioned deadline has passed.
If upon receipt and verification, competent authorities believe that corrections are needed, they should notify the other receiving competent authorities in other Member States and take appropriate steps to obtain a corrected Top-up tax information return and exchange it with the relevant authorities of Member States.
For those Member States that have opted to defer the application of the IIR and the UTPR up to December 31, 2029, as per Article 50(1) of the EU Minimum Tax Directive, the provisions of this DAC9 proposal will apply beginning with the first fiscal year following the end of that deferral period.
New annex on filing rules and form for Top-up tax information return
The proposal also introduces a new Annex VII
opens in a new tab
to the DAC, consisting of three sections. The first section includes relevant definitions, the second provides information on the filing rules, and the third includes the standard form for the Top-up tax information return. As per the explanatory memorandum, the return is fully in line with the GIR but includes certain minor modifications to align the reporting form with the requirements under the EU Minimum Tax Directive.
Penalties
The proposal leaves it to the Member States to introduce penalties for failing to comply with the requirements of national legislation implementing DAC9. However, penalties must be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.

Next steps

As is the case for all other amendments to the DAC, the legal basis for the DAC9 proposal is formed of Articles 113 and 115 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), meaning that the Directive requires unanimous approval in the Council. In addition, the Council would only be allowed to adopt the text once the Parliament and any relevant Committees have given their (non-binding) opinions. Where the Directive is approved in the Council, it would enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the EU.
Once adopted, EU Member States would be required to transpose the Directive into domestic legislation by December 31, 2025, with the first exchange of information taking place at the latest six months after the filing of the first Top-up tax information return. For calendar year taxpayers, the first exchange would take place after their first filing deadline on June 30, 2026, and exchanges would be made by December 31, 2026, at the latest.
For Member States that have opted to defer the implementation of the IIR and UTPR according to Article 50(1) of the EU Minimum Tax Directive, the transposition deadline would be the day before the end of the deferral period.
As for the other DACs, the proposal also indicates that the communication of information between the competent authorities of Member States should take place using a standard computerized form. This form would be developed by the Commission by means of implementing acts.
The European Commission has not yet opened a public consultation on the proposal.

ETC Comment

KPMG observations:
The DAC9 proposal establishes a framework for the exchange of Top-up tax information returns, which serve as the equivalent of the Global Information Return (GIR) under the OECD Pillar Two Framework. In the related press release, the Commission emphasizes that this proposal would significantly simplify the filing process and reduce the administrative burden for MNE groups. According to the Explanatory memorandum to DAC9, the proposal contributes to the Commission’s efforts to rationalize and simplify reporting requirements for business, with the aim of reducing this burden by 25 percent, in line with the EC’s commitments as laid down in its Communication to the European Parliament and the Council, on the “Long-term competitiveness of the EU: looking beyond 2030” (COM/2023/168 final).
It’s important to keep in mind that the DAC9 proposal does not address any other form of local filing requirements beyond the Top-up tax information return. In the explanatory notes, the Commission makes the point that jurisdictions should generally refrain from requiring the reporting of additional data points beyond the Top-up tax information return as part of their routine tax return and payment requirements. Some countries are already in the process of requiring local tax returns. For example, Germany has launched a public consultation earlier this year on a local minimum tax return (for more information, please refer to E-News Issue 196). Also, the OECD Inclusive Framework, in its July 2023 Administrative Guidance on QDMTT design and implementation, specifies that QDMTT jurisdictions are not required to use the GIR for purposes of the QDMTT information collection. Jurisdictions may therefore require QDMTT information in a different format than the GIR – this is for example the case in Belgium, where a public consultation on a draft Pillar Two return was launched in October 2024 (for more information, please refer to the report prepared by KPMG in Belgium). These local QDMTT information returns do not necessarily follow a standard form and are not covered by the DAC9 proposal. Therefore, MNEs and LSDGs should carefully monitor potential additional local filing requirements they may be subject to.
It is furthermore important to note that the proposal does not address exchanges with non-EU jurisdictions. The expectation is that Top-up tax information returns filed by in-scope groups outside of the European Union (i.e., by a non-EU UPE or designated filing entity) will be shared with other relevant tax authorities (including in EU Member States) based on exchange relationships activated through the OECD inclusive Framework. The mechanisms provided for under DAC9 will not be relevant in such situations.
By implementing the Top-up tax information return in line with the GIR (as published in July 2023), Member States would be required to report on certain data points that are not part of the EU Minimum Tax Directive, but that have been introduced at a later stage as part of the additional clarifications and rules. This would be in line with the Commission’s view, which was confirmed on several occasions that the Safe Harbour rules and the Administrative Guidance agreed by the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework subsequent to the adoption of the EU Minimum Tax Directive are compatible with the EU implementation of the rules. In addition, the explanatory notes to the proposed Directive provide that the GIR filing instructions (as published in July 2023) are considered a useful source of interpretation for MNEs to file the Top-up tax information return.
Finally, it should also be noted that the Top-up tax information return may still be subject to change due to the ongoing work and release of additional Administrative Guidance at OECD level. Therefore, the explanatory notes clarify that the Top-up tax information return can be amended any time by the Commission through delegated acts to reflect future updates agreed at international level.
State of Play:
As reported previously, all Member States were required to transpose the rules into domestic law by December 31, 2023, and apply the Income Inclusion Rule (IIR) for fiscal years beginning on or after December 31, 2023, and the Undertaxed Profits Rule (UTPR) for fiscal years beginning on or after December 31, 2024.
The Directive allows Member States to defer the application of the IIR and the UTPR up to December 31, 2029, where a maximum number of 12 UPEs are based in that EU Member State. It is important to keep in mind that Member States that do not defer the application for the charging provisions will be required to apply the UTPR with respect to constituent entities resident in deferring jurisdictions. Five jurisdictions, Estonia, Malta, Latvia, Lithuania, and Slovakia have opted for the deferral. For Slovakia, the deferral applies to IIR and UTPR only. Lithuania issued draft legislation to implement IIR, UTPR, and a domestic top-up tax (DMTT) as from 2025.
The EU Directive provides the option for Member States to implement a DMTT without specifying an application date. All Member States have opted to implement such a DMTT as from 2024, with the exception of Poland, which currently proposes that DMTT as from 2025 (with an option for groups to apply the rules retroactively as from 2024), and Estonia, Malta, Latvia and Lithuania that have opted for the deferral.
Four Member States, Cyprus, Poland, Portugal, and Spain are still in the process of transposing the EU Minimum Tax Directive into domestic legislation. They were referred to the CJEU on October 3, 2024. For previous coverage, please refer to E-News Issue 201).
In Cyprus, a bill was submitted to the Parliament in October 2024. According to the bill, IIR would take effect from 2024 and UTPR and DMTT would apply as from 2025.
In Poland, draft legislation was submitted to the lower house of Parliament in September 2024. The IIR and DMTT would apply for financial years starting on or after December 31, 2024, meaning that the timeline is deferred by one year compared to the EU Directive requirements. However, Poland included an option for a taxpayer to make an election to apply the rules earlier, from January 1, 2024.
In Portugal, draft legislation was approved by the Parliament in October 2024. As a final legislative step, the bill needs to be published in the Official Gazette.
Spain published a revised version of the draft law in June 2024 that provides for the application of the IIR and DMTT for financial years starting on or after December 31, 2023, and the UTPR for financial years starting on or after December 31, 2024.

Now, the focus is shifting to actualizing AI’s transformative potential. As leading organizations look beyond the noise, they are implementing effective AI use cases to meet rising customer expectations. As they do, they are using a pragmatic approach that prioritizes practicality, purpose and value – all grounded in trust.
For 15 years, KPMG professionals have been asking consumers about their individual experiences with brands. This year, the KPMG Global Customer Experience Excellence (CEE) 2024-2025 report explores how leading organizations have rapidly implemented AI with swift return on investments and enhanced customer experiences. It delves into the realities of AI implementation from leading brands and looks ahead to the critical factors for AI to reach new heights in customer experience excellence.
This year’s CEE results show a stabilization in overall customer experience with a small rise in most countries. This turnaround from last year comes from more brands humanizing their AI interfaces to make them more engaging and relatable to customers.

Successfully implementing AI requires organizations to adopt an approach that differs significantly from traditional IT processes to meet rising customer expectations with this technology.

Consumers want to connect with personalities, not machines. Leading organizations are beginning to humanize their AI systems with human-like characteristics that can offer more personalized, emotionally resonant experiences with their distinct personalities and conversational style.

Regular interaction with advancing technologies has consumers putting a higher value on ethical and honest business practices. This year’s report finds Integrity (18.8%) to be the biggest driver of NPS (net promoter score). Personalization (20.2%) is biggest driver of Loyalty, highlights the importance of tailored customer interactions.

Customer expectations continue to evolve. Yet, now, with the growing adoption of AI, concerns and attitudes towards cost-of-living, ESG (environment, social and governance) and AI continue to emerge. Understanding these concerns will be crucial to organizations looking to create value through AI.

To achieve this, leaders have been embracing technologies including Artificial Intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), advanced data and analytics, Robotic Process Automation (RPA), blockchain, and other cutting-edge capabilities. These have all made an impact, but there is more on the way.

The next wave of technology is both here and emerging. Generative AI (Gen AI) and Quantum Computing (QC) present immense potential to take the supply chain to the next level. The challenge is now on for supply chain leaders to work out which new capabilities will have a real impact on their organization’s supply chain agility and resilience, while also improving overall business performance.

Advances to date

In recent years, efforts to inject new technologies into the supply chain have resulted in a performance uplift for many organizations across multiple sectors. The “Industry 4.0” evolution saw leaders focus on end-to-end digitalization, integrating the data of partners far along the value chain for enhanced visibility, and connecting physical assets using IoT capabilities. The advances of big data analytics, 3D printing, industrial sensors, RPA, blockchain, digital twins, Augmented Reality (AR), and Virtual Reality (VR) have been key to this movement, making the “smart supply chain” the new normal.
As a result of these transformations, supply chain leaders have gained more informed decision-making capabilities, real-time visibility, greater supply chain transparency, and the increased ability to diagnose and test issues at various points, as well as rapidly responding to disruption. Cost savings, enhanced productivity, new business models, sustainability, and easier regulatory compliance are just some of the further benefits. However, in today’s complex environment, where new geopolitical issues, climate change, and ever-growing regulatory requirements can upturn the supply chain with little notice, there is room for even more agility and resilience.

How could the next wave of technologies take supply chain progress even further?

Generative AI 
Gen AI – the ability for computing to draw on vast data sets, rapidly create content, and self-learn for future improvement – has attracted significant interest in terms of how it could supercharge the supply chain. Across many sectors, Gen AI use in the supply chain is growing beyond proof of concepts, and its value is starting to show.
A key area where Gen AI is adding real value is in procurement, where it can help team members sort through large amounts of structured and unstructured data such as contracts and spreadsheets. Another is in category management, where Gen AI can assist with spend planning and forecasting, demand and requirements analysis, supply market analysis, and category strategy development and improvement recommendations.
Executives expect Gen AI to have an enormous impact on business. According to the 2024 KPMG U.S. CEO Outlook Pulse Survey, 41% plan to increase their investment in Gen AI next year, and 95% already have ongoing AI education and training.

Other areas where Gen AI can make an impact include:

Quantum Computing (QC) 
While still an emerging field, QC is expected to bring extreme computational power at immense speed. It is anticipated it will transform how insights can be extracted from vast data sets, and that it will deliver a comprehensive new level of predictive analytics.
When it comes to supply chains, QC’s ability to solve complex optimization, forecasting and simulation problems faster than a classical computer will give leaders unique control. QC could support logistics by identifying near-optimal routes for shipping goods in real time, or it could improve network design by processing vast numbers of designs at once to find the fastest and most cost-effective option.
QC should lead to more optimal choices, whether it be finding a new source material amid an unplanned disruption, or diverting a last-mile route in real time to avoid delays. Significantly, the overall impact of QC’s speed, breadth, and depth could boost supply chain resilience, with leaders more informed, agile, and responsive to change.

Other key areas where QC could make a significant impact include:

Responsible implementation

As supply chain leaders embrace innovative technologies such as Gen AI and QC, it will be wise to balance a fast uptake with a responsible approach to implementation and use. A focus on data ethics – such as the sorts of data the tools are drawing on, and how that data is used – is vital, as is understanding any new risks introduced – such as the risk of AI making errors. Likewise, staying ahead of regulatory requirements aligned to the new technologies will be essential for growth and protecting the organization’s reputation.

End-to-end impact

In addition to considering ethics and risks, supply chain leaders will also benefit from thinking holistically rather than tactically to make the most of new technologies. The best results come when the business need is the starting point for technology investment, and the right new technology is sought to support that need, not the other way around.
Further, better outcomes come from applying the new technologies at an end-to-end process taxonomy level rather than at an individual task or activity level. For example, many supply chain leaders are keen to use Gen AI, yet they are just taking a low-level task and automating it with Gen AI. This may result in a useful output, but it may be small and immaterial to the overall performance of the supply chain, making the return on investment poor. Greater impact may be achieved by considering the end-to-end supply chain, encompassing physical, process, and data operations, and how Gen AI could bring improvements in a seamless, connected way.

To date, new and emerging technologies such as automation, AI, IoT and blockchain have impacted the speed of decision making, and agility to respond to trends, risks, and variability. The tools have supported physical efficiencies, prediction and planning, and more. The next wave of technologies, including Gen AI and QC, has the potential to take this progress further.
KPMG’s deep experience in emerging technologies and the supply chain means we can help you use the right tools to uplift your operations strategically and holistically. Working together, a fully automated supply chain that responds in real time to disruption could one day be possible. It could include features such as working capital that automatically moves to the right spots; or products that are automatically sent in advance of need, giving customers what they want, when, and where. Importantly, we can help you drive supply chain resilience and overall business performance.

https://kpmg.com/xx/en/our-insights/transformation/a-winning-recipe-for-wendys-employees.html,Transformation,Serving up HCM change – A winning recipe for Wendy’s employees,,"Modern HCM for a modern workforce The challenge: Overcoming multiple systems and disparate processes to create cohesion and accuracy.

With over 7,000 outlets in 30 countries, like many organizations, Wendy’s HR systems were a complex patchwork of different technologies, interfaces, and data sources that created inefficiencies, additional costs, and inconsistencies.  As part of their Work Done Right initiative, Wendy’s brought in KPMG’s US firm to help reset the overall project and to assist in re-imagining, developing, and launching a new cloud-based HCM platform.
“Myself, the CIO, and the CFO were very active and hands on as executive sponsors,” said Coley O’Brien, Chief People Officer, The Wendy’s Company. “We knew it was critical for us to work together to align, make decisions and get the team going.""
Wendy’s was committed to upgrading its legacy HR systems by investing in Oracle’s cloud-based HCM platform for 14,000 employees at its corporate offices and 400+ company-owned restaurants. After a competitive review process, Wendy’s chose KPMG in the US to design, build, and deploy the new system based on KPMG professionals deep experience with Oracle systems, including many successful HCM deployments of considerable complexity.

“One of the things I really appreciated about KPMG was they were willing to offer suggestions, ideas or a contrarian point of view – all in the spirit of helping us get to a better solution or outcome.” 
Coley O’Brien,
Chief People Officer,
The Wendy’s Company

The response: One team, one system, one data model

KPMG helped Wendy’s go live with their new HCM platform with tightly integrated modules designed for their needs on payroll, compensation, time and labour, benefits, performance, onboarding, and more. The modern, user-friendly interfaces include easy web and mobile access and feature “Patty,” a chatbot that responds to HR-related questions. KPMG’s US professionals also helped with the integration of Wendy’s related enterprise data management cloud services.
“KPMG’s support allowed us to go from multiple systems and a disparate data model to one data model and one system. We would not have been successful if the KPMG team did not bring their absolute best people” observed Elise Baer, Product Owner, HR Systems, The Wendy’s Company.

The outcome: Accuracy, consistency, and a winning employee experience that helps retention

Wendy’s new people-first system offers an enterprise talent management technology system that is designed to deliver real-time data decision-making tools, consistent workflows, and digital-first capabilities. Additionally, it reduces the potential for high-profile errors (for example, miscalculated wage payments or missed tax deductions) while streamlining compliance management and reporting.
Perhaps most important, the Oracle HCM system is highly adaptable and scalable, making it easier to add new features like Oracle's generative AI (natively built within the platform) to help keep businesses at the leading edge.

Meet the people behind the story

“The relationship we had with Wendy’s really was summarized in two parts. There was leadership, and governance that was truly an enabler. Then we collaborated passionately, such that we’re delivering the right approach the first time.”

https://kpmg.com/xx/en/our-insights/regulatory-insights/a-new-agenda-for-uk-financial-services.html,Regulatory Insights,"A ""new"" agenda for UK financial services",,"The UK government has set out a collection of announcements to take forward its ambition for the UK to be the world's most innovative and competitive global financial centre  — labelled `The Edinburgh Reforms'. Although the number and scope of announcements is large, many of the items have been under discussion and consultation for the last few years so will not come as a surprise to industry participants. Indeed, the Financial Services & Markets Bill, under negotiation in Parliament, proposes the legislative framework for many of these announcements. 
As a whole, the announcement represents efforts to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of existing regulation by tailoring it to UK markets, as well as updating it to reflect new technologies and broader emerging policy themes such as the transition to net zero. 
Firms may already have begun to consider some of the proposed initiatives in their regulatory change plans and business models — these initiatives will give rise to a sustained stream of regulatory developments and there is considerable opportunity for the industry to engage and shape future policy direction through working groups, taskforces, consultations and other fora. We will assess potential impacts on firms in the next issue of the KPMG Regulatory Barometer.

Regulatory Framework
Senior Managers and Certification Regime (SMCR)
Banking
Retail markets
Wholesale markets
Sustainable finance
Digital Finance and Innovation

Regulatory Framework

New remit letters to the PRA and FCA (required at least once in each Parliament) show the government's continuing emphasis on the need for regulators to keep in mind growth and international competitiveness when delivering their work. This is in line with the likely introduction of new secondary objectives through the Financial Services and Markets Bill (FSMB). 
The government has also published the plan for repealing and reforming 43 `core files' of retained EU law (REUL). Financial Services will be excluded from the wider Retained EU Law (Revocation and Reform) Bill which aims to repeal REUL by end of 2023. Instead, under the repeal provisions proposed in the FSMB, the government will repeal FS REUL in a way that is `thoughtfully planned and sequenced to minimise unnecessary disruption while taking the opportunity to maximise the potential for the greatest economic impact.' Work will be split into Tranches with significant progress on Tranches 1 and 2 planned by the end of 2023.
Tranche 1 includes delivering the outcomes arising from the Wholesale Markets Review, Lord Hill's Listing Review, and the review of the Solvency II Directive. 
Tranche 2 includes reviewing, repealing and reforming the Money Market Funds Regulation, the Insurance Mediation and Distribution Directives, and the Capital Requirements Regulation and Directive.

Senior Managers and Certification Regime (SMCR)

The government and regulators will commence a review of the SMCR in Q1 2023. The government will launch a Call for Evidence to look at the legislative framework of the regime, and the FCA and PRA will review the regulatory framework. Given that the regime has now been in place for banks and insurers since 2016 and was rolled out to the wider financial services sector in 2018, the review seems timely. Critics may be keen to point out the lack of enforcement action against individuals under the regime and the administrative burden of regulatory approval of SMs. Supporters may note that perceived limitations of the SMCR should not be conflated with recent delays caused by supervisory resourcing and will argue that the regime has led to improvements in governance, risk management and accountability.

Banking

The proposed reforms for banks are intended to support domestic competitiveness and remove barriers to growth for smaller firms:
Ring-fencing — the government has published its response to the March 2022 independent review on ring-fencing and proprietary trading. It will now consult on a series of mid-term reforms in mid-2023, with the intention of bringing forward secondary legislation later in the year to improve the functionality of the ring-fencing regime. The reforms would:
Take banking groups without major investment banking operations out of the regime.
Update the definition of Relevant Financial Institution.
Remove blanket geographical restrictions on ring-fenced banks operating subsidiaries or servicing clients outside the European Economic Area.
Review and update the list of activities which ring-fenced banks are restricted from carrying out, to assess whether certain activities could in future be undertaken safely by ring-fenced banks in order to improve the supply of financial services to consumers and businesses. 
  There will also be a public Call for Evidence in the first quarter of 2023 to review the practicalities of aligning the ring-fencing and resolution regimes.

Non-performing exposures (NPEs)  — the PRA intends to consult on removing rules for the capital deduction of certain NPEs held by banks. This would enable a judgement-led approach to address the adequacy of firms' provisioning for NPEs, help to simplify the UK rulebook and avoid the unnecessary gold plating of prudential standards. 

Amendments to the Building Societies Act 1986 — the government has published the  responses to its earlier Call for Evidence and will now legislate to give building societies greater flexibility to raise wholesale funds, while retaining their mutual model. This will also entail modernisation of relevant corporate governance requirements in line with the Companies Act 2006.

Retail markets

The package of measures relating to retail markets is designed principally to provide additional protection for retail consumers by updating existing regulatory requirements to make them more effective, efficient and tailored to the current UK market. 
A review of the PRIIPs Regulation was previously proposed but the government has now initiated a consultation on plans to revoke it whilst also seeking views on an alternative framework for retail disclosure. The reform will be widely welcomed as the existing requirements are unduly burdensome and too narrowly focused on inflexible, prescriptive regulatory disclosure rather than meeting the information needs of retail customers. In parallel, the FCA has launched a discussion paper on the future disclosure framework. The new framework will likely mirror the approach adopted for the Consumer Duty which places a greater emphasis on the outcomes being generated for retail customers.  
The government is consulting on the consumer information requirements under the Payment Account Directive 2015. In a similar vein to the PRIIPs regulation, the proposed reforms are designed to address criticisms that existing requirements are too prescriptive or unnecessary in the UK context and therefore do not allow customers to readily compare current accounts. 
The reform statement also highlights the current consultation which aims to modernise the Consumer Credit Act (1974) to afford a greater degree of protection for consumers and improve outcomes. The consultation is ambitious in nature and is initially seeking views on the strategic direction of reform. 
Alongside the above consultations, the government also announced its future intentions to consult on or implement changes on the following topics:
New guidance to Local Government Pension Schemes on asset pooling by requiring them to ensure they are considering investment opportunities in illiquid assets.
A new Value for Money framework for pensions, which will set standards in key areas such as investment performance, cost and charges and quality of service. This is designed to improve the pace of pension consolidation out of poorly governed and underperforming schemes.
The repeal of EU legislation on the European Long-Term Investment Fund (ELTIF) to recognise that the new UK Long-Term Asset Fund (LTAF) provides a better fund structure for the UK market. To note, there are currently no UK ELTIFs so there will not be any backward-looking impact on firms.
Amendments to the tax rules for Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) to remove some of the restrictions as well as ensuring that rules operate in line with their original intention.
Codifying current UK policy for the VAT treatment of fund management into UK law. 
The government also reiterates its intention to work with the FCA as it (re)examines the longstanding issue of the appropriateness of the boundary between advice and guidance with the aim (again) of seeking to improve access to helpful support, information and advice —while maintaining strong protections for consumers.

Wholesale markets

The announcement shows the continuing government focus on strengthening UK capital markets. New initiatives are: 
Establishing an Accelerated Settlement Taskforce — this will consider a UK approach to reducing settlement times to T+1. The US market is likely to move to T+1 settlement in 2024. 
An independent review of investment research which is likely to review the impact of the MiFID II research unbundling rules. The European Commission is proposing to further relax these rules in the EU.
Launching a Call for Evidence on reforming the Short Selling Regulation.
Working with the regulators and market participants to trial a new class of wholesale market venue which would operate on an intermittent trading basis. This is likely to support the secondary trading in private company shares and help facilitate their transition to public companies. 
Beyond these announcements there are a series of other items which have been widely discussed and consulted upon:
From the Wholesale Markets Review:
A commitment to have a regulatory regime in place by 2024 to support a consolidated tape for market data.
Secondary legislation in Q1 2023 to remove burdens for firms trading commodities derivatives as an ancillary activity.
Publication of draft Statutory Instruments to implement the outcomes of prior consultations on the reform of the prospectus and securitisation regimes, and the Secondary Capital Raising Review.

Sustainable Finance

The government has announced its intention to publish an updated Green Finance Strategy early in 2023. No further detail has been provided, but this is expected to contain an update on the UK Green Taxonomy. 
In Q1 2023 the government will also consult on bringing ESG ratings providers into the regulatory perimeter — a move which the FCA has previously called for and has pre-empted with the creation of its voluntary ESG Data and Ratings Code of Conduct Working Group.

Digital Finance and Innovation

In order to support innovation and leadership in emerging areas of finance, the government has reiterated its intention to:
Establish an FMI Sandbox in 2023 (to test and adopt new developments such as Distributed Ledger Technology) — legislation supporting this is in the Financial Services and Market Bill (FSMB). 
Legislate to bring payment stablecoins within the regulatory perimeter (also ensuring that this perimeter could be adapted to include investment-related cryptoassets at a later date). 
Publish a consultation exploring the case for a Central Bank Digital Currency —with an accompanying Technology Working Paper from the BoE. 
The government has also published its formal response to the consultation on expanding the Investment Management Exemption to include cryptoassets which will facilitate their inclusion in the portfolios of overseas funds managed in the UK.
However, most notable, was the lack of reference to a consultation on regulating unbacked cryptoassets — something which had previously been expected before the end of 2022.

 include work arising from the review of multiple directives (including MiFID II/MiFIR, UCITS, AIFMD and CSDR), further developing the SFDR, delivering a final report on greenwashing and finalising technical standards under MiCA and DORA. From 2025, ESMA will also add a new strategic supervisory priority
opens in a new tab
 focusing on cyber risk and digital resilience.
The EBA
opens in a new tab
 will concentrate on implementation of the EU banking package (CRR3/CRD6) and EBA Data Strategy, developing oversight and supervisory capacity for DORA and MiCA and managing the transition to the new AML / CFT framework. The ECB is due to publish its SSM priorities for 2024-2026 imminently. 
EIOPA will focus on integrating ESG risks into the prudential framework, implementing DORA and the ESAP, and the Solvency II review. 
November marked twelve months since the ESRB's first ever “general warning
opens in a new tab
” about financial stability risks and presents an opportunity for national supervisors to take stock of the ecosystem. Risk levels for the EU insurance sector have increased since our last edition — with exposures to macro, market and digitalisation now categorised as high risk in EIOPA's Dashboard
opens in a new tab
. The ECB
opens in a new tab
 has also noted that the financial stability outlook remains fragile as tighter financial conditions spread to the real economy in an environment of weak growth, high inflation and heightened geopolitical tensions.  
In a potential boost for regulatory cooperation, the first meeting
opens in a new tab
 of the new EU/UK Financial Regulatory Forum took place in October, following the signing of a memorandum of understanding (MoU) in May. Both sides discussed practicalities for future collaboration under the arrangement and provided updates on their respective agendas.

Progressing the regulatory agenda

In the banking sector, the EBA has published non-binding recommendations
opens in a new tab
 on enhancing the Pillar 1 framework to capture environmental and social risks. These are to be considered alongside ongoing amendments to the CRR — noting that the compromise text for CRR and CRD has just been published and will now be voted upon. The EBA has published its second mandatory exercise
opens in a new tab
 on Basel III full implementation which indicates that European banks' minimum Tier 1 capital requirement would increase by 9% in 2028, driven mainly by the output floor and credit risk. And the EC has adopted a mandate
opens in a new tab
 to start negotiations with Parliament on the `Daisy Chain' proposal (a targeted amendment to BRRD and the SRMR on the treatment of internal MREL). 
In insurance, EIOPA has now submitted to the EC its technical
opens in a new tab
 advice on the review of the IORP II Directive (which regulates the activities and supervision of institutions for occupational retirement provisions). EIOPA has also released for consultation a draft opinion on the supervision of captive (re)insurance undertakings.
In capital markets, ESMA published a Call for Evidence (and parallel consultation with central banks) on shortening the settlement cycle. It also coordinated the participation of the majority of EU CCPs in a global fire-drill
opens in a new tab
. The review of CSDR has been agreed
opens in a new tab
 — introducing a simpler passporting regime between Member States and confirming that mandatory buy-ins can only be introduced as a measure of last resort. The regulation creating the European Single Access Point (ESAP) has also been agreed
opens in a new tab
, establishing a platform (from summer 2027) that will host financial and non-financial information about EU companies and EU investment products.
For asset managers, the ESAs published their second annual review
opens in a new tab
 of voluntary disclosures of principal adverse impacts made under the SFDR — showing an overall improvement from the prior year. The Commission is continuing its fundamental review of the SFDR, and separately the ESAs have proposed
opens in a new tab
 changes to the Level 2 requirements. More broadly, the review of the AIFMD is almost complete, as the Council of the EU published the final compromise text
opens in a new tab
 with amendments to the AIFMD and UCITS Directive — this is now subject to formal approval. Separately, fund managers wishing to launch ELTIFs under the ELTIF 2.0 framework will be able to do so once it takes effect on 10 January 2024. EU fund managers will also be interested in tracking the FCA’s Overseas Funds Regime consultation that will determine the information they would need to provide in the event of any equivalence decisions by HMT.
The EC has published an amended draft act on the specification of criteria for critical ICT third-party service providers (CTPPs) and determining oversight fees — following a Call for Advice on two delegated acts under DORA. Also relating to DORA, the EBA has launched a consultation on the second package of draft RTS, ITS and guidelines, covering topics such as incident reporting, penetration testing and oversight cooperation. 
The EBA
opens in a new tab
 and ESMA
opens in a new tab
 continue to consult on standards and guidelines to support the Markets in Cryptoassets Act (MiCA). ESMA
opens in a new tab
 simultaneously called on Member States to begin designating relevant regulators and to consider limiting the optional grand-fathering period available within the MiCA framework. Provisional agreement has now been reached on the EU AI Act — meaning that work can continue at the technical level in the coming weeks to finalise the details of the new regulation.

Looking forward

2024 will be an election year it the EU, resulting in changes to the composition of the European Parliament and Commission. The EU authorities therefore seem keen to progress files as much as possible now, with regulatory activity likely to slow as we approach the middle of next year.

Welcome to the latest edition of European Regulatory Radar 
The new issue of European Regulatory Radar brings you the latest updates impacting financial services providers in the region. Complementing the UK Regulatory Radar series, European Regulatory Radar provides an overview of the wider economic and political environment, progress across the regulatory agenda and deep-dive articles on some of the most important regulatory developments.

The wider economic and political environment

The EBA's annual risk assessment
opens in a new tab
 found that the banking sector remains resilient despite pockets of risk stemming from the change in interest rates. This sentiment was largely reiterated in its quarterly risk dashboard
opens in a new tab
. 
EIOPA has published its own risk dashboard
opens in a new tab
 showing that exposure to market risk remains the main concern for insurers. Macro and digitalisation risks are still relevant but have decreased to medium levels compared to our last edition. 
In its January Trends, Risks and Vulnerabilities report
opens in a new tab
 (1.35 MB), ESMA noted that financial markets have remained 'remarkably resilient' despite the confluence of risks that prevailed throughout the year. Going forward, these risks are expected to persist. ESMA has also published a report
opens in a new tab
 on the EU's alternative investment funds market, highlighting potential risks in funds exposed to leverage and liquidity mismatches. 
To address heightened risks, the Commission has completed a review
opens in a new tab
 of the existing macroprudential framework. Based on this, it plans to focus on revising and simplifying the regime for banks, while considering more fundamental changes for non-banks (including through further consultations later this year).

Progressing the regulatory agenda

Supervisory priorities continue to evolve. This quarter, the ECB updated its 2024-2026 priorities
opens in a new tab
 (see more in the deep dive article below) and EIOPA published its 2024 supervisory convergence plan
opens in a new tab
.
At the same time, new policy initiatives are being finalised at pace ahead of the European Parliament elections in June.
In the banking sector, the Commission has published the agreed text
opens in a new tab
 for the final elements of Basel III implementation and confirmed that these rules will apply from 1 January 2025. The EBA simultaneously published an implementation roadmap
opens in a new tab
, to clarify how it will develop the mandates underpinning the legislation. Some initial draft mandates
opens in a new tab
 have already been issued on operational risk, with consultation deadlines in April and May.
Provisional political agreement
opens in a new tab
 has also been reached on the 'Daisy Chains' proposal of targeted amendments to the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD) and the Single Resolution Mechanism Regulation (SRMR).
The ECB has issued its revised guide
opens in a new tab
 (PDF 2.87) to internal models with key revisions relating to climate-related risks, detailed requirements for common definitions of default, counterparty credit risk, default risk in the trading book and how to return to a standardised approach. The ECB has also announced that in 2024 it will conduct a cyber resilience stress test on 109 directly supervised banks. This will assess how banks respond to and recover from a cyberattack, rather than their ability to prevent one.
And MEPs have adopted new rules within the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) to ensure transferred funds arrive in retail bank accounts within ten seconds. 
In insurance, EIOPA has launched a consultation
opens in a new tab
 on a proposed methodology for setting value-for-money benchmarks for unit-linked and hybrid insurance products. EIOPA is also consulting
opens in a new tab
 on the prudential treatment of sustainability risks. Meanwhile, the European Commission is requesting feedback
opens in a new tab
 on extending provisional equivalence on the solvency regime in force in the United States for a period of 10 years (from January 2026). 
The proposed Retail Investment Strategy that would impact firms in the wider retail investments ecosystem remains subject to ongoing debate and negotiation, with the shape of the final package still unclear.
In capital markets, regulation on the European Single Access Point (ESAP) came into force in January. This will consolidate access to public financial and non-financial information about EU companies and EU investment products. The ESAs have begun consulting on their associated technical standards. 
Significantly, political agreement
opens in a new tab
 has been reached on the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR) 3.0 package, aiming to make EU clearing safer and more attractive while mitigating risks from excessive reliance on central counterparties (CCPs) located in third countries. Although the exact detail is yet to be clarified, the threat of considerable amounts of EU clearing being forced from UK CCPs into EU CCPs has lessened. This has been welcomed by clearing members.
The MiFIR review has been published in the Official Journal. It will help establish EU-level consolidated tapes, phase out 'payment for order flow' (PFOF) by 30 June 2026 and introduce new rules on commodity derivatives.
For asset managers, after lengthy negotiations, the Council and Parliament approved revisions to the AIFMD and UCITS Directive under the AIFMD II package (see more detail in our deep dive this issue). ESMA also published draft technical standards
opens in a new tab
 under the revised European Long Term Investment Fund (ELTIF) regulation and submitted these to the Commission for approval. However, the Commission has responded to ESMA, stating it plans to adopt the RTS but with amendments to make some of the requirements more proportionate (e.g. around notice periods and liquidity management tools).
EU fund managers will also be interested in progress made on the FCA's Overseas Funds Regime, with the UK government announcing
opens in a new tab
 it had deemed the EEA to be equivalent, and the FCA concluding its consultation
opens in a new tab
.
The EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) became applicable on 1 January, with the first wave of reporting against the 12 European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) due in 2025. 
Provisional agreement
opens in a new tab
 has been reached over a new regulatory regime for ESG rating providers. As part of the agreement, the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) has been amended, leaving asset managers and advisers with new disclosure obligations relating to the methodology used for ESG ratings under certain circumstances. More broadly, the future direction of the SFDR is now uncertain, given that the Commission is unlikely to adopt the ESAs' proposed changes to the more detailed standards under its current mandate, and feedback is awaited on more fundamental changes proposed by the Commission to the level one text. For asset managers, ESMA also provided an update (PDF 65.7 KB) on its proposed guidelines for fund managers. 
Despite several rounds of negotiation, Member States voted against the final proposals for the EU Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive, which would establish formal requirements to adopt human rights and environmental due diligence policies and implement relevant processes in risk management systems. Given the upcoming EU elections, the current stand-off may result in significant delays to implementation of the directive. 
The Commission has adopted
opens in a new tab
 two delegated acts under the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) and four delegated acts under the Regulation on Markets in Cryptoassets (MiCA). If no objections are raised by Parliament and the Council, the acts will start applying after the review period has elapsed. Three new regulatory technical standards (RTS) have also been adopted under DORA.
Political agreement
opens in a new tab
 has been reached on the AI Act. The Act will now formally pass through each legislative body (expected imminently), after which it will become the first AI law by a major jurisdiction. Political agreement
opens in a new tab
 has also been reached on establishing an Anti-Money Laundering Authority (AMLA) in Frankfurt
opens in a new tab
.

Looking forward

The upcoming EU elections will result in changes to the composition of the European Parliament and Commission. EU authorities are now running out of time to finalise remaining files before activity begins to slow towards the summer months.

WHY THIS MATTERS
Individuals who have accounts in financial institutions in Ukraine should be aware that their home jurisdiction’s authorities can be notified of their tax residency and vice versa.
Ukrainian tax authorities may contact Ukrainian tax residents with foreign financial accounts shortly after the exchange of information takes place, and may request that such individuals submit an annual tax return and to report foreign assets and income (if they have not done so), or provide an explanation as to why the reporting of their assets and income is not required.

More Details
The State Tax Service of Ukraine joined the Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement on the Automatic Exchange of Information on Financial Accounts (hereinafter, “Multilateral agreement CRS”) on 19 August 2022.
After a positive evaluation conducted by the OECD Global Forum in respect of information security of the State Tax Service, the Multilateral agreement CRS entered into force for Ukraine on 28 June 2024.3
According to provisions of the Multilateral agreement CRS, information exchange is to be carried out within nine months after the end of the calendar year to which the information relates (i.e., until 30 September).
The information exchanged includes the account-holder’s:
- name, date, place of birth, address, and tax identification numbers,
- account number(s), and
- account balance(s) or value as of the end of the relevant reporting period.

KPMG INSIGHTS
The State Tax Service of Ukraine sent information to more than 30 foreign jurisdictions and received information from more than 50 foreign jurisdictions, according to results of the information exchange CRS.4  
If Ukrainian assignees who are tax resident in a foreign jurisdiction with financial accounts in that jurisdiction or foreign national assignees who are tax resident in Ukraine with financial accounts in Ukraine have questions or concerns, they should contact their usual global mobility services provider or a member of the GMS/tax team with KPMG in Ukraine (see the Contacts section).

The upcoming launch of ETA marks a significant enhancement of the country’s immigration process.

WHY THIS MATTERS
By integrating with existing e-Visa services, ETA will modernize the tracking of foreign nationals and streamline immigration through a single online platform.  This initiative aims to reduce manual paperwork, strengthen security protocols, and accelerate immigration clearance at automated passport gates, potentially helping to ensure a faster and more efficient experience for visa-exempt travelers.

More DetailsThailand’s Electronic Travel Authorization (ETA) System
Thailand’s ETA system, launching in December 2024, will be mandatory for all visa-exempt travelers arriving by air, land, or sea.  Eligible travelers from 93 countries must apply for an ETA online before arrival.  The system allows a single entry for up to 60 days, with an optional 30-day extension.
Key Features:
Mandatory for visa-exempt travelers – applies to air, land, and sea entries (travelers applying for a tourist visa, visa-on-arrival, or any other types of visas will not need to apply).
Online application – accessible through the existing e-Visa platform, with a QR code issued upon successful application.
Automated immigration gates – QR codes expedite entry via automated gates at Thai border points.
Objectives:
Enhance foreign national tracking, and improve border security through a pre-screening procedure.
Streamline immigration procedures, and reduce paperwork and administrative burdens.
Integrate ETA with the e-Visa platform.
Speed up immigration processing at automated gates.
Thailand’s ETA System: Further Developments
As of December 2024, the ETA requirements will be enforced for visa-exempt travelers; however current immigration procedures will remain in place.  Please be aware that ETA approval does not guarantee entry – that ultimate decision is for the border officials to make, who may deny entry if deemed necessary.

KPMG INSIGHTS
We advise travelers to regularly check the Ministry of Foreign Affairs website for updates on the ETA system, and any relevant press releases published by the Thai government.2,3
Questions about eligibility, securing the appropriate documentation to support applications, making applications, and the next steps forward, may be directed to the traveler’s usual immigration counsel or to a member of our Immigration team at KPMG in Thailand (see the Contact Us section).).

During the transition period at the ministry, it is possible that changes will take place in terms of certain administrative aspects of the application process – for example, applications for work and residence permits for highly-qualified workers (“PAC” in Spanish), intra-company transfers (ICT), and their dependent family members (amongst others) – and as such, it is possible that applicants (or those filing applications on their behalf) will experience variations in requirements in respect of certain usual application procedures.
KPMG strives to be up-to-date with any such changes and to keep our clients and readers of GMS Flash Alert duly informed.

WHY THIS MATTERS 
Any change in criteria could potentially affect:
the preliminary analysis that is part of the assessment of the viability of cases,
the determination of the appropriate strategy for incorporating employees into Spain and at their employers, as well as
the consideration of feasible timelines for the review/approval process to be completed.
Employers and their employees (as well as their professional services advisers) may encounter difficulties if unexpected changes occur.  They should be prepared for contingencies.

KPMG INSIGHTS
This GMS Flash Alert aims to make readers aware of changes taking place in Spain currently under the remit of the Ministerio de Inclusión, Seguridad Social y Migraciones and the support KPMG in Spain intends to provide where necessary.  Affected parties who may be seeing a change in the processing of their applications should contact their usual immigration adviser or a member of the Immigration team with KPMG in Spain (see the Contacts section) for individualised support.
KPMG in Spain continues to monitor the processes around the filing and review of applications and will endeavour to communicate any officially-confirmed changes to application-related criteria to GMS Flash Alert readers.

https://kpmg.com/xx/en/our-insights/esg/asia-pacifics-energy-transition-how-fast-and-how-far-can-it-go.html,ESG,Asia Pacific’s energy transition: How fast—and how far—can it go?,,"The energy sector is a major driver of global warming, contributing three-quarters of total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions globally.1 As such, efforts to decarbonize the sector have naturally risen to the top of the agenda for almost all governments and corporates as they strive to meet their climate goals.
The environmental impacts of the energy sector may worsen further, given the accelerated adoption of energy-intensive technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), data centers and block chain technologies, all of which are contributing to increased demand for electricity. The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that these technologies could double their electricity consumption by 2026, roughly equivalent to Japan’s annual energy usage.2
Such outsized demand could lead to increased dependence on fossil fuels-based power production as clean energy sources lack the scale needed to match the pace of increases in energy requirements. As per the Energy Institute’s Statistical Review of World Energy 2024—written with the support of KPMG—the growth of renewable energy consumption and electricity demand are outpacing total primary energy production.3 And despite renewables claiming ever larger portions of total energy consumption, the world’s energy-related emissions exceeded 40 GtCO2 for the very first time in 2023.4

The transition imperative

Decarbonizing the energy sector is crucial to meeting Asia Pacific’s net-zero targets, and there has been encouraging progress on this front.  
Across ASEAN, governments are setting ambitious decarbonization goals aimed at expanding renewables’ share in their energy mix. These national net-zero commitments could address as much as 61 percent of the region’s GHG emissions.5
Mounting regulatory and consumer pressures are also fueling an acceleration in the energy transition. KPMG data reveals that 75 percent of consumers in Asia Pacific see climate change as a serious threat and want more access to renewable energy, underscoring the imperatives for power companies to initiate more investment and action.6
For businesses, embarking on the energy transition isn’t just about meeting new requirements from regulators and consumers—it’s also an opportunity to leverage new avenues for growth. An effective energy transition requires firms to take stock of their operations and identify areas for improvement. That could catalyze a total reimagination of their business potential and result in improved efficiencies, lower costs, enhance competitive advantage and develop new business models.

The state of the transition

Asia Pacific’s energy transition is underway, with renewable energy investment growing at an annual rate of 34 percent since 2004. In 2022, Asia Pacific’s economies invested much as US$345 billion into renewable energy production—much of it in China and India.7 That means that the region now accounts for nearly half of the world’s total renewables production capacity, producing 4,141.7 terra-watt hours in 2023.8
Driving the region’s renewables momentum is a combination of technological improvement, cost reduction and government support. Just as solar PV cell prices have plummeted by almost 95 percent per unit over the last decade, similar technological innovation and economies of scale are expected to play across other clean energy technologies like wind power generation and batteries for energy storage. Transport sector decarbonization is being led by increased EV penetration across markets led by China. The cost of EVs is heading towards parity with internal combustion engine vehicles —or becoming even lower—as battery technology improves and lowers production costs.9,10
Green data centers are increasingly becoming the norm, reflecting strong environmental commitments by technology companies as well as proactive consumer demand for sustainable services. RE100 commitments by corporations are creating demand for commercial and industrial (C&I) solar providers. C&I solar platforms directly supply renewable energy to customers who are unable to source green energy from the grid. Solar C&I is expected to be key driver of energy decarbonization in the short-to-medium term in countries like Singapore and Indonesia.11

Challenges to phasing down fossil fuels

Despite these undeniable successes, the energy transition is “off-track” to meet the goals set out in the 2015 Paris Agreement.12
In the wake of COP28, two key recommendations were identified to reduce the transition gap within the next five to 10 years: tripling renewable energy generation and doubling energy efficiency.13
Asia Pacific’s installed renewables capacity is expected to almost double by 2028 compared to 2022 levels.14 But at the same time, power players face challenges in building up infrastructure to manage the intermittent nature of renewables. For example, the solar capacity of today's grids maxes out at 20-25 percent—going beyond that would require significant investment in transmission, distribution and grid strengthening, as well as new forms of storage, such as batteries or green hydrogen.
Perhaps the most underappreciated part of the energy transition is the need to green power demand through improvements in energy efficiency, the “first fuel” that is one of the fastest and most cost-effective emissions mitigation tools.15 Improving energy efficiency will be key in energy-intensive sectors like petrochemicals, process industries and pharmaceuticals, helping avoid the impact of rising energy demand while lowering energy bills.
To drive the momentum for a phase-down of fossil fuels, the world will need to make progress on both the demand (energy efficiency improvement) and supply (renewable energy production) sides.
Coal remains Asia’s predominant source of energy because it’s easily accessible and cheap. As such, large-scale retirement of fossil-fuel plants can happen only if continuous access to green energy can be ensured by mainstreaming storage technologies and lowering their costs significantly.

Three levers driving the energy transition

Overcoming these limitations may be complicated by today’s challenging economic realities, but the success of the energy transition ultimately depends on whether companies understand how they can drive a calibrated approach towards green energy adoption, and that the technologies and funding they need are readily available.
To realize this, organizations and governments have three main levers at their disposal.
First, government policy, which plays an important role in motivating those in energy-intensive businesses, with sticks—like Singapore’s new carbon tax regime—or carrots in the form of incentives and grants that help cut the costs for companies to adopt green fuels and energy-optimized service delivery. 
Second, there is a need to address companies’ knowledge and skills gaps, especially in terms of their understanding of technologies that can support their transition. This requires the participation of organizations like industry associations or government agencies to provide training, share used cases and sector-specific information that companies can use to craft their energy transition roadmaps.  
And third, given the high costs associated with the energy transition, access to funding is non-negotiable to stabilize crucial technologies. The IEA estimates that emerging more than US$1 trillion of investment will be needed in emerging and developing economies by the end of the 2020s to meet net-zero goals.16
Luckily, the pot of funding available for sustainable green projects is large and diverse, fueled by commercial banks, financial institutions, multilateral organizations and philanthropic foundations. Between 2020-2023, governments have allocated US$1.34 trillion towards the green transition, while appetite among private investors for clean energy projects remains strong.17 In 2023, US$1.7 trillion of funding was available for energy transition projects—a 17% increase from the previous year—with investors primarily focused on EVs and renewable energy production.18 Capital is also flowing in from multilateral and development organizations, such as the Asian Development Bank, which has earmarked US$50 million towards accelerating the region’s energy transition.19
Ultimately, making full energy transition a reality depends on collaboration across all sectors. Collaborative projects shall be needed to support certain segments such as small-and-medium-sized businesses (SMEs) for whom the transition may be especially difficult. In partnership with the Monetary Authority of Singapore and several local banks, KPMG in Singapore developed Project Greenprint, an initiative aimed at onboarding SMEs’ sustainability data into a blockchain-powered database to support their decarbonization road mapping and access to green financing.20
There is also potential for initiatives to matchmake sustainability projects with available funding or technology providers to make an impact. The KPMG ASEAN Decarbonization Hub, for example, is designed to act as a platform to bring different energy transition stakeholders to connect with one another and innovate solutions.21

Looking ahead

The years leading up to 2030 are likely to be the most important to the success of the energy transition. The technologies and solutions that sit at the heart of the movement should already have been identified and mainstreamed within the next two to three years so the transition can begin to take hold.
Today, the energy transition agenda has entered the mainstream; people understand it, appreciate it, and are working towards it. The big question now is how fast—and how far—can it go?

https://kpmg.com/xx/en/our-insights/transformation/what-non-eu-companies-need-to-know-about-the-recently-passed-eu-ai-act.html,Transformation,What non-EU companies need to know about the recently passed EU AI Act,,"The European Union (EU) recently passed the EU Artificial Intelligence Act (EU AI Act) with the intent of creating coherent and responsible rules governing the use of AI. As with privacy and data regulation under the rules known as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the EU appears to hope that this initial framework will provide a global precedent for AI regulation. While the EU AI Act primarily applies to organizations directly involved in the creation and deployment of AI systems in the EU, it also applies to organizations that sell, import, distribute or plan for their AI products to be used inside the EU.
In other words, the EU AI Act applies to non-EU-based organizations if their AI tools will find their way into the EU. Therefore, any organization which has a business connection to the EU should have a comprehensive understanding of these rules and how these rules affect them currently and in the future.
Generative AI tools are being rapidly developed and deployed; almost every organization is trying to determine how best to utilize AI systems to enhance their strategic business goals. As global organizations begin to integrate AI into their business models, they should understand and respond to existing and developing global regulations. Integrating AI systems and understanding EU and other regulations should be conducted simultaneously to help ensure that the correct tools are being utilized for a business’s needs, while at the same time adhering to an evolving regulatory landscape.

What types of organizations and activities are covered?

While there will certainly be additional clarification in the coming years around the implementation of the EU AI Act, in the meantime, it provides useful guidelines for global organizations concerning risk allocation and AI adoption.

Who is covered?

No one would be surprised to find out that major high-tech companies that are developing their own AI systems are the primary object of these new rules. However, under the EU AI Act, these new regulations apply to providers, manufacturers, importers, distributors, and deployers of AI systems. Many non-tech organizations that use AI will most likely find themselves falling under the definition of a “deployer”, which is defined broadly by the Act as “any natural or legal person…using an AI system under its authority…” In addition, the EU AI Act applies to providers and deployers of AI systems that are established outside the EU “to the extent the output produced by those systems is intended to be used in the Union.” An example of this might be using a global organization based in the UK using an AI system created in the US to draft a contract sent to an EU entity. This type of activity will be regulated by the EU AI Act. Organizations with a global business model should be fluent in the EU AI Act’s requirements.

What types of activities are covered?

The EU AI Act creates a multi-tiered risk system that ranges from “unacceptable risk” to “minimal risk”. Certain other activities are also explicitly regulated, such as requiring that all artificially generated or manipulated multimedia content be explicitly labeled. 
Unacceptable risk
Certain AI systems that are perceived as a clear threat to the safety, livelihood, and rights of individuals pose an unacceptable risk and will be prohibited. Prohibited AI systems and processes currently include those that manipulate behavior, scrape untargeted facial images or target individuals based on certain behaviors, socioeconomic factors or stereotypes. (There may be some law enforcement exceptions for the use of biometric identification). An example of a prohibited system is one that would use race to predict behavior. 
High risk
This category focuses on how AI is utilized in certain products. High-risk products might include medical devices, aviation-related security products and certain automotive products. The EU AI Act provides additional guidance by describing certain high-risk use cases. For example, it would be considered high-risk to use AI in biometric identification systems, credit-worthiness evaluations, and certain HR situations. According to the EU AI Act, anyone utilizing high-risk products needs to take certain precautions, including developing a risk management system that incorporates data governance, documentation and transparency rules.
Limited Risk
AI systems that do not pose a “high” or “unacceptable” risk under the EU AI Act, but which do interact with individuals, are subject to limited transparency obligations. An example of a limited risk AI interaction could include a conversation with a chatbot. 
Minimal or no risk
An AI system that does not fall into any of the above risk categories is deemed to pose only a minimal or non-existent risk, and therefore is not subject to the regulations of the EU AI Act. However, it is possible that privacy or other laws may still apply to these AI interactions.

What are the consequences?

The newly created EU AI Office will oversee the implementation and enforcement of the EU AI Act. The consequences for noncompliance are significant. Depending on the violation and the organization’s revenues, fines can range from to €7.5 million or 1.5 percent of global revenue to €35 million or 7 percent of global revenue.

Next steps

As you develop your AI strategy, it is important to do so with the understanding that the EU AI Act is likely to provide a blueprint for future compliance rules. While non-EU countries are likely to develop their own independent sets of regulations, organizations should both understand the EU rules and develop an elastic framework that can quickly respond to this rapidly evolving technology. The EU AI Act becomes law 20 days after publication in the Official Journal of EU, which occurred on May 21, 2024. Most of its provisions will become applicable two years after the EU AI Act’s official enactment. Obviously, the state of AI may change dramatically in the next two years. However, there are certain basic steps that can be taken now to help ensure that your organization can more easily respond to the EU AI Act, any additional rules, and any changes in the AI landscape.
Now that the basic framework of the EU Act is in place, it is a good idea to develop a compliance AI strategy, in addition to a business-focused AI strategy. In other words, AI compliance should be integrated into your AI strategy.
The first step should be a thorough analysis of the current state of your organization’s AI systems. What types of AI are you using and what types are you planning to use in the near future? You should have a solid understanding of your organization’s AI strategy and how it supports your business needs and how it might evolve over time. You should understand how your AI is being used by all constituents in your organization. Do you have international branches or customers? Obviously, large multinational organizations that are early adopters of AI will require a comprehensive understanding of how their AI systems are being used and what risk categories their AI systems fall into. Assessing your AI systems and strategies and their corresponding risk profiles is the first step.

Next, it is advisable to set up a formal governance system. There should be a devoted team of senior employees who are responsible for constantly monitoring how AI is being used, especially as new AI systems and AI processes and products are being introduced. This group should be tasked with staying updated on all global AI rules, as well as any domestic AI regulations and interpretations to existing rules. Organization-wide education should be part of this governance system. All employees with access to any AI system used (including an AI system that is created by a third party) should understand how the system works, what restrictions are in place and how to use it in a way that complies with both government and organizational rules. Organizations are also advised to create an in-house hotline where questions can be answered. In addition, there should be a process in place to deal with any violations that have occurred. This process can mimic any process that the organization has established to track and deal with any other type of intentional or unintentional misconduct. 

A monitoring system should be established. Organizations should create a meaningful set of key performance indicators (KPIs) that help to evaluate if all elements of their governance system are working. Do employees understand how AI is being used? When a customer or division in a new jurisdiction with additional or different rules is added, is the AI system quickly able to adapt to that jurisdiction’s requirements? Are violations being addressed and reported promptly? Are the key employees updated on any new rules in a timely basis, and is there an internal and/or external team available to help answer AI-related compliance questions?

It is imperative that organizations design and monitor processes to help ensure that they are complying with all applicable laws, including the newly enacted EU AI Act. However, organizations should also consider taking an additional step and seek to develop internal guidelines that go beyond meeting the minimum compliance requirements. Ideally, organizations should seek to become model citizens when it comes to using AI systems; they should seek to develop the most ethical set of internal rules. By taking a stand as a leader in ethical AI usage, organizations have the chance to distinguish themselves as leaders in an area where uncertainty is a defining factor and public distrust is a serious concern.

Conclusion

Understandably, multinational organizations are eager to take advantage of AI tools and the business breakthroughs that they offer. The EU AI Act makes it clear that new rules and regulations have been instituted and it is likely that additional legal requirements will be enacted by many other jurisdictions. Organizations are advised to utilize the newly enacted EU AI Act as a useful blueprint to start creating internal systems to not only ensure they are following the EU AI Act’s guidance but are also developing internal systems that can quickly respond to any new rules that arise. As the use of AI is relatively new in a business context, organizations can develop their own innovative systems that create systems that are not only compliant but also optimal.

Decree No. 501/2024 came into force from 2 September 2024, and further phases will follow.  The Decree is part of the government’s ongoing strategy to enhance local employment opportunities in line with the country’s “Omanisation3” goals.  Various professions including marketing specialists, systems analysts, mechanical technicians – among others – are impacted by the Decree.

WHY THIS MATTERS
Employers may wish to consider the possible implications of the restrictions to certain professions for their current and future workforce.  Employers need to be aware of the roles which are reserved for Omani nationals under law so that they can (re)structure their recruitment strategies accordingly and comply with the new legislation.

More Details
Under the Decree, in addition to the pre-exisiting list of restricted professions, the following professions will be restricted for expatriates:
From 2 September 2024, the majority of the restricted professions came into force and they include marketing specialists, quality control officers, mechanical and electrical technicians, sales representatives, and commercial brokers.
Effective 1 January 2025: systems analysts/generals, information systems network specialists, marine controllers, ship traffic controllers, and computer maintenance technicians.
Effective 1 January 2026: computer programmers, electronic computer engineers, and computer operators.
Effective 1 January 2027: web designers and operations analysts.

KPMG INSIGHTS
Employers and employees who are concerned about the restricted occupations and wish to consult on appropriate next steps should consider contacting their usual employment law or immigration counsel or a member of the global-mobility services team at KPMG in Oman (see the Contacts section).

The globally connected and increasingly digital financial landscape is transforming the banking industry, creating opportunities for growth and innovation.
Corporate cash management is a growing market and is primed for further growth as both established transaction banking players and new entrants vie for market share. However, technological advances are allowing new entrants to compete with traditional transaction banks through differentiation and customer focus.
Given the sophisticated tech solutions that corporates are now looking for, the battle for market share of corporate cash management is intensifying. 
This paper highlights some of the key trends and market potential KPMG professionals are seeing and reflects some of the conversations with corporate clients about their changing needs.

Market outlook: Growing opportunities, greater competition

Corporate cash management is a growing market that’s on an upward trajectory. Based on KPMG market research, global transaction banking revenue is over US$1.4 trillion while the corporate cash management market is projected to grow steadily in the coming years, driven by increased demand for efficient cash flow management solutions.
Large traditional transaction banks are investing in new and advanced capabilities to increase their corporate cash management market share. Competitors, including de novo banks and new entrants, are competing with traditional transaction banks through differentiation and customer focus. This is enabled and accelerated by modern technology stacks that can leapfrog incumbents burdened with legacy systems’ technical debt to provide differentiated offerings.
Why the surge in interest and investment? Corporates are open to change and are scrutinizing their banking relationships with unprecedented intensity. KPMG research indicates that 72% of large corporates are reviewing banking relationships at any one time.1
As Courtney H. Trimble, Principal – Lead of Global Payments, KPMG in the US, explains, “We're talking about a robust and growing market that’s seen as a growth engine for banks – there’s an arms race for market share. New entrants and de novos are entering the market by investing in innovative and robust capabilities. Traditional banks are also investing heavily to counter this and to protect and grow their customer base.”
Banks that can offer superior – and industry-specific – corporate cash management services stand to gain a larger slice of the transaction banking pie. The shift is evident in how organizations are managing their cash and banking relationships. According to the Association for Financial Professionals (AFP) Liquidity Survey 2024, 45 percent of organizations moved deposits from regional banks to larger banks in response to the 2023 banking crisis. While 35 percent of companies spread their deposits among a greater number of banks to further reduce risk.2
There's heightened awareness of risk management and the growing importance of diversification in banking relationships. In turn, this is creating inroads for banks that can demonstrate stability and offer comprehensive transaction banking services.

New client expectations: The bar is rising

Today's corporate clients demand more from transaction banking. In this dynamic market, these raised expectations are creating new opportunities to provide differentiated products and services.
A good measure to track corporate treasurer’s overall satisfaction with their bank’s cash management capabilities is to look at whether they are actively reviewing their banking partner relationships. KPMG in the US analysis shows that 72 percent of large corporates are reviewing and the top three bank products under review are:
Cash management services – including front-end digital channels, connectivity, and onboarding
Liquidity solutions
Payments
Banks regularly use multiple cash management partners. With corporate treasurers actively reviewing their banking partner relationships, there is an opportunity to gain entry with the right offerings and value proposition.

Leading practices in the future of cash management

In this increasingly competitive landscape, certain trends are emerging as the most powerful go-to-market strategies – both for existing players and new entrants.
Courtney Trimble comments, “The investment themes we're seeing are consistent across the board and focus on providing differentiated offerings and capabilities and being easy to do business with”. 
Key investment themes

KPMG firms’ experience has shown that banks which successfully implement these trends and strategies can significantly improve their transaction banking growth and client retention. By focusing on technology-driven solutions and client-centric approaches, banks can gain a competitive edge.

Case Study: Global cash management strategy for a top 10 global bank

KPMG in the US supported a top 10 global transaction bank with the development of a single global cash management product strategy and operating model across all global jurisdictions. The Bank had disparate capabilities and offerings across their Americas, EMEA, and APAC regions and were looking to streamline and develop a unified global strategy while addressing the competitive landscape and a range of corporate client needs to determine incremental go-forward priority global product offerings.
KPMG in the US baselined cash management product capabilities across all regions and evaluated client needs, product priorities, and the competitor landscape. The US firm then drove regional prioritization and standardization of existing and target product capabilities and developed a standard global cash management taxonomy. Lastly, a phased innovation roadmap and global organizational operating structure were developed. As a result, the bank streamlined its cash management offerings globally, enhanced its product portfolio, and significantly improved its competitive position in the transaction banking market.

Product offering and capabilities

To meet diverse client needs with the right products – across industries and geographies – transaction banks should develop a range of product offering capabilities. While transaction banks should provide foundational capabilities to meet minimum client expectations, differentiated and industry-specific products and services are key for enabling new entrants to gain market share. The same goes for traditional players as they look to effectively address client needs and support future business growth:

Case Study: De novo US corporate cash management strategy

A leading Canadian bank was looking to enter the US corporate cash management market but faced challenges in understanding the new market dynamics and competitor landscape. The bank needed to identify opportunities for differentiation and develop a strategy that leveraged its strengths while addressing market demands.
Working together, KPMG in the US and KPMG Canada supported the Bank with a GTM strategy, inclusive of industry insights, competitor analysis, and client needs assessment. Foundational, differentiated, and industry-specific product offerings and corresponding technology capabilities were defined. A strategic roadmap with quick wins and long-term initiatives along with corresponding operating model business cases were developed to support the successful entry into the US market.

Operating model considerations: Building for success

Beyond basic capabilities, banks are looking to up-tier into those differentiating and industry-specific solutions to really compete.
Creating a winning transaction banking business requires careful consideration of several factors from strategy through delivery. The following overarching operating model considerations apply both to new entrants as well as traditional players looking to enhance their existing capabilities:

Case Study: Instant payments platform implementation for a top 10 global bank's US subsidiary

The US subsidiary of a top 10 global transaction bank was looking to implement Real-Time Payments (RTP) capabilities to stay competitive in the evolving payments landscape. KPMG in the US worked to develop the Bank’s overarching enterprise payments strategy, followed by performing a payments platform vendor evaluation across RTP, high value wires, and low value automated clearing house (ACH) to help the Bank select their payments platform for instant payments as well as future payment types.
KPMG in the US then supported the implementation from detailed requirements definition and vendor fit-gap to implementation planning, solution design, platform configuration, testing, and operational readiness. This turnkey approach enabled the bank to successfully launch RTP capabilities, enhancing its transaction banking offering and providing its corporate clients with a new instant payment type.

Conclusion: Tomorrow’s transaction banking, today

The transaction banking landscape is rapidly evolving, driven by corporate clients' increasing demand for digitalization, real-time insights, and advanced cash management capabilities.

Corporates are seeking more customized solutions to meet their complex business needs. This shift presents a significant opportunity for banks to reassess and enhance their corporate cash management capabilities. These are being enabled by modern technology stacks that provide differentiated corporate cash management offerings, allowing banks to compete effectively and gain market share.
Key trends like digitization and automation, seamless client experience and connectivity, real-time data access, and advanced liquidity tools are reshaping the transaction banking industry. KPMG's expertise in these areas is there to guide banks through this transformation, helping them develop winning strategies that align with these emerging trends. Banks that successfully deliver differentiated cash management solutions and services will lead in the increasingly competitive transaction banking market.

https://kpmg.com/xx/en/our-insights/value-creation/deposit-tokens-bridging-traditional-banking-and-the-digital-economy.html,Value Creation,Deposit Tokens: Bridging Traditional Banking and the Digital Economy,,"This article explores deposit tokens and tokenized deposits in banking, as a bridge between traditional finance and the digital economy. It examines the potential benefits, challenges, and use cases of tokenization for commercial banks, highlighting KPMG firms’ role in providing advice and support to financial institutions on this journey. By embracing tokenization, banks can enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and unlock new revenue streams.

Technologies are reshaping the concept of money and assets in a digital world. For commercial banks, the pace of change brings opportunities and formidable challenges just to keep in step with digital innovation. One area gaining traction is tokenization – the World Economic Forum expects 10 percent of global GDP to be tokenized by 20271. Tokenized deposits are a potential bridge between traditional banking systems and the tokenized economy.
This article focuses on the potential impact on finance and banking. It seeks to highlight the potential benefits, challenges, use cases, predictions and actions for banks. Plus, KPMG firms’ knowledge and experience – across advisory, deals, audit and tax.
As Debarshi Bandyopadhyay, Director, Blockchain/Crypto Financial Services Advisory, KPMG in Singapore highlights, “KPMG firms digital asset solutions can help banks on their Web2 to Web3 journeys – building the technology capabilities and operating model to take advantage of the upward trend for tokenized assets in an increasingly digital financial ecosystem.”

Understanding digital money and tokenization

Digital money is any form of monetary value that exists in electronic form. This includes emerging forms of money like central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), regulated stablecoins and tokenized commercial bank money also known as tokenized deposits (or deposit tokens). Key characteristics of digital money are that they can be transferred and stored electronically and programmed using smart contracts.
Tokenization, on the other hand, is converting rights to an asset into a digital token on a blockchain (or other distributed ledger technology). This can apply to any asset, from real estate and artwork to stocks and bonds. The main reasons behind interest in tokenization are the potential benefits of increased liquidity, faster and cheaper transactions, and improved transparency.
According to KPMG in Singapore’s research, the potential to tokenize global illiquid assets, spanning across real estate, private equity, bonds, commodities, and financial assets, represents a multi-trillion- dollar opportunity. The forecasted market opportunity is expected to grow by 28 to 80 times from the 2023 baseline by 2030.2

Tokenized deposits explained

Tokenization of commercial bank money can be in the form of tokenized deposits or deposit tokens. Tokenized deposits are token representation of the commercial deposits where each token is backed by retail or institutional deposits. Whereas a deposit token is the native token on blockchain which directly represents the retail or institutional deposits in form of tokens.
Transferring tokenized deposits between banks as a form of payment requires settlement. This happens through a two-tier system mediated and interoperated by a central bank (generally using the wholesale CBDC or existing fiat-based RTGS system). In the case of transfer of deposit tokens, this is achieved by directly transferring the token from one bank to another which constitutes final settlement without the need for the two-tier model.
Both deposit tokens and tokenized deposits sit at the intersection of instant payments and tokenization. As digital representations of commercial bank money, they are issued by regulated financial institutions and backed by traditional fiat deposits. In essence, they bring the stability and trust associated with traditional banking into the world of blockchain and digital assets – while leveraging the stringent regulations that already govern banks today.
There are crucial differences that set tokenized deposits apart from other forms of digital money. Key characteristics include:
Issuer: Licensed depository institutions (banks)
Backing: Fully backed by fiat currency deposits at the issuing bank
Regulatory oversight: Subject to existing banking regulations
Technology: Issued and transacted on blockchain platforms or other distributed ledger technology (DLT)
Functionality: Programmable, enabling smart contract integration
It's important to distinguish tokenized deposits from other forms of digital money: 
Stablecoins: While also designed to maintain a stable value, stablecoins are also issued by non- bank entities and may have different backing mechanisms. In the UK and EU, stablecoins are gaining great traction where many institutions (and some banks) are in process of issuing their own stablecoins. In Singapore, two USD-backed stablecoins and one SGD-backed stablecoin have received in-principle approval under the Monetary Authority of Singapore’s (MAS) stablecoin framework. Furthermore, the SGD stablecoin has been utilized in Project Orchid, leveraging the programmability of digital money to distribute digital vouchers, primarily aimed at facilitating government social subsidy payments.
Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs): These are digital forms of fiat currency issued directly by central banks, not commercial banks.
As Debarshi Bandyopadhyay sums up, “Through tokenized deposits, banks can have the best of both worlds – where trust meets technology. They could be a powerful tool to remain competitive and relevant and there’s so much potential still to play out.”

The potential of tokenizing commercial bank money

KPMG's Tokenization Playbook highlights tokenization as a “transformative force, democratizing investment opportunities and streamlining investment processes.” So, what is the potential of tokenization for commercial banks? And the competitive advantages that could transform how banks operate and interact?

Trust and stability

Tokenization of commercial bank money and deposit tokens inherit the trust and regulatory oversight associated with traditional banking institutions. The KPMG Asset Tokenization C-Suite Playbook highlights the advantages versus other digital assets that lack this level of stability, assurance, and security.

Seamless integration

By representing traditional bank deposits in a tokenized form, these assets can integrate with both conventional financial systems and blockchain-based platforms. This integration potential is crucial for bringing together traditional finance and the emerging world of decentralized finance (DeFi).

Enhanced efficiency

Deposit tokens can facilitate faster, potentially 24/7 transactions, improving liquidity management and cutting settlement times. Tokenized deposits could dramatically reduce the time and cost of cross-border payments and complex financial transactions.

Programmability

Like other digital assets, tokenized deposits can be programmed with smart contracts, enabling automated, conditional transactions. This feature opens a world of possibilities for innovative financial products and services and for achieving ultra-efficient payments.
KPMG in Ireland's analysis suggests that asset tokenization goes beyond technological innovation by offering “the potential to transform how assets are traded and managed.”3 The long-term impact and full potential of deposit tokens are still being explored and will largely depend on regulatory developments and investment and adoption trends.

What’s happening now?

The focus of use cases is heavily on institutional banking. As Debarshi Bandyopadhyay points out, “Tokenization is on an upward trend. Without a high-volume, scalable commercial solution, deposit tokens are proving their worth in three areas – conditional payments, cross-border payments and securities settlements.”

Conditional payments

Deposit tokens can be programmed to execute payments only using smart contracts. This functionality creates new possibilities for automated, trustless transactions. For example:
Escrow services: In real estate, M&A and eCommerce transactions, funds can be held in tokenized form and automatically released to the seller once ownership or asset transfer is verified.
Supply chain finance: Payments to suppliers could be triggered automatically upon confirmation of goods delivery, streamlining the process and reducing delays.

Cross-border payments

Deposit tokens could improve efficiency and reduce the cost of global money transfers. Real- time settlement across different time zones is a key advantage, potentially cutting costs significantly and reducing settlement times from days to minutes:
Faster settlement: Enabling near-instantaneous settlement, even across different time zones.
Cost reduction: By eliminating intermediaries and reducing the need for currency conversion, deposit tokens could significantly lower transaction costs.
Transparency: Blockchain technology allows for real-time tracking of transactions, providing greater visibility into the payment process.

Securities settlement

In the realm of securities trading, deposit tokens could facilitate more efficient settlement processes:
Delivery vs. Payment (DvP): Enabling atomic settlement, where the exchange of securities and payment occurs simultaneously, reducing counterparty risk.
Fractional ownership: By tokenizing both the securities and the payment method, it becomes easier to enable fractional ownership of high-value assets.
24/7 trading: Unlike traditional markets with fixed trading hours, systems could potentially enable round-the-clock trading and settlement.
These use cases demonstrate how tokenization can address existing pain points in the financial system and spark new possibilities. As banks continue to explore and implement digital technology, even more innovative applications are likely to emerge.

Customer success: Real-time real estate

KPMG in Singapore developed a blockchain-based real estate marketplace for a client based in Fiji to address inefficiencies in land leasing. The platform includes a public marketplace, admin portal, surveyor portal, mobile voting for landowners, and analytics tools. It streamlines lease issuance, enhances transparency and security, simplifies land transactions, automates processes, and enables data-driven decisions. Plus, it ensures a fair, transparent valuation while protecting landowners' interests.

Customer success: Loyalty program takes off

KPMG in Singapore created a loyalty solution for a major airline, expanding their rewards ecosystem and built on blockchain. The blockchain platform allows customers to use miles for everyday spending globally. Plus, the platform is equipped to facilitate seamless interoperability between digital currencies, fiat money, and loyalty points, enabling payments to merchants. KPMG designed and developed the proof-of-concept in 10 weeks, then scaled it to production in 16 weeks. The team ran pilots, supported launch activities, and provided ongoing management. The solution enabled seamless transactions, easy merchant integration, and a great user experience on the loyalty app.

Predictions for 2025 and beyond: Asia Pacific’s accelerated adoption

KPMG’s Pulse of Fintech highlights that EMEA and ASPAC regions are focused more heavily on the development and launch of digital currencies and real-world digital asset tokenization than in the US.4 Asia Pacific adoption of tokenized deposits, driven by:
Regulatory support – Many countries and territories are creating regulatory environments for digital assets. Project Guardian5 in Singapore has three objectives: to formulate industry standards for asset tokenization on a commercial scale, to establish policy guidelines and frameworks, and to develop a sound and sustainable digital asset ecosystem. Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has been experimenting with CBDCs and tokenized deposits through its projects mBridge, Ensemble and eHKD+. Bank of International Settlement has launched the project Agora where private financial firms and Central banks will explore how tokenization can enhance wholesale cross-border payments
Cross-border trade – As a hub for international trade, the region stands to benefit significantly from the efficiencies deposit tokens offer in cross-border transactions.
Institutional interest – Major financial institutions in the region are already exploring and piloting projects. Project Guardian has 15 participating financial institutions.

Adoption actions for banks

To capitalize on the opportunities presented by tokenized deposits, banks should aim to:
1. Be fast followers
Establish dedicated teams to explore the technologies.
Engage in pilot projects, near-term use cases and proof-of-concepts by identifying which assets would most benefit from tokenization.
Participate in industry consortiums and regulatory sandboxes.
2. Think top-down
Inform and educate the C-suite on the potential to accelerate strategic goals.
Develop comprehensive business cases showing how tokenized deposits can coexist with and enhance traditional banking services.
Align tokenization strategies with overall digital transformation initiatives, particularly tech-stack requirements.
3. Embrace ecosystems
Foster partnerships with fintech companies, technology providers, and even other banks to create a minimal viable value chain for tokenized deposits.
Participate in the development of industry standards and collaborate with regulators to shape policy and future operating environments.
By taking these steps, banks can be best placed to take advantage of the upward trend towards tokenization and avoid playing catch-up as demand inevitably gathers pace.

Increasing cyber threats, such as ransomware and sophisticated Generative AI phishing attacks, are putting businesses at risk. To create resilience, organizations need to take a proactive, end-to-end approach to managing cyber risks, moving beyond static, siloed risk and compliance management.
Different industries have attempted this over the years, particularly in the areas of cyber security, business continuity, and disaster recovery, but the approach has been inconsistent and, in many cases, ineffective.
That’s why the European Union has introduced regulations such as the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) and the Network and Information Security Directive (NIS2) to combat the ever-present spectre of cyber disruption. This represents a challenge for the European finance industry, given both the broad scope and prescriptive nature of DORA.
In particular, DORA goes far beyond existing approaches to operational resilience, requiring financial services providers to take a holistic approach, break down existing data and process silos, and move from a more reactive stance to one that is both proactive and transparent.
Together, KPMG and ServiceNow can help your organization address these challenges. KPMG professionals have deep expertise in risk management and provide proven structured methodologies for addressing operational resilience, while ServiceNow offers a unified platform that breaks down data and process barriers, and delivers a comprehensive set of capabilities covering all key DORA requirements.

https://kpmg.com/xx/en/our-insights/gms-flash-alert/flash-alert-2024-202.html,,,,"The French draft finance bill for 2025 was finally published on Thursday, 10 October.1
The budget was presented against a challenging political and fiscal backdrop, marked by the absence of a clear majority for any party in the National Assembly, and a high public-finance deficit (the deficit is expected to exceed 6 percent of GDP in 2024).
The new government has announced a target of reducing the deficit to 5 percent by 2025, with the ambition of returning, in 2029, to below the ceiling of 3 percent of GDP necessary to meet France's obligations at the European Union level.  Spending cuts, raising revenues from taxes and fees, and other efficiencies factor into the government’s strategy.
This GMS Flash Alert looks at the key personal tax measures for individuals and employers.

WHY THIS MATTERS
The introduction of a minimum tax on higher incomes is one of the key measures announced in the budget to raise the tax revenues of the French state.  It may also raise the costs of an international assignment in respect of assignees in France (and French assignees abroad) covered under French tax law.
Higher earners will need to perform an additional calculation to check if their overall effective tax rate is less than 20 percent and, if so, pay the difference.  Notably, the calculation is not a simple one as it permits the taxpayer to ‘add-back’ numerous tax benefits and credits when calculating the tax he or she has paid.
This is especially important for tax-equalised employees, as existing assignment policies may not be clear on whether the additional tax is equalised or not.  Additionally, employees benefitting from the French impatriate tax regime (Article 155b exoneration) are also at higher risk of having an overall effective tax rate below 20 percent.
The announcement in the budget that employees not resident in France under an applicable treaty are to be
considered not resident for domestic tax purposes is a welcome clarification.  However, it is important that any tax positions reliant on an individual being tax resident under domestic French law are revisited, should there be any interplay with residence under a treaty.

Introduction of a Temporary Minimum Tax on High Incomes
Reflecting the government's desire to involve the wealthiest individuals in reducing the public deficit, a temporary minimum effective tax of 20 percent on ""the highest incomes"" would be introduced to apply to the taxation of income for the year 2024 until the taxation of income for the year 2026.
This tax would apply to individuals tax resident in France whose household income (reference tax income) exceeds €250,000 for single taxpayers and €500,000 for joint taxpayers, when their effective tax rate is less than 20 percent of their adjusted reference tax income.  According to the explanatory memorandum for the measure,2 this contribution would only concern ""a few tens of thousands of tax households.""
The tax taken into account for the calculation of the effective tax rate would correspond to the sum of income tax, the contribution on high incomes, and certain withholding taxes on income tax.  The tax included in the calculation may be increased by €1,500 per dependent and €12,500 for joint taxpayers, as well as the ability to ‘add-back’ for tax advantages provided by various tax reductions and certain tax credits (exhaustively listed in the budget, though notably including foreign tax credits provided for by a treaty).
The additional contribution payable would be equal to the difference between the tax calculated and 20 percent of the adjusted reference taxable income.  In order to mitigate the threshold effect of entry into force, a discount mechanism is intended to be provided.  Further details are expected to follow.
Securing Tax Arrangements Applicable to Non-Residents of France
Recent case law in France3 had stated that, for determining the application of non-resident withholding tax, the analysis turned on the residence status of the employee under French domestic law only.  This focus on the primacy of domestic residence status gave rise to uncertainty around the withholding tax mechanism for individuals resident in France under French domestic law, but resident of another jurisdiction under an applicable treaty.
This decision had overturned the interpretation adopted by the French tax administration, which stated that the residence status of an employee under an applicable tax treaty had primacy over the domestic tax position.
However, following the case, the tax administration had announced by press release4 that it would maintain its interpretation of tax residence despite censure by the Council of State (Conseil d’Etat), with the aim of helping ensure stability in the tax treatment of persons who are not French tax residents.
The budget announced that the primacy of the concept of tax residence in treaty law over that of tax residence in domestic law would now be legally provided for.

KPMG INSIGHTS
This means that individuals not resident in France due to the application of a tax treaty are also to be considered non-resident for domestic tax purposes.  It provides a welcome clarification for tax practitioners, but also for employers operating French withholding tax for non-resident taxpayers.

Other Key Measures

KPMG INSIGHTS
The scope of the minimum effective tax is wider than initially anticipated.  KPMG recommends that costings or projections be undertaken to understand the full impact of the measures, especially for tax-equalised employees.  In particular, employees benefiting from the impatriate tax regime should be considered as they are at higher risk of being under the 20-percent overall effective tax rate on their taxable income.
It is important for companies affected by the measures to pay close attention to the process of the budget as it passes through the legislative process in France, given the absence of a clear majority.  It is expected that significant revisions to the proposed measures may occur given the uncertain political situation.
The first reading of the bill in the National Assembly (lower house of parliament) will take place from 21 October 2024 until 19 November 2024.  The bill will then be discussed in the Senate (upper house of parliament), before a new reading at the National Assembly.  It should be adopted by 21 December 2024, and published in the Official Journal (Journal officiel) before the end of the year.

https://kpmg.com/xx/en/our-insights/operations/q3-24-venture-pulse-report-united-states.html,Operations,Q3’24 Venture Pulse Report – United States,,"VC investment in the US fell in Q3’24, driven in part by an expected seasonal slowdown in VC deals activity. Given the approaching presidential election, some US VC investors have also pulled back from making major investment decisions until the outcome of the election is known and the potential policy directions of the next president are better understood.

Investor interest in AI remains red hot

Despite continued uncertainty in the market, AI continued to see incredibly strong VC investment in the US during Q3’24, led by a $1.5 billion raise by AI-powered defense solutions company Anduril Industries and a $1 billion raise by core AI-focused startup Safe Superintelligence. A wide range of other AI-focused startups also raised $100 million+ funding rounds during the quarter, including Gen AI-focused chip developer Groq ($640 million), immersive technologies company Infinite Reality ($350 million), data infrastructure company Cribl ($319 million), AI-focused surgical solutions company Caresyntax ($310 million), and airline retail platform Flyr ($295 million).

Due diligence continues to be a priority for VC investors in the US

Given the uncertain economic environment and the sustained lack of exit activity, VC investors continued to prioritize deal due diligence during Q3’24, taking a deeper look into areas like pathways to profitability, EBITA targets, growth expectations, and other indicators, prior to making major investment decisions. A number of VC investors also showed an increasing inclination to hold back from making funding decisions in order to see what other VC investors a startup could bring to the table. This has contributed to more collaborative investments as some investors have shied away from taking the lead.

IPO activity remains dry with a few exceptions — like biotech

IPO activity in the US remained quiet in Q3’24, with the exception of biotech — which saw some robust IPO activity late in the quarter, including companies like immunology focused Zenas Biopharma, oncology-focused Bicara Therapeutics, and precision peptide therapy company MBX Biosciences. Outside of the biotech space, IPO activity was very slow — a trend expected to continue through the upcoming presidential election in mid Q4’24. A backlog of companies ready to exit could see IPO activity begin to pick up following the election and into Q1’25, with additional companies preparing for exits later in 2025.

Interest rate cuts could spur M&A activity

During Q3’24, the US Federal Reserve cut its key interest rate by half a point. While this cut has not yet had a chance to have a major impact on VC investment levels or on IPO exit activity as of yet — in part due to the number of investors holding back in advance of the election — it could add fuel to the growing sense of optimism leading into 2025. Over the next quarter, however, the interest rate cut could catalyze M&A activity as buyers reconsider acquisitions that did not make economic sense six months ago in light of the lower cost of capital. Additional rate cuts could spur M&A activity even further.

Trends to watch for in Q4’24

With the upcoming election, VC investment is not expected to change dramatically in Q4’24, although optimism is growing for a potential rebound early in 2025 as uncertainties dissipate and macroeconomic conditions improve.
Given the quiet IPO activity over the past two years, many eyes will be on IPO market in Q4’24 and into 2025 with the hope of a significant reopening of activity. While it might take time for IPOs to materialize, there could be an increase in the number of companies announcing their intent to go public over the next few quarters.
At a sector level, both AI and defense-tech are expected to remain very hot areas for VC investment in Q4’24. Health and biotech will likely also remain very attractive to investors.

""We’re seeing investors taking a much deeper dive into what a company’s path to profitability looks like. They’re not accepting speculation as much as they have in the past; they want to really understand a startup’s projected market, customer base, and growth and profitability expectations. Delving into these factors as part of their due diligence processes is taking longer, which has slowed down deal speeds to some degree.""

https://kpmg.com/xx/en/our-insights/operations/q3-24-venture-pulse-report-americas.html,Operations,Q3’24 Venture Pulse Report - Americas,,"VC investment in the Americas slowed between Q2’24 and Q3’24, driven by somewhat softer investment in the US, including a decline in the number of $1 billion+ megadeals from six to two. While the US continued to account for the vast majority of VC funding in the region, Canada saw a very robust quarter of VC investment — particularly compared to all but the outlier quarters of investment it experienced between Q1’21 and Q1’22. VC investment in Latin America was soft, however, with investment in Brazil sliding quite significantly quarter-over-quarter.

Interest rates drop across much of Americas; Brazil key exception

During Q3’24, the US Federal Reserve cut its interest rate for the first time since 2020, while the Bank of Canada cut its interest rate twice following an initial cut late in Q2’24. Even as other jurisdictions made cuts, however, Brazil’s Central Bank raised its interest rate for the first time in two years in order to rein in inflation.1

Strong quarter of VC investment in Canada

VC investment in Canada was incredibly strong in Q3’24, with investment rising above all but the quarterly totals seen in 2021 and early 2022. The impressive quarter was driven by three $100 million+ megadeals, including a $900 million raise by legaltech Clio, a $500 million raise by Gen AI-focused Cohere, and a $281 million raise by Tenstorrent focused biotech Borealis Biosciences. AI and health and biotech continued to see a lot of interest from VC investors in Canada given their strong innovation ecosystems. Other sectors also attracted sizeable deals this quarter; last mile delivery logistics platform UniUni raised $70 million, while advanced energy solutions company UgoWork raised $51 million and carbon capture technology company Svante raised
$50 million.

Brazil sees challenging quarter amidst major tax reform

VC investment in Brazil was very soft in Q3’24, driven in part by uncertainties related to the significant tax reforms being undertaken in the country — the first major reforms in decades. Stubbornly high inflation, the country’s central bank’s decision to raise interest rates, and the upcoming election in the US likely also contributed to the low volume of VC deals activity during the quarter.
Brazil-based startups have struggled a lot in recent quarters, with many startups closing or conducting large layoffs in the face of pressure to achieve sustainable cash flows. While this has been incredibly difficult for the VC market, the companies that have survived have proven their strength and resilience. This could help them attract fresh rounds of investment and later stage investments heading into 2025. However, in spite of the headwinds, Brazil continued to see some traction in the fintech space, as highlighted by QI Tech’s massive $250 million round this quarter. There is some optimism in Brazil that once the current uncertainties dissipate late in Q4’24 or in Q1’25, that the volume of funding will pick back up.

Cybersecurity regaining attention in Americas

VC investor interest in cybersecurity solutions strengthened in the Americas during Q3’24, with raises by a wide range of companies, including private content network and risk management firm Kiteworks ($456 million) and email security firm Abnormal Security ($250 million). The growing focus of investors on cybersecurity likely reflects both heightening concerns about cyberattacks, including more realistic phishing scams and Gen AI powered attacks, in addition to the increasing complexity of regulatory compliance obligations. The SEC’s cybersecurity incident reporting requirements, for example, now require public companies to report on cyber incidents.2 This has likely sparked interest in cybersecurity solutions, particularly from corporates looking to upscale their cyber protection infrastructure.

Heath and biotech sector continues to attract VC deals

Health and biotech continued to see strong investment in the Americas, particularly in the US and Canada. During Q3’24, US-based surgical care optimization platform Caresyntax raised $310 million, while Canada-based developer of xRNA medicines for kidney diseases Borealis Biosciences raised $150 million. The introduction of AI to biotech solutions has amplified VC investor interest in the space, given its potential ability to speed up development and analytics processes. Health and biotech is also gaining attention from investors in Brazil, although investment levels have been quite small to date compared to other jurisdictions in the region.

Trends to watch for in Q4’24

VC investment in the Americas is expected to remain relatively steady quarter-over-quarter, particularly in the US and Canada. AI will likely continue to see large investments, in addition to areas like health and biotech and cleantech. While cybersecurity investment has taken a backseat to AI in recent quarters, it could also see investment increase over the next few quarters as companies look to stay ahead of potential cyber threats.
In Brazil, there is significant optimism that VC investment will rebound over the next couple of quarters as the government’s tax reforms are completed and macroeconomic factors stabilize.

""We’re seeing a lot of family offices investing in bringing startups into the ecosystem in order to accelerate their transformation. They aren’t generally creating funds themselves, but they are doing alliances with private equity and VC funds to create portfolios that could allow them to transform their businesses""

https://kpmg.com/xx/en/our-insights/operations/q3-24-venture-pulse-report-asia.html,Operations,Q3’24 Venture Pulse Report – Asia,,"VC investment in Asia fell for the fifth consecutive quarter, driven by a slowdown in deals activity and the absence of $1 billion+ megadeals within the region. Philippine-based fintech Mynt’s $788 million raise accounted for the largest deal in Asia during Q3’24, followed by a $688 million raise by China-based Baichuan AI, and large raises by two semiconductor manufacturers – China-based ICLeague ($415 million) and Singapore-based Silicon Box ($363 million). The top 5 deals were rounded out by a $360 million raise by India-based quick e-commerce company Zepto.

VC investment in China remains soft in Q3’24

VC investment in China was relatively quiet in Q3’24, although a number of sectors continued to attract large deals. AI remained a key area of investment, with core AI developers continuing to attract the largest funding rounds, including LLM-focused Baichuan AI ($688 million) and Moonshot AI ($300 million). The advanced semiconductor space also saw a number of $100 million+ funding rounds, including a $415 million raise by ICLeague and a $138 million raise by Semidrive Technology.
VC investors in China also continued to show interest in the health and biotech space; during Q23’24, tumor immunity and microenvironment therapy firm LaNova Medicines raised $44 million, vaccine technology developer Maxvax Heath raised $41 million, microbe-based product developer Moon Biotech raised $41 million, and clinical stage therapeutics company AusperBio raised $37 million.

India bucks global trend with significant raises by consumer-focused businesses

VC investment in India was very solid in Q3’24, driven in part by large VC raises by consumer-focused startups, including quick delivery company Zepto ($360 million), hotel-booking company OYO Rooms ($349 million), and edtech company PhysicsWallah ($210 million). Other big deals included beauty-focused online marketplace Purplle ($120 million), and eyewear retailer Lenskart ($100 million). The large raises by B2C businesses in India was an incredibly unique trend, the opposite of trends seen in most other jurisdictions in Asia and in other regions of the world — where B2B companies attracted the greatest levels of VC investment. Outside of the consumer retail space, two and three wheel electric vehicle and components manufacturer Omega Seiki Mobility also raised $150 million during Q3’24.

Despite economic challenges, Japan continues to attract VC investment

VC investment in Japan was quite strong in Q3’24, despite challenging market conditions, including turbulence in Japan’s stock markets and the possibility of additional interest rate increases. While VC investors continued to hold back from making late stage investments, seed and early-stage funding continued at a good pace during the quarter, likely helped by large scale support from the government.
Generative AI firm Sakana AI attracted Japan’s largest deal of Q3’24 — a $200 million Series A raise,1 followed by cloud HR management firm SmartHR — which raised $135 million, and flying cargo drone and car developer SkyDrive, which raised $95 million. Biotech also attracted a number of raises this quarter, including a $37 million raise by drug discovery company Renalys and a $30 million raise by ThinkCyte.

Trends to watch for in Q4’24

Heading into Q4’24, VC investment in China is expected to remain relatively subdued, with the exception of government priority sectors like AI and semiconductors. In India, however, there is very strong optimism that the VC market is recovering and that the next few quarters could see the level of VC investment really start to climb. Despite some economic challenges, VC investment in Japan is expected to remain steady in Q4’24, with AI, deeptech, and biotech continuing to attract significant attention from VC investors.

While the majority of VC investments being made in Japan are coming from Japanese VCs, these VCs are beginning to attract foreign money and interest. Over time, we expect foreign investment in these VC funds will help increase funding availability here — and also support larger ticket investments similar to what is seen globally. This will likely contribute significantly to the ongoing development of the Japan innovation ecosystem, particularly in areas like deeptech.

Americas attracts largest share of VC funding in Q3’24

Global VC investment during Q3’24 remained relatively subdued, in keeping with recent trends. The Americas accounted for the largest proportion of VC funding globally, driven by a $1.5 billion raise by US-based Anduril Industries, a $1 billion raise by US-based Safe Superintelligence Inc, and a $900 million raise by Canada-based Clio. Asia attracted the second largest share of VC funding among the key regions, driven by a $788 million raise by Mynt, followed by a $688 million raise by Baichuan AI and a $415 million raise by ICLeague — both in China — in addition to a $362 million raise by Singapore-based Silicon Box, and a $360 million raise by India-based Zepto.
Europe also saw a relatively quiet quarter of VC investment in Q3’24, although a number of AI-focused firms raised solid $100 million+ funding rounds. The largest deals this quarter included Germany-based Helsing ($484 million) and France-based gaming company Voodoo ($386 million). Space-tech also received investor attention as highlighted by top deals by Isar Aerospace ($279 million) in Germany and D-Orbit ($166 million) in Italy.

2024 sees strong crop of new early-stage unicorns

At the end of Q3’24, the number of early-stage unicorn companies — companies with valuations over $1 billion — has already exceeded the number seen during all of 2023. This large uptick despite the current uncertain macroeconomic and geopolitical environment has been propelled almost entirely by activity in the AI space, with a number of early-stage AI companies obtaining unicorn valuations on their first major raises. While the number of new unicorns remained well below levels seen during the outlier years of2021 and 2022, it highlights the focus on the AI sector and how VC investors are pouring money into the space even as they take a far more cautious approach to their other investments.

AI continues to draw largest ticket sizes

Globally, AI continued to attract the largest share of VC investment, accounting for the largest deals in the Americas, Asia, and Europe during Q3’24. While core AI companies continued to garner strong levels of investment — including Safe Superintelligence ($1 billion) in the US, ad Baichuan AI ($688 million), Moonshot AI ($300 million) in China and Sakana AI ($200 million) in Japan — industry applications of AI also saw robust interest from VC investors. During the quarter, AI-powered defense-tech companies raised large rounds, including US-based Anduril Industries ($1.5 billion) and Germany-based Helsing ($484 million). China also saw AutoAI, a startup focused on enabling automotive companies to embed AI into their vehicles, raise $107 million in Q3’24.
VC investors globally also showed interest in startups with offerings tangential to the AI space, including companies looking to reduce the energy requirements associated with many AI solutions.

Defense-tech reel in big deals in Q3’24

Defense-tech attracted a number of large raises in Q3’24, including US-based Anduril Industries — a developer of autonomous weapons systems — and Germany-based Helsing — a firm that uses AI to improve weapons capabilities and decision making. Ongoing geopolitical tensions and conflicts have likely driven interest in the defense-tech space. While VC investors have historically shied away from making investments in the sector, growing interest from governments in software and other non-hardware solutions related to defense has led some VC investors to view the space as a good investment opportunity.

Trends to watch for in Q4’24

While VC investment and exit activity will likely remain relatively soft in Q4’24, particularly until after the US presidential election in November, there is a growing sense optimism that exits activity could start to rebound in 2025. M&A activity could be first out the gate as VC investors look at deals in light of interest rate cuts in a number of jurisdictions.
AI is expected to remain a very hot area of investment, although there could be a shakeout as investors increasingly focus on companies able to show how they are using AI to generate real value. Regulation of AI activities will also be a major area to watch over the next several quarters, as governments and regulators increasingly prioritize the need to develop guardrails for AI activities, whether they are focused on safety, privacy, or appropriate use.
While alternative energy solutions have garnered strong interest from VC investors over the last two years — although total investment has fallen off over the last couple of quarters — interest could spike further over the next year given how global energy demand is skyrocketing and predicted to outpace supply.

""I have some cautious optimism that 2025 could be a better year for the global IPO markets. After a very dry couple of years, IPO activity could finally see a resurgence. While we probably won’t see a lot of core AI companies going out yet—in part because many are still working to figure out the optimal business models, and are quite well funded—we could see companies in a wide range of other sectors looking to exit—including health and biotech, fintech, and energy and cleantech.""

https://kpmg.com/xx/en/our-insights/operations/q3-24-venture-pulse-report-europe.html,Operations,Q3’24 Venture Pulse Report – Europe,,"VC investment in Europe was quiet in Q3’24, in part due to a annual slowdown in dealmaking in August as a result of summer holidays. Overall, during the quarter there were ten $150 million+ megadeals in the region, including a $484 million raise by defense-tech Helsing (Germany), a $386 million raise by gaming company Voodoo (France), a $279 million raise by Isar Aerospace (Germany) and a $220 million raise by UK-based fintech Form3. Space-tech also received investor attention as highlighted by top deals by Isar Aerospace ($279 million) in Germany and D-Orbit ($166 million) in Italy.

AI investments increasingly targeting vertical integration

During Q3’24, interest in AI solutions in Europe took a noticeable shift away from away from capital intensive AI platforms and towards solutions focused on vertical integration and the adoption and application of specific AI offerings. In particular, AI-focused defense-tech companies attracted a significant amount of attention from VC investors — as evidenced by the Helsing raise.

Cleantech investment declines as VC investors focus on profitability and value

While cleantech continued to attract VC investment in Europe, investment levels have waned considerably over the last few quarters. Given the uncertain market conditions, it has been more challenging for cleantech startups requiring longer lead times to develop solutions and products to attract funding — particularly later stage funding — as investors have increasingly focused on profitability and the ability of startups to prove their value quickly.

Health and biotech sector attractive to VC investors across Europe

During Q3’24, health and biotech companies across Europe saw renewed interest from VC investors, possibly driven by the increasing application of AI to biotech; the space accounted for a solid number of $100 million+ megadeals during the quarter, including fertility tracker developer Flo Health ($200 million) and oncology treatment company Myricx Bio ($114 million) in the UK, cancer treatment company Catalym in Germany ($150 million), radioisotope producer PanTera in Belgium ($148 million) heart pump developer Magenta Medical in Israel ($105 million), and Alzeimer’s Disease treatment firm Asceneuron in Switzerland ($100 million).

VC investors in UK acting more cautiously with their investments

VC investment in the UK experienced a lull in Q3’24 as VC investors remained risk averse, focusing their investments on later stage companies with proven business models, assets, and growth potential. Health and biotech saw increasing traction during the quarter, evidenced by Flo Heath raising $200 million, Exohood Labs raising $188 million, and Myricx Bio raising $114 million. The fintech sector also saw solid investment and activity during Q3’24, including a $220 million raise by payments platform Form3. During Q3’24, a number of UK-based fintechs announced that they had achieved profitability, including payments network company Zilch1. Revolut also obtained a UK banking license during the quarter.2
While IPO activity remained soft in Q3’24, there was some hope that IPO activity could rebound over the next quarter or two now that the UK general election is over and a sense of stability is returning to the market — particularly compared to other jurisdictions in Europe.

Strong VC investment in Germany including Europe’s largest deal

VC investment in Germany was stronger in Q3’24, including Europe’s largest VC deal of the quarter — a $484 million raise by Helsing, followed by a $278 million raise by Isar Aerospace. Overall VC investment rose from $2 billion in Q2’24 to almost $2.5 billion in Q3’24. While AI continued to see strong investments during the quarter, some core AI focused startups have experienced difficulties — choosing to pivot to other AI value propositions in order to move forward. Despite challenging macroeconomic market conditions, health and biotech continued to see interest from VC investors; during the quarter, oncology focused Catalym raised $150 million.
The continued lack of exits has stifled the German VC market somewhat as VC investors have had to make hard decisions as to which companies to finance given the lack of liquidity. Although one emerging trend in Germany has been the increasing focus on sustainable investments, with a number of VC funds getting into the space. This could be an interesting area to watch heading into Q4’24 and Q1’25.

Quiet quarter of VC investment in the Nordics region

VC investment in the Nordics region was very quiet in Q3’24, falling from $1.2 billion in Q2’24 to only about $860 million this quarter. Despite the slowdown in investment activity, fundraising by VC firms in the region continued at a solid pace—already above 2023’s totals at the end of Q3’24; the higher level of fundraising was driven primarily by the capitalization of a small number of larger funds, in addition to healthy activity among early-stage funds in the region highlighting positive outlook for a longer horizon.
While deal value was soft in Q3’23, a number of sectors continued to garner interest in the Nordics region, including cleantech and AI. Defense-tech and dual-use technologies also increasingly attracted attention. With Finland and Sweden now in NATO, defense-tech and dual-use technologies seem to gain further traction as companies develop potential alliances.

Trends to watch for in Q4’24

VC investment in Europe is expected to remain subdued in Q4’24, although there is some hopefulness that should the exit environment improve, VC investment will bounce back. AI and defense-tech are likely to remain very hot sectors of VC investment, while health and biotech will likely continue to attract a diverse range of investments across the region.
A very hot area of VC investment at present, AI could be a key area to watch over the next few quarters as it could face some regulatory headwinds as regulators increasingly scrutinize how AI solutions are being developed and used, particularly from a data privacy and security perspective.

""Following a strong Q2’24, Venture Capital investment in Ireland saw a significant slowdown in Q3’24, as both traditional and Corporate VCs pulled back. However, the recent announcement by the Government of Ireland of a new Seed and Venture Capital Scheme, set to operate from 2025 to 2029 will inject a $275 million into the ecosystem and offers a promising boost.

Europe sees tepid quarter of VC investment in Q3’24

VC investment in Europe was quiet in Q3’24, in part due to a annual slowdown in dealmaking in August as a result of summer holidays. Overall, during the quarter there were ten $150 million+ megadeals in the region, including a $484 million raise by defense-tech Helsing (Germany), a $386 million raise by gaming company Voodoo (France), a $279 million raise by Isar Aerospace (Germany) and a $220 million raise by UK-based fintech Form3. Space-tech also received investor attention as highlighted by top deals by Isar Aerospace ($279 million) in Germany and D-Orbit ($166 million) in Italy.

VC investment in Asia falls amid ongoing slowdown in China

VC investment in Asia fell for the fifth consecutive quarter, driven by a slowdown in deals activity and the absence of $1 billion+ megadeals within the region. Philippine-based fintech Mynt’s $788 million raise accounted for the largest deal in Asia during Q3’24, followed by a $688 million raise by China-based Baichuan AI, and large raises by two semiconductor manufacturers – China-based ICLeague ($415 million) and Singapore-based Silicon Box ($363 million). The top 5 deals were rounded out by a $360 million raise by India-based quick e-commerce company Zepto.

https://kpmg.com/xx/en/our-insights/gms-flash-alert/flash-alert-2024-201.html,,,,"Sri Lanka’s cabinet spokesman disclosed that the launch of the free visa system has been delayed.1  Furthermore, with effect from 26 September 2024, the ETA (Electronic Travel Authorisation) online visa (Tourist & Business) application system has been reinstated.2
In our earlier report, we notified that Sri Lanka has approved free tourist visas for 35 countries to boost tourism and tourists will be given 30-day visas under a six-month pilot programme that will start from 1 October 2024.  We also mentioned that the online visa system had been suspended.

WHY THIS MATTERS
Many travellers who had planned trips based on the 1 October 2024 launch of the free tourist visa system will now face disruptions. They may need to adjust their travel plans or apply for regular visas.
Sri Lanka has reinstated its ETA (Electronic Travel Authorisation) online visa application system for both tourists and business travellers.  This major update means travellers can apply for either tourist or business visas from the comfort of their homes, eliminating the need for in-person embassy/consulate visits or obtaining on-arrival visas.  This comes as a significant boost for business travellers or tourists planning a trip to the island nation, whether it’s for business meetings, conferences, short training programmes, or exploring Sri Lanka’s beaches, wildlife, and cultural heritage.

Context
Launch of the free visa system for nationals from 35 countries, initially set for 1 October, has been delayed due to the need for parliamentary approval.  As Parliament remains dissolved, it is unclear as to how to implement this scheme prior to the new Parliament meeting, after 14 November.  Therefore, the minister has sought the AG’s (Attorney General) advice on the possibility of implementing this programme with pending parliamentary approval.3
With effect from 26 September 2024, the ETA online visa (Tourist & Business) application system has been
reinstated and travellers can apply for a visit visa online at https://eta.gov.lk/.4
Further Details
The 35 countries included in the mentioned new free visa initiative are:
Australia, Austria, Bahrain, Belarus, Belgium, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Iran, Israel, Italy, Japan, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Nepal, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Oman, the People’s Republic of China, Poland, Qatar, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, UAE, and the United States

KPMG INSIGHTS
The ETA online visa system – now operational again – offers a convenient, fast, and efficient way to enter Sri Lanka whether for leisure or business travel.
Concerned parties affected by the recent and unexpected changes to the free tourist visa system and the ETA should reach out to their usual global-mobility professional or immigration counsel or a member of the global immigration team with KPMG in Sri Lanka (see the Contacts section).
KPMG in Sri Lanka will continue to monitor developments and provide updates as they become available.

https://kpmg.com/xx/en/our-insights/gms-flash-alert/flash-alert-2024-200.html,,,,"Ireland’s Department of Justice has announced the transfer of responsibility for Irish Residence Permit (IRP) renewals.1 
From 4 November 2024, the Garda National Immigration Bureau, responsible for renewal applications for IRPs outside of Dublin, Kildare, Meath, Wicklow, Cork, and Limerick, will transfer its responsibilities to Immigration Service Delivery (ISD). 2

WHY THIS MATTERS
The change to immigration renewals will harmonise renewal applications for non-European Economic Area (EEA) national residents in Ireland regardless of where they live in Ireland and should see a significant reduction in waiting times with some regional offices experiencing seven-month wait times for an appointment.
IRP renewal applicants, immigration advisers, and those employers in charge of the immigration and IRP affairs of their non-EEA employees should take note of this change as it will entail a modification to their usual procedures. 
ISD has announced that non-EEA nationals with an IRP due to expire on 4 November onwards, can renew their IRP online from 14 October 2024, regardless of their location in Ireland.
Currently, only residents of Dublin, Kildare, Meath, Wicklow, Cork, and Limerick are able to renew their IRPs through an online portal.  Residents outside of these areas need to book an appointment at their local Garda Immigration Office for their renewal.  This will change on 4 November 2024.

Details 
IRPs are generally required for non-EEA nationals aged 16 years and above resident in Ireland for more than 90 days.
IRPs can be renewed 12 weeks prior to expiry.
This notice is for those individuals with an IRP expiry on 4 November 2024 onwards.
Renewed IRP cards do not have to be collected in person.  Once the renewal is submitted online, with all of the appropriate supporting documentation, confirmation of the renewal will be issued by email and the new IRP card will be posted to the applicant.  It is essential to provide accurate Irish address details with the Eircode.
First-time IRP applicants are still required to register in person.  If such individuals live outside of Dublin, Kildare, Meath, Wicklow, Cork, or Limerick, they should contact their local Garda Immigration Office for details on how to register.

KPMG INSIGHTS
Minister McEntee has explained the change around transfer of responsibility in these terms: “… allows Gardaí to focus their time on the more operational and enforcement side of their immigration work, such as investigations and deportations.”3 
As a reminder, all IRP holders should make sure they have a valid “in date” IRP when returning to Ireland.  For visa-required nationals who do not have a valid IRP, they may be required to apply for an entry visa.  (For related coverage, see GMS Flash Alert 2024-194

Methodology

The KPMG 2024 CEO Outlook: The private company perspective, part of the 10th edition of the KPMG 2024 CEO Outlook, is compiled from the views of 376 chief executive officers of private companies, which was conducted between 25 July and 29 August 2024, providing unique insight into the mindset, strategies, and planning tactics of CEOs.All respondents have annual revenues over US$500M and a third of the companies surveyed have more than US$10B in annual revenue. The survey included CEOs from 11 key markets (Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Spain, UK and US) and 11 key industry sectors (asset management, automotive, banking, consumer and retail, energy, infrastructure, insurance, life sciences, manufacturing, technology, and telecommunications). NOTE: some figures may not add up to 100 percent due to rounding. In the private company perspective, the largest industries were from infrastructure and transportation, insurance, asset management and telecommunications with 11 percent each. The best-represented countries based on organizational headquarters are the US, the UK, followed by Germany, India, France, Spain and Italy.

https://kpmg.com/xx/en/our-insights/gms-flash-alert/flash-alert-2024-199.html,,,,"The Chilean tax authority (Servicio de Impuestos Internos, hereinafter “Chilean IRS”) published Resolution Ex. N° 86, establishing a new and additional tax obligation to report rental income through Sworn Statement N° 1835 (Formulario 1835, hereinafter “Form N° 1835”).1
The Resolution establishes the scope, instructions, and format of this new filing obligation.  Taxpayers must report to the Chilean IRS the annual rental income earned by means of filing Form N°1835.  This filing obligation will start in tax year 2025 (which refers to the income earned in calendar year 2024).

WHY THIS MATTERS
From a taxpayer’s perspective, the new Form N° 1835 is an additional filing obligation to the Chilean annual tax return, serving an informative purpose for the Chilean IRS.
It will create an additional compliance step for individual traxpayers with such income or for their service providers.
It may be a appropriate for employers with assignees affected by this change to develop and issue a communication explaining what is expected/required.

More Details
Resolution Ex. N° 86 establishes the obligation to report all properties (including those receiving DFL-2 benefits) earning taxpayers rental income regardless of their tax valuation amount and acquisition date if the lease contract is for one or more months within the same calendar year.  If it is referred to as a “leasing contract,” such contracts are excluded from the reporting requirement on Form N° 1835.
Form N° 1835 must be sent to the Chilean IRS, through the Chilean IRS website, by March 25 of each year regarding agricultural and/or non-agricultural real estate rented during the previous year.
Who Will Be Required to File Form N° 1835? 
i.  Property brokers, intermediaries, and agents (mandatarios) of lessors or lessees, who have been involved in the conclusion or administration of a lease contract; and,
ii.  The lessees who, without the involvement of property brokers, intermediaries, or agents, comply with any of the parameters indicated by the Chilean IRS, including Corporate Income Tax taxpayers, professional partnerships, and those entities, whatever their condition, that lease property for the development of one or more activities included in Article 20 of the Chilean Income Tax Law (Ley sobre Impuesto a la Renta).
Penalties for Non-Compliance
Finally, the delay or omission in the filing or its incomplete presentation, will be sanctioned with a penalty of 1 Monthly Tax Unit (UTM) to 1 Annual Tax Unit (UTA).2

KPMG INSIGHTS
Taxpayers with questions concerning the scope of these rules, whether they will be impacted, and what next steps are advisable in order to be in compliance, should consult with their usual tax service professional or a member of the tax/GMS team with KPMG in Chile.

Selection results will be available in May 2025 and winners will be permitted to file their applications for an immigrant visa between October 1, 2025 (i.e., the first day of FY2026) and September 30, 2026.
The Diversity Lottery (DV Lottery) program grants U.S. permanent residence to eligible applicants from certain countries with a low rate of immigration to the United States.  The lottery involves random electronic selection and is conducted by the U.S. Department of State each year. Registration for the lottery must be completed online pursuant to the instructions provided by the U.S. Department of State.2

WHY THIS MATTERS

https://kpmg.com/xx/en/our-insights/regulatory-insights/setting-up-for-success-basel-4-programme-management-approaches.html,Regulatory Insights,Setting up for success: Basel 4 programme management approaches,,"Moving the dial article series
November 2022
The implementation of the Basel 4 capital rules and requirements will be a significant undertaking for banks across the world. It will be much more than a narrow technical exercise — its implications are expected to spread right across the bank, with an impact at the most strategic level. We believe it will lead to fundamental decisions around investments and portfolio management. It’s no exaggeration to say that Basel 4 could be a game changer.
As a result, with little time left before the likely go-live date of 1 January 2025 in regions like the European Union (EU), Basel 4 preparation and project management should be a live topic right now as firms progressively intensify their activity.

A technical challenge

We won’t go into exhaustive detail on all the technical issues and questions created by the final Basel 4 rules, but suffice to say they are far-reaching, including:
Changes to capital calculations across all risk types, whether using standardised approaches or internal models.
A general increase in risk-weighted assets (RWAs) for all risk types — banks authorised to use internal models will be obliged to calculate RWAs in parallel with standardised approaches.
Extensive additional data requirements, e.g. market data granularity and historical data for the use of internal market risk models.
Expected expansion of reporting requirements to the supervisory authorities, e.g. monthly rather than quarterly reporting of market risk.
Impact of a completely new generation of data and reporting software on future IT infrastructure. One bank KPMG professionals are working with, for example, has realised that the changes will touch on no fewer than 50 separate IT systems/applications.

Programme management office approach

Clearly, a comprehensive programme management approach will be integral to delivering such large-scale transformational change. This in itself could necessitate new thinking as, in the quest for leanness and operational efficiency, many financial institutions don’t have a ‘change function’ anymore, with change programmes instead being delivered on a ‘side-of-desk’ basis by staff alongside their business-as-usual (BAU) activities. However, such an approach simply won’t be sufficient to deal with the size and complexity of the task involved in Basel 4 implementation.
Agile approaches and lean methodologies have become the watchwords for many aspects of today’s working, but for large scale regulatory projects of this kind, it is our strong belief that a return to classical, waterfall style project management is needed, with a well-resourced Programme Management Office (PMO) function as the ‘control room’.
In our view, a high-performing PMO can provide the requisite good governance and due diligence to manage the substantial changes of Basel 4 across the entire organisation in functions from capital planning to investor relations. From experience, the PMO function works best if it has a broad knowledge of the functions and people across the organisation. We anticipate this will demand more resources than traditional regulatory change programmes seen in recent years. Many organisations will likely require an uplift in resources to manage the journey.

Programme planning

This journey starts with the programme plan, which sets out the organisation’s Basel 4 goals and strategies to achieve them. A well-constructed plan can help save time and money, enabling early identification of risk and methods to resolve it. The plan can also enable a complex set of activities to be broken down into simple, workable actions. We believe a comprehensive breakdown structure is crucial to enable programme managers to undertake this activity at the earliest stage.
A robust programme management approach sits at the heart of any large-scale transformation. It enables a variety of related projects to be managed in a coordinated manner, allowing for simultaneous execution, shared resources, synchronised activities and engagement across a wide group of stakeholders. Managing related projects or workstreams simultaneously can create opportunities for synergies and optimisation as dependencies and linkages are mapped, helping to promote effective and efficient delivery. This can naturally generate more complexity across the programme and require an agile and resourceful management team. Regular, cross-sectional updates are also an important feature of programme effectiveness.

Basel 4 programme plan

Without doubt, Basel 4 is a more complex undertaking than most other projects, with implementation in a matter of years rather than months. Its implications spread to all parts of the organisation, including areas such as IT. This makes detailed and ordered planning essential. In our view, a thorough impact assessment will be necessary across the enterprise, which will itself result in numerous side projects to help mitigate or optimise those impacts in specific areas and functions. Internal awareness-raising, education and communication become key, with dedicated resources required to keep all stakeholders informed and engaged. Banks should also consider what communication and engagement are necessary with external stakeholders — and when.
Basel 4 is expected to be more demanding for a PMO than other changes. It may be that outside support is needed at the beginning to set-up the programme governance and programme plan.
Outside support from subject matter experts can help add value in the later stages of the multi-year journey, particularly in very specialised areas, such as models, bank steering, and tax and regulatory implications.

Time for action

The clock is ticking. Many banks have already gone a significant way along the journey, but others are further behind. We believe the time for action is now — ensuring banks are optimally set-up in their project management approach is a foundational step for success.

https://kpmg.com/xx/en/our-insights/gms-flash-alert/flash-alert-2024-197.html,,,,"On 23 September 2024, with General Resolution 5572/2024, the Argentinean tax authority’s agreement with the National Immigation office was promulgated.1  The agreement states that whenever an individual requests a tax residency certificate, the tax authority can contact the National Immigration office for information verifying the migration movements of the interested party.
Although before the General Resolution the exchange of information between these government entities was possibile, with the publication in the official journal, the process becomes more automatic.

WHY THIS MATTERS
Taxpayers may need to take greater care in tracking their days inside and outside Argentina since now the tax authorities will have “real time” information at their hands and will be able to establish the presence in the country of each individual.  As it is not yet implemented, it is difficult to say if the terms of the General Resolution, once implelemented, will lead to a speeding up of the process of obtaining residence certificates.  However, it does not entail any changes to employee or employer procedures.  It is a “control” measure for the tax authority that, under current operating procedures, has shown a degree of laxness in terms of compliance.

Details
The General Resolution states that the Dirección Nacional de Migraciones (National Immigration office) can automatically exchange its knowledge of an individual’s presence in Argentina with the Administración Federal de Ingresos Públicos (AFIP, Argentina’s tax authority) as part of its consideration and analysis of a taxpayer’s request for a tax residence certificate (Certificado de Residencia Fiscal). 
Under the agreement between the two government entities, AFIP can systematically consult the databases of the Dirección Nacional de Migraciones to corroborate the movement of individuals who request certificates of tax residence.  Certificates of tax residence are used in the countries with which the Argentine Republic has entered into agreements to avoid international double taxation to prove an individual’s country of residence, which helps determine compliance obligations and which country has taxing rights.
For cases where AFIP can question a dual residence, the fact that they are able to access information regarding the number of days inside a given country can make it easier for them to exercise supervision and control.
The General Resolution spells out the way requests are made, the criteria for consideration of a taxpayer’s request, the timing involved, and the access to and exchange of information processes between the two government entities.

https://kpmg.com/xx/en/our-insights/gms-flash-alert/flash-alert-2024-196.html,,,,"The Ministry of Finance in Taiwan announced amendments to Article 17 of the Income Tax Act,1 shifting the rental expense deduction from the “itemized deduction” category to the “special deduction” category and capped yearly.
This amendment will be effective starting with the 2024 tax year and will affect tax returns filed before May 31, 2025, and onwards.

WHY THIS MATTERS
Before the amendment, rental expenses in Taiwan were deductible as part of itemized deductions, which required taxpayers to exceed a specific threshold to claim the rental expense deduction.  This meant that all taxpayers were able to claim a rental expense deduction as long as such threshold was exceeded.
After this amendment, rental expenses are categorized as special deductions, with a cap of NT$180,000 per year.  This change simplifies the deduction process for low-to-middle income earners, who no longer have to exceed a specific threshold to claim a rental expense deduction.  
However, the amendment introduces strict exclusions, particularly for high-income earners (i.e., those taxed at 20 percent or higher) and homeowners in Taiwan, who are no longer eligible to claim this rental expense deduction, potentially increasing their overall tax liability.
This amendment affects tax residents in Taiwan, including foreign individuals residing or working in Taiwan and are renting homes in Taiwan, especially those whose income tax bracket falls at 20 percent or higher.  This amended rule creates restrictions on claiming the rental expense deduction and may increase the individual’s overall tax liability while working in Taiwan.

More Details
The amendment to Article 17 of Taiwan's Income Tax Act shifting the rental expense deduction from the “itemized deduction” category to the “special deduction” category came into effect starting January 1, 2024.  Under this amended law, the rental expense deduction has increased from NT$120,000 to NT$180,000, but with stricter exclusions for higher-income earners and homeowners in Taiwan.
In Taiwan, special deductions are additional deductions that taxpayers can claim to further reduce their taxable income.  Unlike standard deductions, which apply to all tax residents, or itemized deductions, which require taxpayers to provide documentation of specific expenses in order to claim them, special deductions are aimed at supporting specific groups of people or situations.  These deductions help reduce the taxpayer's overall tax liability by allowing him or her to deduct certain qualifying expenses from his or her gross income.
Special deductions in Taiwan include the following:
Disability deduction: Deduction for tax dependents with disability.
Educational deduction for child’s university or college tuition: Deduction for educational expenses for dependent children.
Long-term care deduction: A special deduction available for taxpayers who incur long-term care expenses for family members.
Now, with the amendment to Article 17 of the Income Tax Act, rental expenses have also been added to the list of special deductions.
Eligibility and Exclusion Criteria
The taxpayer, the taxpayer’s spouse, and his/her tax dependents renting in Taiwan to live (and not for business purposes) may deduct the rental expense from their annual gross income at a maximum cap of NT$180,000 per year.
Further, according to Taiwan’s Income Tax Act, taxpayers cannot claim the special deduction for rental expenses if they meet any of the following criteria:
1.      Homeowners of Taiwan Property: If the taxpayer, his/her spouse, or a tax dependent owns property in Taiwan.
2.      Tax Rate Exceeds 20 Percent: If the taxpayer’s or the spouse’s total taxable income is subject to a tax rate of 20 percent or more (meaning their net taxable income exceeds NT$1,330,001 after deducting the long-term care and rental expense deductions).
3.      Tax Rate of Separately Computed Income Exceeds 20 Percent: If the tax rate of taxpayer’s or the spouse's income, computed separately, is equal to or greater than the tax rate of 20 percent.
4.      Basic Income Over NT$7.5 Million: If the taxpayer’s basic income (which includes foreign-sourced income) exceeds NT$7,500,000 and subject to 20 percent Alternative Minimum Tax (“AMT”).  Note that even if the taxpayers do not claim the mortgage interest expense deduction for owning Taiwan property (which is available under the itemized deduction category), if they are taxed under the AMT, they are still not eligible for the rental expense deduction.
5.      Dividend Income Taxed at 28 Percent: If the taxpayer opts for the separate taxation of dividends at the flat 28-percent rate.

KPMG INSIGHTS
The shift of rental expenses from itemized deductions to special deductions affects both low-to-middle income earners and high-income earners in Taiwan.  High-income earning taxpayers may face higher tax liabilities, because they are largely excluded from claming this special deduction.  On the other hand, low-to-middle income taxpayers can continue to benefit from the NT$180,000 rental expense deduction per year with a more simplified process available under the system.  
High-income individuals and foreign individuals in Taiwan should consult with their qualified tax advisers or a member of the GMS tax team with KPMG in Taiwan (see the Contacts section) to determine if they, their spouses, or tax dependents meet any of the above criteria and whether they are entitled to claim the rental expense deduction.

https://kpmg.com/xx/en/our-insights/gms-flash-alert/flash-alert-2024-195.html,,,,"On 3 October 2024, the Slovak Parliament approved a so-called consolidation package seeking to reduce the public finance deficit.1   According to the government’s projections,2 the approved measures are estimated to save approximately €2.7 billion.
There are several significant changes adopted, including a lower and limited child bonus and a higher base for social security contributions, which could have a negative impact on the net income of employees as well as self-employed individuals and increase costs for companies.
The consolidation package was passed, but not without some vocal disagreements from the government’s opposition as well as the public, in general, due to a shortened legislative procedure and the significant impacts anticipated for businesses and individuals.
If the president of the Slovak Republic signs the legislation, most of the changes introduced will come into force at the beginning of 2025, giving a very short period to adjust to the new rules.

WHY THIS MATTERS
The net income of employees will be mostly affected by a lower or even zero child allowance, and by a higher cap set for social security contributions.  Slovakia-based employers with international assignees employed in Slovakia who are covered under Slovak social security mayl see their burdens and costs increase.
The consolidation package will also bring substantial modifications to VAT rates and, consequently, this could lead to higher consumer prices.  
Moreover, the government has introduced a new tax on financial transactions that will apply to all legal entities as well as individual entrepreneurs, potentially increasing their administrative and fiscal burdens.

Key ChangesLower Child Tax Bonus
The child tax bonus for dependent children (students) over the age of 18 will be cancelled.  Furthermore, there will be a reduction in the maximum child bonus for one dependent child (from €140 to €100 per month).  Moreover, as an individual’s income increases, the child tax bonus will reduce, reaching zero for individuals whose monthly income exceeds €3,632.
Higher Maximum Assessment Base for Social Security Contributions
The maximum monthly assessment base will rise from the current level of seven times the average monthly wage to eleven times the average monthly wage in the Slovak Republic.  This is applicable for both employees’ as well as employers’ contributions, leading to additional contributions to be paid by higher income individuals and by their employers.
Taxation of Self-Employed Individuals
The threshold for the application of a reduced 15-percent personal income tax rate for self-employed individuals will rise to €100,000.
Taxation of Dividends
For corporate dividends earned during periods starting from 1 January 2025, the tax rate for dividends is decreased from the current rate of 10 percent to 7 percent, which was the rate that applied until 2023.  Thus, the 10-percent tax rate is applicable only on dividends from a company’s profits earned for 2024.

KPMG INSIGHTS
This is not a complete list of all the changes, as the package comprises rather complex amendments to various acts.  There are also several other changes which might have an impact on employers or individuals, e.g., changes in the taxation of the company car benefit where the employees drive electric cars, and a decrease in pension benefits for parents with employed or self-employed children, etc.

Other Measures Affecting Various Sectors and Businesses
Rise in corporate income tax rate from 21 percent to 24 percent for corporate taxpayers whose taxable income exceeds €5 million.
Increase in standard VAT rate from 20 percent to 23 percent.  VAT on most food products will drop from 20 percent to 19 percent.
Increase in motor-vehicle tax for personal vehicles owned by entrepreneurs; increase in tolls and highway stamps.
New tax on financial transactions applied to bank transfers (0.4 percent with a maximum of €40 per transaction), cash withdrawals from banks or ATMs (0.8 percent), and the use of company payment cards (annual fee of €2) introduced for companies and self-employed individuals.

KPMG INSIGHTS
Given that the adopted measures are broad and significant, it came as a surprise to many that the package was adopted in so little time, only 16 days after the first proposal was announced.
Taxpayers may have questions about the scope and the impact of the measures, to what degree they will feel the impact, and what steps should be taken in order to be in compliance.  They should direct their questions to their usual tax adviser or a member of the GMS tax team with KPMG in Slovakia (see the Contacts section).

CJEU decides in Dutch anti-abuse case

CJEU – The Netherlands – Anti-abuse provisions – Interest deduction limitation – Arm's length principle – Artificial arrangements – Freedom of establishment

On October 4, 2024, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU or the Court) rendered its decision
opens in a new tab
in case C-585/22. The case concerns the compatibility of the Dutch interest deduction limitation anti-profit shifting rule with EU law. In line with the Advocate General’s opinion, the CJEU held that the rule under dispute is permissible under EU law.
In summary, the Court found that, whilst the Dutch interest limitation rule represents a de facto restriction on the freedom of establishment, this restriction is justified as it aims to combat tax fraud and evasion.
On the question of whether loans contracted at arm’s length could still be considered purely artificial or fictitious arrangements, the Court took the view that the CJEU’s decision in case C-484/19
opens in a new tab
cannot be read as inferring that the mere fact that a loan follows the terms that independent companies would agree upon automatically rules out the existence of a wholly artificial arrangement.

Background

The plaintiff, a Dutch subsidiary (Company X) of a Belgian entity (Company A), acquired shares of an unrelated Dutch entity (Company F), thereby becoming its majority shareholder. The acquisition was financed by a loan granted by another group company (Company C), which was tax resident in Belgium and had received the funds shortly before through a capital injection from Company A. Following the acquisition, the two Dutch companies established a fiscal unity. A dispute arose between Company X and the Dutch tax authorities over the deductibility, for Dutch corporate income tax purposes, of interest expenses related to the intra-group loan.
Under the provisions of the Dutch Tax Code applicable at that time1, the deductibility of interest expenses incurred with respect to loans contracted from related parties – particularly for internal reorganizations or external acquisitions, was restricted (subject to certain conditions). Two exceptions applied:
a rebuttal provision allowed taxpayers to deduct the intra-group interest if they could demonstrate that the debt and the related transactions were primarily business-motivated; or
if the taxpayer could demonstrate that the ‘compensatory tax test’ has been met. Compensatory tax is considered to exist if the creditor is subject to corporate income tax or income tax on the loan interest, with that tax being regarded as fair under Dutch standards. A tax is deemed fair if it results in a tax rate of at least 10 percent on profits calculated in accordance with Dutch standards2.
Under settled case-law in the Netherlands, the interest deductibility restriction applied regardless of whether the interest rate was set at a level which would have been agreed between independent parties on an arm’s length basis.
The dispute reached the Dutch Supreme Court (Supreme Court), which tentatively agreed with the position of the Court of Appeal that the rule under dispute was justified and proportionate in light of the aim of combating tax avoidance and preserving the Dutch tax base. However, the Supreme Court expressed doubts about whether this conclusion was in line with the CJEU’s decision in case C-484/19
opens in a new tab
, concerning the Swedish interest deduction limitation rules. In that judgment, the CJEU held that the exception to the 10 percent rule in the interest deduction limitation rules, applicable between 2013 and 2018, was contrary to the freedom of establishment. In the justification assessment, the CJEU placed particular emphasis on the fact that the exception to the 10 percent rule may cover transactions carried out on market terms and which consequently, in the CJEU’s view, do not constitute wholly artificial or fictitious arrangements. For more details, please refer to E-News Issue 124).
Consequently, the Supreme Court referred the case to the CJEU to clarify whether the rule under dispute was compatible with the freedom of establishment, the freedom to provide services and / or the free movement of capital enshrined in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).
The Advocate General’s opinion
On March 14, 2024, Advocate General (AG) Nicholas Emiliou rendered his opinion in the case at hand. The AG recommended that the CJEU finds the rule under dispute as permissible under EU law.
On the question of whether loans contracted at arm’s length could still be considered purely artificial or fictitious arrangements, the AG noted that his view departs from the CJEU’s ruling in case C-484/19. In the AG’s view, in that particular case, the Court considered that the purpose for which the loan was concluded is not relevant and distinguished between loans contracted on an arm’s length basis (deemed genuine) and those which are not contracted on such basis (which the Court regarded as artificial). The AG warned against the risk that the arm’s length principle becomes a ‘safe harbour’ for taxpayers and consequently recommended that the CJEU revisits its previous case-law on this topic. For more details please refer to EuroTaxFlash 540.

CJEU decision

Applicable fundamental freedom
The CJEU started by analyzing the freedom applicable in the disputed case3. In this context, the Court noted that the Dutch legislation under dispute concerned the tax treatment of interest paid on intra-group debt between companies that may directly or indirectly have a decisive influence on each other’s decisions. Based on these grounds, the CJEU concluded that the Dutch interest deduction limitation rule had to be assessed based on the freedom of establishment - i.e., Article 49 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).
The CJEU recalled that Article 49 TFEU mandates the abolition of restrictions on the freedom of establishment for residents of one Member State within the territory of another Member State. A difference in treatment, leading to a restriction of the freedom of establishment is only permitted if it concerns situations which are not objectively comparable or if the restriction is justified by overriding reasons in the public interest and is proportionate to the aim pursued.
Whether a restriction exists
The CJEU continued by analyzing whether the rule under dispute leads to a difference in treatment that constitutes a restriction on the freedom of establishment. In this regard, the CJEU reiterated that not only direct, but also indirect discrimination, may result in a restriction on the freedom of establishment.
The CJEU acknowledged that the Dutch rules do not entail a direct discrimination based on the residence of the group of companies concerned and went on to analyze whether the rules represent instead a de facto restriction.
In this context, the CJEU assessed whether the criteria in the Dutch interest limitation rules may disproportionately impact cross-border situations. The Court found that the second rebuttal rule (i.e., requiring that interest is subject to fair taxation at the level of the creditor, defined as a minimum tax rate of 10 percent computed according to Dutch standards), could lead to a disadvantageous treatment of cross-border situations. Whilst it is up to the referring court to perform this check, the Court noted that if based on the Dutch tax system, Dutch resident companies receiving interest are taxed at a rate higher than 10 percent, the criterion based on the compensatory tax test can only be failed in cross-border situations – i.e., only Dutch companies that pay interest to affiliated entities established in another Member State may find themselves in a position where the compensatory tax test is not met.
Based on the above, and in line with the opinion of the AG, the CJEU concluded that the Dutch interest limitation rule represents a de facto restriction on the freedom of establishment.
Whether the situations are comparable
In its comparability analysis, the CJEU noted that under Dutch law the ability to deduct interest on intercompany loans when calculating taxable profit is contingent upon ensuring that such interest costs are not artificially generated.
In this context, the CJEU concluded that a company is not in a different situation on the sole ground that the related entity receiving interest is established in another Member State, even if such interest is subject to a rate below 10 percent applied to a tax base computed in accordance with Dutch law. Furthermore, the CJEU reiterated its settled case-law based on which a company established in a Member State that pays interest on an intra-group loan concluded with a related group company established in another Member State is in the same position regarding the payment of that interest as if the recipient were a group company located in the same Member State.
Whether the restriction is justified
The CJEU recalled that restrictions on fundamental freedoms may nevertheless be compliant with EU law when they are justified by an overriding reason in the public interest. In this context, the CJEU noted that the purpose of the rule under dispute was to combat tax fraud and avoidance by preventing the deduction of interest artificially created (i.e., interest on a loan concluded between affiliated entities without any business motives). The fact that the legislation also applies to situations as the one in the case at hand – where entities become affiliated only after an acquisition, does not change the assessment, as the legislation is designed in both situations to combat artificial transactions related to the conversion of equity into debt. Recalling settled case-law under which the fight against tax fraud and avoidance constitutes an overriding reason in the public interest, the CJEU held that the restriction under dispute was justified.
Whether the restriction is appropriate
The CJEU continued by assessing whether the restriction is ‘appropriate’, i.e., whether it is i) suitable to achieving the objective pursued, and ii) genuinely reflecting a concern to attain the objective in a consistent and systematic manner.
The appellant argued that the disputed rule fails to combat artificial intra-group loans in a consistent and systematic manner, as it allows deductions when the interest is taxed at a reasonable rate in the Member State of the lending company, even where the loan and / or the associated transaction lack economic justification.
The CJEU rejected the plea and concluded that the Dutch legislation is suitable to achieve the objective pursued in a consistent and systematic manner. In the Court’s view, the law is designed to neutralize the tax consequences of wholly artificial arrangements created by affiliated entities that do not reflect economic reality and are solely intended to avoid profit tax. This is accomplished by limiting the deduction of artificially generated interest costs and ensuring that such interest is reasonably taxed in the recipient's Member State, thereby preventing the complete avoidance of corporate income tax.
Whether the restriction is necessary
The CJEU further held that the restriction does not go further than necessary to achieve its purpose, on the grounds that: i) it only targets wholly artificial arrangements, and ii) the consequences of a transaction being characterized as such are not excessive.
On the first point, the CJEU recalled its settled case-law based on which the identification of a ‘wholly artificial’ arrangement requires not only an intention to gain a tax advantage but also presence of objective factors indicating that, despite formal compliance with EU law, the objective pursued by the freedom of establishment has not been achieved. The CJEU noted that the Dutch interest limitation rules establish a presumption that interest paid on loans meeting certain criteria (such as being granted by a related party and linked to the acquisition / increase of shareholding in an entity which become related following the acquisition), constitute indications within the meaning of CJEU case-law on the existence of a wholly artificial arrangement.
The Court also noted that this presumption can be rebutted by the taxpayer. This fact limits the denial of interest deductions to cases where the loan was primarily contracted for tax reasons and was not necessary for the achievement of economically justified objectives.
According to the CJEU, whether a loan is concluded on an arm’s length basis or not could represent an objective criterion to determine whether a transaction (partly) constitutes a wholly artificial arrangement. Moreover, the CJEU noted that the assessment of compliance with the arm's length principle encompasses not only the terms of the loan (such as the interest rate) but also the economic validity of the loan and the related legal transactions. This requires evaluating whether the related transaction(s) would have occurred in the absence of the affiliated relationship. In the Court’s view, the lack of economic reality represents a decisive factor in classifying a transaction as a wholly artificial arrangement.
The CJEU also rejected the plaintiff’s plea that the Dutch rules under dispute were not in line with settled case-law, notably case C‑484/19. The plaintiff had argued that Dutch interest limitation rules also targeted legitimate transactions and not only wholly artificial arrangements, insofar as the legislation also applied to interest set in line with the arm’s length principle.
In this context, the CJEU noted that the Dutch interest limitation rule differs from the Swedish legislation under dispute in case C‑484/19, as the purpose of the legislation is not the same. The CJEU also noted that in case C-484/19, the economic validity of the loan and the related transactions were not questioned before the CJEU, and therefore were not assessed by the Court. The CJEU concluded that it can not be inferred from that judgment that the mere fact that loans are concluded on an arm’s length basis, implies that the loan and the legal transactions can not, by definition, constitute a wholly artificial arrangement.
On the second point above, with respect to the consequences of deeming the loan artificial, the CJEU distinguished between two situations:
the artificial nature of a transaction results from an artificially high interest rate on a loan that, in itself, reflects economic reality. In this case, the Court deemed it proportionate to deny the deduction of any interest that exceeds the arm’s length interest rate;
 the loan itself is not based on any genuine business considerations and would not have been concluded without the affiliation between the entities and the tax advantage sough. In this scenario, the Court found it consistent with the principle of proportionality to limit the entire interest deduction.
The Court also noted that the rule under dispute does not breach the principle of legal certainty. In this context, the CJEU upheld the AG’s comments and acknowledged that legislation aimed at preventing abusive tax practices must rely on abstract concepts to cover a wide range of tax fraud and avoidance scenarios. Furthermore, the Court took the view that the use of such abstract concepts does not mean that the application of the law is left to the arbitrary discretion of tax authorities, rendering it unpredictable. As such, the Court recalled its previous finding that the Dutch legislation includes clear criteria, thus allowing taxpayers to anticipate its application with sufficient precision.
In light of the above, the CEU concluded that the freedom of establishment should be interpreted as such that it does not preclude national legislation to limit the full interest deduction on a loan that is considered (part of) a wholly artificial arrangement, even where the interest rate stipulated therein does not exceed the interest that would have been agreed upon between independent companies.

ETC Comment

The CJEU did not explicitly revisit its judgement from case C-484/19, as was earlier advised by the AG. Instead, the CJEU held that it cannot be inferred from its ruling in that particular case that compliance with the arm’s length principle was sufficient to deem a loan and the related transaction as non-artificial, by which the CJEU provided a nuanced interpretation of case C-484/19.
It is now clear that the deduction of interest can be denied in full, if a loan would never have entered into existence in an at arm’s length situation, notwithstanding the arm’s length interest rate.
In light of the concept of wholly artificial arrangement, the CJEU reiterated their abuse of law principles from settled case-law, among which:
 A restriction of the freedom of establishment can only be justified by combatting tax fraud and tax evasion, if such restriction prevents the conduct consisting in creating purely artificial arrangements, devoid of economic reality, with the aim of evading the tax normally due on profits generated by activities carried out on national territory.
The principle of the prohibition of abusive tax practices also applies, when the pursuit of a tax advantage constitutes the essential aim of the transactions concerned.
The fact that a taxpayer pursues the tax regime most advantageous to him, cannot, as such, give rise to a general presumption of fraud or abuse, however a taxpayer cannot benefit from a right or advantage arising from EU law where the transaction concerned is purely artificial in economic terms and is intended to evade the influence of the legislation of the Member State concerned.

https://kpmg.com/xx/en/our-insights/esg/kpmg-recognized-as-a-global-market-leader-in-climate-change-consulting.html,ESG,KPMG recognized as a global market leader in Climate Change Consulting,,"We are excited to share that KPMG has been named a global market leader by Verdantix in their Green Quadrant: Climate Change Consulting 2023.
The report states: “KPMG stands out for its climate risk strategy and emissions data assurance capabilities.”
We are proud of the commitment KPMG has demonstrated in building a leading climate change and decarbonization practice focused on understanding climate and nature risks and opportunities to accelerate organizational change.
The report notes “KPMG offers a strategy-led approach to climate risk, with expertise in readiness reviews and board engagement capabilities for climate action. Through the use of its proprietary ClimateIQ multi-industry risk management tool to help firms assess both physical and transitional climate risks, KPMG helps firms understand and project the impact of climate change on their business.”
KPMG firms’ decarbonization, climate and nature teams form an extensive global organization helping clients navigate this increasingly important landscape by providing a broad range of climate consulting services in areas such as climate risk, decarbonization strategies, energy transition, policy and regulation, and also helping clients finance the cost of implementing climate and decarbonization strategies.

According to the report, “KPMG leads in this Green Quadrant for climate risk, opportunity and adaptation disclosures. KPMG consultants have strong regulatory expertise at the entity, portfolio and product level, with experience across both voluntary and mandatory frameworks, as demonstrated by the firm's lead role on the Initiative Climat International (iCI) working group for Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) implementation recommendations under the UN Principles for Responsible Investment (UN PRI).
Providing the benefits of a multi-discipline approach, KPMG professionals apply industry-leading experience, data-driven technology, and global alliances to help clients develop robust sustainability plans which deal with both the risk and opportunity aspects of climate.

Verdantix states in its report, “KPMG emerged as the top provider of emissions data assurance services in this Green Quadrant, with a score of 2.7/3.0.”
Verdantix concludes that “With the emergence of global climate change disclosure regulations - notably the EU's Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) and the anticipated - but delayed - climate change disclosure rule from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) - firms are under increased pressure to ensure that emissions disclosures are both accurate and assured. KPMG's capabilities in disclosure and assurance-related services make it a strong shortlisting candidate for businesses that are at the readiness stage for complying with regulations. Furthermore, KPMG's global footprint will be a benefit to firms with cross-jurisdictional operations and complex disclosure requirements.”

Companies went from only having to disclose ‘potentially sustainable’ (taxonomy-eligible) activities in reports published in 2022, to now having to assess taxonomy-alignment for the first two environmental objectives as well as eligibility for four more objectives defined by the EU Taxonomy. This not only changed the general amount of effort required for the analysis, but also led to more companies and their business models being covered, potentially bringing clarity into the sustainability efforts of a lot more industries. 
This year’s study provides valuable insights in the EU Taxonomy disclosures of 291 European large public-interest entities. We analyzed which numbers of eligibility and alignment were reported on average in different sectors and whether those, as well as the accompanying qualitative disclosures, have improved compared to the previous year. We also analyzed how overall eligibility has changed with new activities for the four remaining environmental objectives being introduced.

WHY THIS MATTERS 
The ISD Office in Dublin has published a notice advising non-European Economic Area (non-EEA) nationals with an IRP that is due to expire and who intend to travel over the Christmas holiday period, to submit an online renewal application for their IRP by 31 October 2024.
Due to high processing times, affected non-European Economic Area (EEA) nationals who do not renew their IRP prior to 31 October 2024, may not receive their renewed IRP in time for Christmas.
Non-EEA nationals should be aware that they must have a valid IRP when travelling back into Ireland, and for visa-required non-EEA nationals, their IRP acts as their re-entry visa.

Details 
Generally IRPs can be renewed 12 weeks prior to expiry and this notice is for those individuals with an upcoming renewal before or during any intended international travel over the Christmas holiday period.
Residents of the following locations can renew their IRP online:  Dublin, Kildare, Meath, Wicklow, Cork, and Limerick.
Currently ISD is experiencing a high volume of IRP renewal applications, taking three to four weeks to process with a possible further two weeks for new IRP cards to issue by post, resulting in an overall lead-in time of six weeks. 
Non-EEA nationals should renew their IRP cards as soon as possible, and no later than 31 October 2024, so that they will receive their renewed IRPs ahead of the Christmas holiday period.  Applications should be made online via the ISD online portal.

KPMG INSIGHTS
All IRP holders should make sure they have a valid ‘in date’ IRP when returning into Ireland.  For visa-required nationals in the event they do not have a valid IRP they may be required to apply for an entry visa.
If employers have questions regarding the process and appropriate next steps, they should contact their usual immigration counsel or a member of the Immigration and Employment Law team with KPMG Law in Ireland (see the Contacts section).

https://kpmg.com/xx/en/our-insights/ai-and-technology/the-right-data-strategy-can-help-your-ai-plan-succeed.html,AI and Technology,The right data strategy can help your AI plan succeed,,"Before exploring its role in powering the effective use of gen AI tools, it is critical to understand what a “data strategy” entails in a corporate legal setting. In general, a data strategy is a comprehensive plan that outlines how an organization collects, stores, manages, shares, and uses data.

Introduction

Generative AI (gen AI) has ushered in a wave of significant transformations across a range of business functions, including corporate legal functions. This innovative technology has the potential to transform legal departments and enhance efficiency across a spectrum of tasks, such as analyzing data, researching legal issues, summarizing documents, and comparing information. Legal organizations are attempting to embrace these new tools. However, they frequently fail to consider a key component needed for success: a robust data strategy.

What is a ‘data strategy’?

Before exploring its role in powering the effective use of gen AI tools, it is critical to understand what a “data strategy” entails in a corporate legal setting. In general, a data strategy is a comprehensive plan that outlines how an organization collects, stores, manages, shares, and uses data. It is a roadmap that aligns the organization’s data initiatives with its strategic business goals. A robust data strategy addresses issues including data governance, data quality, data architecture, and data literacy, helping to ensure that enterprise data are treated as assets that can drive decision-making and innovation. Finally, a foundational component of a data strategy is a blueprint that provides tactical insights into the systems where data resides, the interconnectivity of those systems, and the data stored there, as well as the business questions/considerations that each system (and its associated data) is intended to address. In the context of a corporate legal function, this will typically influence how department resources are capturing and storing information related to legal matters, contracting, and law department knowledge.

The role of a defined data strategy in the successful implementation of Gen AI

Generative AI, a subset of artificial intelligence (AI), uses machine learning models to create, review, and analyze content including text, images, and even software code based on user input and the data it can access. As an example, in the context of corporate legal functions, gen AI can be leveraged or trained to support the following use cases:
Review contract templates to help identify deviations in third-party paper and generate responsive positions that the legal team has pre-approved.
Organize and manage the vast amount of knowledge within a legal department. It can help in categorizing, searching, and retrieving information quickly and efficiently.
Analyze historical case history to generate strategic insights, aiding in the creation of tailored legal content to enhance a company’s negotiations and litigation strategy and results.
Streamline the process of reviewing legal invoices. It can analyze line items, compare them against agreed-upon rates and rules, identify billing errors or discrepancies, and help ensure compliance with the company’s billing guidelines.
However, the quality and accuracy of the output heavily relies on the quality and depth of the underlying data available to the AI tool.
Without a well-defined data strategy, in-house legal teams may face numerous challenges in implementing gen AI, which can limit the effectiveness of the tool. These include:
Inaccurate outputs: If the data used to train the gen AI models are not accurate or comprehensive, the large language models underlying gen AI may generate faulty, incomplete, or misleading outputs. Unless caught and corrected, such outputs may lead to suboptimal decisions and increased risk for the organization. In addition to significant reputational and  other implications for the legal department and individual attorneys, low-quality gen AI outputs can also create other major risks—from financial, regulatory, litigation, public relations, and other perspectives—for the business as a whole.
Inefficient or slow models: Without a well-organized data architecture, it may be difficult for gen AI models to access and use data effectively. This could lead to inefficiencies in the use of gen AI and a decrease in the overall productivity of the legal function.
Compliance Issues: If the data used to train the gen AI models are not compliant with relevant data protection regulations (including but not limited to HIPPA, GDPR COPPA), the organization could face legal and reputational risks. Similarly, using improperly obtained and unlicensed data to train large language models (LLMs) can create serious intellectual property implications.

Building a robust data strategy

A robust data strategy can serve as the foundation for successful Gen AI integration. This strategy, tailored to harmonize with the company’s overarching business objectives and goals of the enterprise and its corporate legal function, helps serves as the North Star guiding all initiatives. At its core, the development of a data strategy for Gen AI implementation, typically a collaborative effort between legal operations and technology resources, should empower corporate legal departments to evolve into more effective business partners. Developing a data strategy usually involves these key steps:

Conclusion

A mature data strategy is a fundamental prerequisite for the successful integration of gen AI into corporate legal functions. Crafting a robust data strategy can help ensure that gen AI models have access to high-quality, relevant data, enabling them to generate reliable and useful outputs. This can not only help improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the corporate legal function, but also drive strategic decision-making and foster innovation. Investing in gen AI technologies and regularly updating the data strategy are key steps in this process. Ultimately, the integration of a mature data strategy and gen AI into corporate legal functions can significantly contribute to an organization’s overall success by leveraging technology to help stay ahead of the curve.
The journey toward integrating gen AI into your corporate legal functions is a strategic investment towards your organization’s overall success.

https://kpmg.com/xx/en/our-insights/ai-and-technology/investing-in-cybersecurity-to-safeguard-innovation.html,AI and Technology,Investing in cybersecurity to safeguard innovation,,"Technology was once the backbone of a business, providing a central  support structure to the organization. Data, too, played a supportive role to manage customers, inform decisions and improve efficiencies. This is no longer true. Today, technology and data are at the heart of a business – pumping vital capabilities and insights to create value in most, if not all, parts of the organization.
Just as the role of technology has evolved, so too, should cybersecurity. Amid economic pressures, many business leaders are turning to generative AI, digitization and connectivity to help their organizations be more resilient, agile and innovative. KPMG’s latest CEO Outlook reports that 72 percent of global CEOs are concerned about their long-term prosperity.1 This future focus has many business leaders embracing the promise of AI and other advanced technologies to put their business on the trajectory for long-term, sustainable growth. As such, a majority of global CEOs (64%) indicate they would invest in AI regardless of economic conditions.2
As organizations increasingly rely on digital infrastructures, cybersecurity can no longer be a supportive function. Instead it should become a strategic cornerstone to help protect an organization’s operational continuity, value creation and future prosperity, while helping to unlock the true potential of AI.
Many CEOs recognize the challenges ahead. Unlike generations past, today’s CEOs are no longer removed from technology. They use it every day in and out of the office. Many have had first-hand experience with cyber incidents – whether it’s a personal email being hacked or a regulatory fine for mishandling data. And, if they haven’t, they have likely been exposed to headlines about cyberattacks, data breaches and privacy violations. This growing appreciation for cybersecurity has 73 percent of Global Tech Report respondents saying they are investing more in cybersecurity to protect their operations and intellectual property from AI threats.3
Balancing investments
The growing momentum around AI has almost all respondents to the CEO Outlook planning to invest in AI in some form.4 The more technology – especially self-learning technology that comes into the business – the more at risk it is to cyber threats. The business impact of such risks also rises: 76 percent of global CEOs agree that cybercrime and insecurity will negatively impact their organization’s prosperity over the next three years.
This knowing creates new challenges for CEOs: how to balance investments in technology with the need to secure their digital infrastructure. At first glance, technology can appear to be accessible and inexpensive. But securing it to the level necessary to protect an organization and its users often requires a more nuanced approach.
Advanced technologies like generative AI are bringing new capabilities into an organization, which can require more specific parameters that go beyond traditional security features. It’s not enough to only secure the new technology additions. Instead, as new technology integrates with legacy systems, new security features should be incorporated to enable a more unified security strategy across all technologies – old and new.
As the layers of security are applied, this can affect budgets. The key to finding the right balance lies in allocating investments to allow for new innovations to be introduced while prioritizing security. In some cases, a smarter, more cost-effective approach may be to replace old security technology with more modern systems with AI capabilities; instead of maintaining legacy systems. The CISO can help organizations strike the right balance.
Evolving the CISO’s role
In the past, the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) had few choices to protect their organization: a firewall, an antivirus system, and an internal detection system to name a few. Those days are long gone. Advancing AI tools are introducing new levels and types of risks CISOs should protect their organization against. Add to this a growing cybersecurity industry that is innovating a plethora of tools and systems to solve even the most niche risks.
This isn’t the only change for CISOs. Not only should they protect their organization from known threats, but they also help ensure the company can innovate without compromising security. It can be a tough balance to strike. Here are some ways CISOs can evolve their role to support their business:
Act as a risk manager: Not every cyber risk needs to be solved, but some are critical. As such, CISOs should evaluate the risks that pose the greatest threat to the business, quantifying the value they’re protecting so they are focusing on safeguarding what really matters.
Become an investment manager: More than managing risk, CISOs should also manage the company’s investment in cybersecurity. This means deciding where to allocate resources effectively, focusing on the options that solve the biggest problems.
Showcase value: Proving the ROI of cybersecurity can be tricky especially when success means nothing happens. As such, CISOs should find creative ways to demonstrate value, like showcasing how security investments prevented regulatory penalties or operational downtime.
Use AI for efficiency: As with other use cases, AI can help automate the manual work involved in security management, such as detecting anomalies, summarizing data, and even creating self-healing systems.
Cultivating a cyber focus
As organizations race ahead with AI, many progressive CEOs and CISOs are integrating security and privacy considerations from the start. A majority of organizations (72%) are embracing secure-by-design by empowering cyber teams in the early stages of tech investments.5 By doing this, security is no longer an afterthought – and the business can move forward without unexpected interruptions. In other words, cybersecurity can help drive transformation and innovation.
Adopting such a proactive approach requires more than joining the project early. It demands a cultural shift within an organization. Almost three-quarters (74%) of global CEOs agree that building a strong cyber culture is central to integrating AI safely into their organization.6 For these organizations, cybersecurity is no longer an IT issue. It’s part of a company’s DNA where everyone – from developers to the C-suite – understand that security is as critical as innovation.

https://kpmg.com/xx/en/our-insights/transformation/digital-money-is-moving-fast.html,Transformation,Digital money is moving fast,,"In a digital age where technology influences every aspect of our lives, Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) have emerged as a significant focus for governments, financial institutions, and businesses. These digital versions of national currencies promise enhanced security, efficiency, and increased financial inclusion. However, they also raise questions regarding architecture, technology, and governance. Download the PDF for an in-depth exploration of the various CBDC models and their implications for central and commercial banks, as well as citizens and customers.

What is a CBDC?
A CBDC is a government-issued digital version of a country's fiat currency, regulated by a central authority, and managed by a central bank. Unlike decentralized cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, CBDCs are centralized, state-owned, and recognized as legal tender.
Impact on businesses and commercial banks
CBDCs can simplify payments and reduce transaction costs but may also introduce complexities and risks. Commercial banks face competition and opportunities for value-added services, while potentially seeing changes in their traditional roles.
CBDC models
Central banks globally are at various evolutionary stages with CBDCs, so there are currently many models and approaches. Governments and financial institutions are conducting real-world tests to explore the desirability, feasibility and viability of each type.
These digital currencies promise to reshape domestic and international financial systems, but their success hinges not just on individual attributes. They must also be able to interact seamlessly with other CBDC systems. Interoperability, as highlighted in a 2023 World Economic Forum paper[i], is critical to ensure that CBDCs can fulfil their potential in a globalized economy.
Main CBDC models follow the four following archetypes:
Wholesale CBDC for domestic use
Focusing first on Wholesale CBDCs aimed at domestic financial institutions, these have significant potential to revolutionize domestic payment systems and interbank settlements. While they are feasible and advantageous for these specific sectors, it's worth noting that their scope and impact are confined to a specialized market within the financial industry.
Retail CBDC for domestic use
Turning to Retail CBDCs, which are intended for the general public, these offer notable benefits from a consumer standpoint. However, their introduction poses considerable challenges in terms of feasibility. Specifically, there are concerns about how these might disrupt existing commercial banking systems and potentially destabilize financial markets.
Retail CBDC for cross-border use
Using Retail CBDCs for cross-border transactions offers advantages, but these are largely theoretical at this stage. While they could offer benefits to individual consumers engaging in international trade, several obstacles stand in the way, such as foreign exchange management, consumer protection and regulatory compliance.
Wholesale CBDC for cross-border use
Finally, of the various options, Wholesale Cross-Border CBDCs are emerging as the most balanced in terms of desirability, viability and feasibility. These digital currencies hold promise for significantly streamlining international trade by eliminating inefficiencies in traditional banking systems, allowing multiple currencies and assets to be settled and various access policies to coexist.
As central banks worldwide explore various CBDC models, Wholesale Cross-Border CBDCs have emerged as a top priority for many, due to their desirability, viability and feasibility. This shift marks a transition from years of theoretical study to the actual process of productization. Before diving into the critical questions central banks must consider, let's first outline the broader opportunities and risks of adopting CBDCs.
Opportunities and risks of CBDCs
CBDCs offer efficient payments, cost savings for central banks, and financial inclusion. However, they require acceptance, address regulatory challenges, and demand robust security measures.
Five crucial questions for central banks
1. What is our adoption strategy?
Central banks need to carefully consider their adoption strategy for CBDCs as compared to traditional money. This involves examining the current payment landscape and planning how it will accommodate CBDCs. Setting realistic goals based on detailed business cases can help guide design and policy decisions.
2. What is our role and who do we serve?
It’s essential to clarify the level of central bank involvement and the roles that commercial banks and other financial institutions will play in the CBDC ecosystem. Assumptions shouldn’t be made that all businesses will automatically act as distributors. The CBDC’s design should also meet the specific needs of various users, whether they’re private citizens, commercial banks or corporations.
3. What happens if there’s a run on CBDCs?
Because CBDCs can be remunerated, they offer advantages but also pose risks, such as potential runs on commercial bank deposits during a crisis. Design features like individual holding limits and tiered remuneration need to be considered to maintain financial stability.
4. How good is our cybersecurity?
The security and resilience of the CBDC infrastructure is paramount to prevent potential cyberattacks and technical glitches, which could disrupt national and international financial systems. Robust security measures and protocols are crucial for mitigating these risks.

5. What are our resource and capability requirements?
Managing CBDCs will likely demand significant resources and capabilities, even from well-governed central banks. New decision-making processes, change management practices, and partnerships will likely be needed for effective CBDC implementation.
Five business-critical questions for commercial banks
1. How will we ensure interoperability?
Commercial banks can be partially responsible for the technical infrastructure that supports CBDCs, so it's crucial that their systems are designed to be interoperable with digital currencies. This can facilitate the seamless movement of funds within the evolving payment landscape.
2. What infrastructure investment do we need?
Implementing CBDCs may require significant changes to core operations, affecting retail banks, payment service providers and merchants alike. While modernizing their payment processes, these organizations should also continue to maintain their existing operations.
3. How could our liquidity and capital requirements be impacted?
Maintaining adequate liquidity and capital buffers is essential when implementing CBDCs. Advance planning is needed to help ensure that continuous risk assessment is in place, along with the ability to anticipate any policy changes.
4. Is anti-money laundering (AML) compliance assured?
CBDCs need to be integrated into banks' existing AML frameworks. This will likely require adapting or developing new AML controls and monitoring processes to stay compliant with regulations.
5. Is disruption likely?
The introduction of a retail CBDC could see central banks becoming competitors in the payments industry. This has the potential to destabilize funding bases for commercial banks. Furthermore, the introduction of new risk-free assets could disrupt capital markets. Careful design choices are especially important for retail CBDCs to mitigate these risks.
Supporting CBDC development
CBDCs are reshaping the financial landscape, offering opportunities and challenges for central and commercial banks. Careful planning, analysis, and professional guidance are important to navigate this evolving digital currency landscape.

The consumer goods and retail (C&R) industry, with its substantial reliance on primary raw materials and its significant environmental footprint, has a crucial role to play in this transition.

In this report, we examine the progress of the C&R sector towards circularity. By analyzing six key areas, the report provides a snapshot of the industry's readiness across its different sub-sectors, highlights leading practices, and offers recommendations for accelerating the shift to a circular economy.

From talk to action

Paving the way for a circular economy in the consumer goods and retail industry

Circularity brings significant opportunities for C&R to reimagine the future.

Embracing circularity is not just an environmental imperative for C&R businesses — it's a strategic opportunity to unlock new value and build resilience. From the more efficient use of resources, more resilient supply chains, lower operational costs, through to innovative new business models, synergies and collaborations, we believe it’s an opportunity too costly to ignore.

Key recommendations for accelerating circularity

Our research reveals that while many C&R companies have circular ambitions, translating those ambitions into action requires a focused approach. Here are some key recommendations by sub-sector:

Key findings from the research

What can investment leaders learn from the Asset Management CEO Outlook?

Methodology

The KPMG 2024 Asset Management CEO Outlook, part of the 10th edition of the KPMG 2024 CEO Outlook, is compiled from the views of 125 asset management chief executive officers, which was conducted between 25 July and 29 August 2024, providing unique insight into the mindset, strategies, and planning tactics of CEOs. All respondents have annual revenues over US$500M and a third of the total companies surveyed have more than US$10B in annual revenue. The survey included CEOs from 11 key markets (Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Spain, UK and US) and 11 key industry sectors, including asset management. NOTE: some figures may not add up to 100 percent due to rounding. In the asset management research, the two largest sub-sectors were private equity (or special situations, private credit, infrastructure or similar direct investment strategies) with 22 percent of respondents and traditional asset management (primarily equities and fixed income) with 18 percent. The best-represented countries based on organizational headquarters are the US, the UK, followed by Australia, Canada, China, France, India and Japan.

https://kpmg.com/xx/en/our-insights/regulatory-insights/eu-banking-package-2021-meet-the-challenges-head-on.html,Regulatory Insights,EU Banking Package 2021 – meet the challenges head-on,,"After a year’s delay, October 2021 saw the European Commission publish its proposal for the final implementation of Basel III — also known as Basel IV. The Banking Package 2021 makes Europe the first major jurisdictions to set out a vision and timetable for implementing the Basel Committee’s latest global reforms1.
The package seeks to enhance financial stability, while also facilitating the flow of finance to the economy as Europe recovers from the pandemic and transitions to carbon neutrality. Its main components are revisions to the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR III), the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD VI) and the “daisy chain” proposal (to amend CRR in the area of resolution). The proposed application date is January 2025.

Expected high-level impacts

The EU package adopts the bulk of the Basel Committee’s proposals but makes some specific changes. These have been largely welcomed by the European banking industry. In particular, the package proposes a lengthy transition period, with reduced risk weights under the standardised approach for residential mortgages and loans to unrated corporates. These will significantly reduce the potential increase in many banks’ risk-weighted assets by limiting the impact of the output floor (OF) — a minimum capital requirement for banks using internal models. The OF is set at 72.5% of the own funds requirement that would apply under the standardised approach.
The Commission estimates that the full implementation of its proposals would lead to a weighted average increase in minimum capital requirements of between 6.4% and 8.4% by 2030. According to the EBA, 10 of the 99 banks covered by its impact study (which collectively represent 75% of EU banking assets) would need to raise a total of less than €27bn to meet the package’s capital requirements.2 This equates to approximately 2% of the €1,414bn of total regulatory capital held by the 99 sampled banks at the end of 2019.

More time to adjust

The EC proposes CRR III and CRD VI to be applied from January 2025. Several phasing-in periods are planned, with full implementation anticipated by 2032:
Application of the OF will be phased in from 2025 until 2030, meaning that internal ratings-based (IRB) banks will not need to hold the full 72.5% of the own funds requirement under the standardised approach until the end of that period.
Unrated corporates with a probability of default below or equal to 0.5% will receive a reduced risk weight of 65% in the standardized approach at least until 2032, compared to 100% in the Basel Committee’s proposals (if not “investment grade” or SME).
A transitional pattern has also been included for real estate mortgages. Low risk exposures secured by mortgages on residential property can apply a favourable risk weight until 2032 or 2029, depending on certain defined conditions.

Going beyond Basel

In some areas, the package goes beyond the final implementation of Basel III. It proposes a number of enhancements to existing EU banking rules, including:
ESG requirements. The package expects banks to identify, disclose and manage environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks at an individual level. Management bodies are also required to factor these risks into banks’ strategies and develop plans to address them. In line with the objectives set out in the Strategy for Financing the Transition to a Sustainable Economy, the proposals give supervisors the power to address ESG risks through the prudential framework, such as the Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP) or climate stress testing.
Fit and proper assessments. The package proposes a more harmonized approach to fit-and-proper frameworks in the EU. It sets out minimum requirements for key function holders and proposes a common assessment framework to verify compliance by board members.
Third Country Branches (TCBs). The package defines a new common framework for TCBs requiring all branches from non-EU countries to go through a new authorisation process. National competent authorities are empowered to evaluate the systemic importance of TCBs, which could lead to requirements for subsidiarisation or restructuring, or the imposition of Pillar 2 requirements.

What does this mean for banks?

The proposals set out in the package need to be discussed in the European Parliament and could still undergo changes. Even so, banks should start preparing for the new regulatory framework now. As a first step, institutions can consider the six following actions:
Conducting an impact assessment regarding the effects on capital planning.
Understanding areas of vulnerability and exposure to any idiosyncratic impacts.
Optimising risk-weighted assets (RWA) calculations, starting with the standardised approach for credit risk.
Performing a gap analysis (or updating previous Basel III analyses), including key changes to IT infrastructure and data.
Using the results of this analysis to adjust risk appetites, credit risk frameworks or business model decisions — including product design — to mitigate the effects of the package.
Stepping-up “ESG culture” and ensuring that exposure to ESG risks can be identified, managed and disclosed.

Looking ahead

The EU’s banking package raises many challenges for European banks. Although institutions have been granted more time to adjust, the new rules remain a concern for many, especially considering how their impact varies across countries and business models.
However, some developments have already been observed. For example, some lenders have already started to adjust their pricing to reflect the new regulations, such as charging more to unrated corporate borrowers. These actions are generating pressure to expand the availability of rating scores for corporates.
In short, banks should do their homework on the banking package, helping to ensure they can meet changing supervisory and regulatory expectations right up until the implementation date.

https://kpmg.com/xx/en/our-insights/gms-flash-alert/flash-alert-2024-193.html,,,,"On 1 October 2024, the Irish government announced a number of measures that will apply for 2025, some of which seek to address the cost-of-living challenges in Ireland1.  In addition, some retrospective income tax credits may be available in 2024 for some taxpayers.  These measures, along with other previously-announced matters, will be formalised as part of the Finance Bill to be published next week.
In this GMS Flash Alert, we describe key measures announced on Budget Day potentially impacting individuals – including internationally-mobile employees and their employers.

WHY THIS MATTERS
A rise in the standard-rate income-tax band, increases in various tax credits and changes to the Universal Social Charge (USC) rates and bands should help lower the tax burden on individuals.  In general, changes to the 20-percent band and increases to basic personal tax credits could result in a minimum tax reduction of €650 p.a. for higher-income earners.
In cases of assignments to Ireland where assignees are subject to Irish taxation, and for Irish assignees working outside Ireland but still subject to Irish taxation, international assignment cost projections and budgeting should reflect the changes (when they come into effect) described in this newsletter.  Where appropriate, adjustments to gross-up packages and withholding taxes may need to be considered.  Each individual’s tax status should be determined in light of his or her particular situation.
Other Budget 2025 measures such as pension auto-enrolment and amendments to the Small Benefit Exemption are likely to have implications for employers and their current processes and controls in these areas.  Employers should be proactive in reviewing their current processes/controls, considering actions/decisions to be taken, and consulting their tax advisers where necessary.

Income Tax 
The 20-percent standard rate band will increase by €2,000 to €44,000 for Single Persons, with proportionate increases for other taxpayers like Single Parents and Married Couples/Civil Partnerships.
The Personal Tax Credit, Employee PAYE Tax Credit, and Earned Income Credit (Self-Employed Person) will be increased from €1,875 to €2,000.
Increases in various other tax credits including the Home Carer Tax Credit (from €1,800 to €1,950), Single Person Child Carer Tax Credit (from €1,750 to €1,900), Incapacitated Child Tax Credit (from €3,500 to €3,800), Blind Tax Credit (from €1,650 to €1,950), and the Dependant Relative Tax Credit from €245 to €305.
The Rental Tax Credit will increase from €750 to €1,000 for a Single Person, renting from a third-party landlord.  It will now be possible to retrospectively claim the increase of €250 for the current 2024 tax year.  Similar benefits apply for jointly-assessed couples where up to €2,000 will be available as a Rental Tax Credit.
Extension of the Mortgage Interest Relief Credit available in 2023 to 2024 on a retrospective basis.  When in effect, this had applied to qualifying mortgages where there had been an increase in the interest paid between the base year 2022.  Claims are expected to be made through the 2024 personal tax return. 
Employment Benefits 
The Small Benefit Exemption (SBE) has been amended to allow employers to treat the first five minor and irregular non-cash benefits in the year, which cumulatively do not exceed an annual limit of €1,500, as tax free.  Previously, the maximum tax-free amount was €1,000 and applied to only the first two such benefits in the year.

KPMG INSIGHTS
While a welcome improvement, it does not alleviate the administrative burden on employers who are required to track non-taxable SBE amounts for Enhanced Employer Reporting Obligations and taxable amounts for payroll or PAYE Settlement Agreement (PSA) purposes.

Employer-Provided Vehicles
A new tax exemption will apply in relation to employer-paid installation costs for electric vehicle (EV) home chargers.
For 2025, the calculation of the imputed benefit-in-kind (BIK) on employer-provided vehicles (EV or fossil fuel) will remain the same as in 2024.  It will remain possible to deduct an additional €10,000 from the Original Market Value of the vehicle whose CO2 emissions fall into the A-D category before the application of the relevant imputed BIK rate.
Special Assignee Relief Programme (SARP)
No specific measures were announced in relation to SARP relief.  The tax relief currently applies for qualifying employees who come to Ireland prior to 31 December 2025, having been nonresident for at least five consecutive tax years.
The Budget 2025 announcement, however, did include a report prepared by the Irish Revenue providing statistical analysis relating to the most popular originating countries of claimants, nationalities, and broad income levels of claimants.

KPMG INSIGHTS
It may be the case that the extension and other amendments to the relief will be provided for in the Finance Bill.  We will advise of these as soon the Bill is published.

Universal Social Charge (USC)
No change to the exemption limit of €13,000 p.a.
No change announced to the €12,012, 0.5-percent USC rate band.
An increase in the 2-percent USC rate band from €25,760 to €27,382, and a reduction in the 4-percent USC rate band to 3 percent.  No change to the 8-percent rate which applies at €70,044 of gross income.
No change to the 3-percent surcharge (11 percent) applying to non-payroll income or self-employed income which exceeds €100,000 p.a.
Average reductions in USC are in excess of €400 for those earning over €70,044 p.a.
Pay Related Social Insurance (PRSI)
While no changes were announced on Budget Day, readers are reminded that employer and employee rates will incrementally increase on 1 October annually, commencing in 2024.  For further details, please see GMS Flash Alert 2024-156 (25 July 2024).  
PensionsStandard Fund Threshold (SFT)
While not included in the Budget Speech, in September, the Minister for Finance published the report of the independent examination of the Standard Fund Threshold (SFT) for pensions.2  The report made a number of recommendations to modernise and update the operation of the SFT.

KPMG INSIGHTS
It is expected these matters will be included in the Finance Bill.  The government has committed to implementing many of these recommendations in a multi-year plan.  The plan includes:
Phased increases in the SFT of €200,000 per year, from 2026 until 2029, and then converging the level of SFT with the applicable level of growth.  This would increase the SFT to €2.8 million in 2029.
The rate of Chargeable Excess Tax (CET) is to remain unchanged with a specific review of the rate to take place by 2030.  The report recommends a reduction of the CET rate to a level to make sure the effective rate on the excess benefits over the threshold is not less than the top marginal rate of tax.  In current circumstances, a CET rate of 10 percent would be sufficient to achieve this, rather than the current rate of 40 percent.
The report also recommends revised valuation factors, taking into account the different types of pensions to which the factors apply, and in particular, the different types of benefits that are provided.  The minister noted that an independent evaluation of the age-related valuation factors proposed will be undertaken.
The threshold for the higher rate of taxation to apply to a pension lump sum will be limited to €500,000, rather than a proportion of the SFT.
An inter-agency group will be formed to oversee the implementation of the remaining recommendations.

Pension Auto-Enrolment for Employees 
Over the summer, the Automatic Enrolment Retirement Savings Systems Act (AE) was passed into law.3  The aim of AE is to establish a new retirement savings scheme to provide a financial retirement plan for employees who are not already part of a pension-related regime.  The new regime will not apply to those in “exempt employment,” i.e., where contributions are being made to a qualifying pension scheme, Personal Retirement Savings Account (PRSA), or qualifying trust Retirement Annuity Contract (RAC).
Budget 2025 confirms that the roll-out of this new pension arrangement is expected to apply from September 2025.
Further, it was announced that the Finance Bill will provide for relevant taxation measures associated with the new AE scheme.  It has already been announced that there will be no income tax relief for employee contributions to the AE scheme (as the state is making a top-up contribution directly to the scheme instead); employers will receive tax relief for their contributions and growth in the AE funds will be exempt from tax.  It is expected that retirees will be taxable on the annuities payable from the AE funds, like other arrangements.

KPMG INSIGHTS
Other Tax Measures for Clarification
Some of the other tax matters awaiting clarification include: 
Whether accrued AE benefits are deductible when calculating the amount of tax exemption available to an employee on termination of an employment,    
The impact for nonresident employees, and  
Whether employees participating in a foreign pension plan but working in Ireland and liable to Irish payroll withholding can be considered in an exempt employment to avoid the need for inclusion in the AE arrangement.
Potential Impact of AE on Business Travellers and Expatriates
In light of the above, the tax measures to be published in the Finance Bill will be important to review to determine whether short-term business visitors or expatriates working in Ireland temporarily may be in scope of AE, notwithstanding contributions are paid to an overseas pension arrangement.  Additional cost considerations arise for the employee and employer, as well as the potential Irish and home-location tax impact of accrued AE benefits in such cases, could arise in the absence of a specific exemption.

Share-Based Remuneration
To coincide with Budget Day, the Department of Finance published a commissioned report which reviewed the Irish taxation of share-based remuneration.4  The report contains a number of recommendations for the government to consider including measures to foster Ireland’s standing as a good place for employees and employers to be based. 
No timeframe was given in the Budget announcements in relation to any changes to current tax measures which may be made by the government on foot of the report.
The report makes several recommendations that are designed to improve Ireland’s competitive position, which include:
The tax treatment of restricted stock units (RSUs) for internationally-mobile employees should be moved to a sourcing or apportionment method aligned with the approach used internationally and aligned with the treatment of stock options for internationally-mobile employees.
Short-term measures to enhance the attractiveness of the Key Employee Engagement Programme (KEEP) by providing greater clarity and guidance to Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) on share valuations for KEEP.  Further, the report recommends that consideration should be given to wider amendments and a re-design of KEEP post-2025.
Simplification of reporting for share-based remuneration to reduce administrative costs and increase the attractiveness of share schemes. As part of this, the report recommends that consideration be given to adopting a pre-notification system for approval of Approved Profit Share Schemes by Revenue.
A reduced BIK rate on loans to employees to fund the costs associated with the purchase of shares in share-based remuneration schemes.  The current rate for such loans is 13.5 percent, with a taxable BIK arising on the difference between the interest paid, if any, and the interest which would have been payable at the 13.5-percent rate.  The report suggests the rate could be linked to market interest rates.
Reform of Employee Ownership Trusts arrangements to align Ireland with the tax treatment of such trusts in the United Kingdom.

KPMG INSIGHTS
The report also recommends that consideration be given to introducing a cap on the employer PRSI exemption for share-based remuneration, with a view to containing the growth in the cost to the Exchequer of share-based remuneration schemes.  Such a change would serve to increase the cost for companies of running employee share schemes, and potentially reduce the attractiveness of these schemes for SMEs in particular, which would appear to be in direct conflict with the aim of the recommendations noted above.

Capital Gains Tax (CGT)
No specific measures were announced that are relevant for employees or internationally-mobile employees, but the following items should be noted:
The CGT relief for “angel investors” in certain innovative start-ups is being enhanced by increasing the lifetime limit on gains to which relief applies, from €3 million to €10 million.
The extension of the upper age limit to 70 in the context of Retirement Relief is being retained.  Changes are also being made to provide for a clawback of the relief where within 12 years of receiving the assets, there are disposals by the child or children and the proceeds are €10 million or more.  Where the child or children retain the assets for more than 12 years, CGT will be fully abated.
The Employment Investment Incentive (EII) scheme, Start-Up Relief for Entrepreneurs, and the Start-Up Capital Incentive schemes are to all be extended for two years up to the end of 2026.  The EII scheme is also being enhanced by doubling the amount in respect of which an investor can claim relief, from €500,000 to €1 million.  The amount of relief available under the Start-Up Relief for Entrepreneurs is also being increased, with the limit rising from €700,000 to €980,000.
Capital Acquisitions Tax (CAT)
In general, once the disponer or recipient of a gift or inheritance is Irish resident or ordinarily resident, the beneficiary will be liable to CAT on worldwide assets once the aggregate value received exceeds the lifetime relationship threshold between the parties.  Exceptions to this rule include gifts/inheritances between spouses (which are wholly exempt), while a measure of relief is available to qualifying non-domiciled individuals.
No changes were announced to the CAT rate of 33 percent, but increases have been made to the lifetime tax-free thresholds as outlined below.
Group A (Parent-Child): from €335,000 to €400,000
Group B (Siblings; Uncle/Aunt to Niece/Nephew): from €32,500 to €40,000
Group C (Other): from €16,250 to €20,000.

https://kpmg.com/xx/en/our-insights/regulatory-insights/the-fca-supervisory-priorities-for-asset-managers.html,Regulatory Insights,The FCA’s portfolio letter and supervisory priorities for asset managers,,"Introduction

The FCA has published its latest ""portfolio letter
opens in a new tab
"" (PDF 173 KB) and supervisory strategy for “mainstream” asset managers and fund managers, which supersedes the previous letter published in January 2020. The FCA's priorities for ""alternative"" asset managers were set out separately last year.

Underlying an overarching focus on good governance, the FCA's revised supervisory priorities include ESG, product liquidity management, product governance, investment in operations and resilience, and financial resilience. ESG and financial resilience are new priorities, while LIBOR transition and EU withdrawal have dropped off the list.

CEOs and boards need to take action to ensure that their firms meet the FCA's expectations. The FCA also noted that it would engage in a policy discussion with firms. In that context it has now published a wide-ranging discussion paper
opens in a new tab
 (PDF 713 KB) that seeks stakeholder views on updating and improving the UK regime for asset management

The five key supervisory priorities and planned work

The FCA notes that ineffective governance can be a ""root cause"" of risks. It states that good governance ""is always an expectation"" and is particularly important given the current period of uncertainty. The FCA will therefore focus on assessing the effectiveness of firms' governance in identifying, considering and mitigating harms. It has identified five specific supervisory priorities.
1) Product Governance
The FCA reminds asset managers it undertook previous reviews on Assessment
opens in a new tab
 of Value and Product Governance
opens in a new tab
 which indicated areas where firms need to improve.
The FCA expects asset managers to meet the new Consumer Duty requirements where they ""determine or have a material influence"" over retail customer outcomes (see more on this in the FCA's sector-specific letter
opens in a new tab
) (PDF 203 KB). Previously, we set out some of the key considerations for asset managers in the context of Consumer Duty. Firms will also need to consider the findings
opens in a new tab
 from the FCA's cross-sector review of implementation plans.
The FCA plans:
To follow up on the 2021 Assessment of Value review findings, including considering ESG. The FCA will seek to identify “outlier” firms
In 2024, to review the embeddedness of Consumer Duty, focusing on price and value\
2) ESG and Sustainable Investing
The FCA expects asset managers to comply with its 2021 “Guiding Principles
opens in a new tab
” and that larger firms will publish TCFD disclosures by end-June 2023. It encourages firms to assess the extent to which net zero commitments have been considered in transition planning.
Firms will also need to pay close attention to the outputs from the FCA's consultation on proposed Sustainability Disclosure Requirements (see KPMG's summary here), and conclusions from its discussion paper on sustainable governance, incentives and competencies (see here).
The FCA will:
In the near future, publish the results of a review of some firms' ESG oversight practices
Focus its supervisory activity on governance structures that oversee ESG and stewardship considerations and test claims made to investors.
3) Product Liquidity Management
The FCA is concerned that fund managers have not always overseen or used liquidity management tools correctly or consistently. It expects fund managers to treat investors fairly when meeting redemption requests. The FCA's future policy approach is likely to be determined by the conclusions from the Financial Stability Board's and IOSCO's work in this area — see here for a summary of the latest global developments. Its discussion paper also seeks views on amending its rules and guidance around liquidity stress testing and clarifying its rules on liquidity management tools.
The FCA:
Is currently completing a liquidity management multi-firm review
Will continue to work with the Bank of England to strengthen the resilience of the sector and certain types of funds
4) Investment in Operations & Resilience

Firms need to understand the ""operational health"" of their business and have sufficient oversight of third parties. Firms should review their policies and procedures and ensure they are meeting their incident reporting obligations, as well as the rules on business services and impact tolerances.

The FCA plans to ""complete a range of proactive programmes"" and may select firms for further review.
5) Financial Resilience
The FCA reminds firms that they should have sufficient capital and liquidity, good governance, and should comply with the CASS rules. Wind-down plans should be reviewed with reference to the FCA's wind down planning guide
opens in a new tab
 and observations
opens in a new tab
. In January, we published the findings of our latest risk and ICARA Benchmarking survey, which provides useful pointers for firms.
The FCA will:
Continue to assess firms' prudential health via data collection and will conduct targeted monitoring visits
In H1 2023, publish initial observations on firms' IFPR implementation

Implications for asset managers and fund managers

These priorities clearly signal the FCA's areas of supervisory focus. CEOs and boards should review the letter to ensure they understand the FCA's expectations and compare their governance arrangements, as well as specific policies and procedures, with the matters set out in these areas of focus. Where necessary, firms should put in place actions to address shortcomings.

And for good reason: insurance CEOs are dealing with a complex set of pressures and challenges — growth, digital transformation, talent and sustainability — that require bold decisions and concrete action. Decisions made today will help to shape the business well into the future.

However, despite economic headwinds, insurance CEOs are confident that they will be able to grow their business over the next three years — both in terms of earnings and headcount. But competition is growing, and organizations are pulling several levers to drive the growth they require. CEOs are highly focused on accelerating their digital transformation, delivering on their ESG agenda and enhancing productivity. And at the same time, they recognize the need to infuse the organization with new talent and to embrace new technologies — Gen AI in particular — if they hope to achieve their growth objectives.

Key findings from our research

Methodology

The KPMG 2024 Insurance CEO Outlook, part of the 10th edition of the KPMG 2024 CEO Outlook, is compiled from the views of 120 insurance chief executive officers, which was conducted between 25 July and 29 August 2024, providing unique insight into the mindset, strategies, and planning tactics of CEOs.
All respondents oversee companies with annual revenues over US$500M and a third of the companies surveyed have more than US$10B in annual revenue. The survey included CEOs from 11 key markets (Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Spain, UK and US) and 11 key industry sectors, including insurance. NOTE: some figures may not add up to 100 percent due to rounding.
In the insurance sector research, the two largest sub-sectors were Auto, Home, Property and Casualty with 31 percent of respondents and life insurers with 30 percent. The best-represented countries based on organizational headquarters are the US and the UK, followed by China, India and Canada.

https://kpmg.com/xx/en/our-insights/regulatory-insights/developing-regulation-to-support-safe-and-responsible-ai-adoption.html,Regulatory Insights,Developing regulation to support safe and responsible AI adoption,,"The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) in financial services may enable firms to offer better products and services to consumers, improve operational efficiency and risk management, increase revenue and drive innovation. However, it can also pose new challenges for firms and regulators and amplify existing risks. 
The regulatory landscape has been developing across the EU and the UK (see our previous article
opens in a new tab
) and the Bank of England (BoE), PRA and FCA have now published a joint Discussion Paper (DP) on the regulation of AI and ML in UK financial services. 
The use of AI and ML in financial services is evolving rapidly, with implications for consumers, firms, markets and the supervisory authorities. Adoption is ramping up both within established financial services firms and in newer fintech and Insurtech companies and through partnerships and investment with smaller AI-specific vendors.
Firms are applying AI/ML to more material business areas and use cases — from anti-money laundering and credit and regulatory capital modelling in banking to claims management, product innovation and pricing and capital reserve modelling in insurance to order routing/execution and influencing portfolio management decisions in investment management.
They are also using more complex AI/ML techniques, often linked to the use of increasing volumes of data and the quest for improved performance and delivery of better customer outcomes. Over time, the complexity and sophistication of models are likely to increase further. 
AI is used across many other sectors of the economy. The UK Government, through the Office of AI, is expected to issue a White Paper on regulating AI in late 2022/early 2023.

Building on the work of the AIPPF

The DP follows the February 2022 final report (PDF 12.4MB) of the AI Public-Private Forum (AIPPF) which was convened by the BoE and the FCA in 2020 to promote dialogue on AI innovation and its safe adoption within financial services. 
The work of the AIPPF was structured around three key areas of the AI lifecycle — data, model risk and governance. AI risk can arise in each of these areas within interconnected AI systems and could ultimately pose risks to the whole financial system. 
The final report explored the various barriers to adoption of AI, the challenges and risks in each of the key areas, and possible solutions. The report concluded that clarifying regulatory expectations, including the application of existing regulation on the adoption and use of AI, would be a key component in fostering innovation. The AIPPF also recommended that regulators should identify the most important and/or high-risk use cases for financial services in order to develop appropriate mitigation strategies and policy initiatives. Formal consultation was proposed on industry best practice or guidelines, with suggestions also that it could be beneficial for an industry consortium to develop solutions and industry-wide standards, and for AI practitioners to be certified.

Aims and structure of the DP

The new DP picks up on the work of the AIPPF, in particular the issues of clarity around both existing and future regulation. It aims to share and obtain feedback on:
(i) The potential benefits and risks related to the use of AI 
(ii) How the current regulatory framework applies to AI
(iii) Whether additional clarification of existing regulation may be helpful
(iv) How policy can best support further safe and responsible AI adoption
Chapters 1 to 3 cover, respectively, the structure of the DP, the regulators' objectives and remits (including definitions of AI and the AI lifecycle, and context on how AI is increasingly used), and the risks and benefits of AI. 
Potentially of most interest to firms, and where the most feedback is requested, is Chapter 4. This details rules, regulations, principles and guidance and considers the ways in which they could be relevant in supporting the objectives of the regulators — consumer protection, safety and soundness, insurer policy protection, financial stability and market integrity, and promoting competition — while mitigating AI risks. For example, it discusses whether the incoming  FCA Consumer Duty and other FCA Principles would require firms to be able to monitor, explain and justify where their AI models result in differences in price and value for different cohorts of customers. 
Chapter 5 summarises the regulators' questions. These focus on three main areas: supervisory authorities' objectives and remits, the benefits and risks of AI (and where supervisory action should be prioritised) and regulation — specifically whether AI can be safely and responsibly adopted under the existing legal and regulatory framework.
The feedback period closes on 10 February 2023.

What does the DP mean for firms?

The DP asks a significant number of open-ended questions and seeks to garner feedback from the industry to see whether fine-tuning is needed to the existing regulatory framework, or whether a new approach is required. A similar approach was taken with the FCA's first Consumer Duty consultation, which was followed by a more fully-formed paper once industry views had been gathered.
A follow up speech by Jessica Rusu, the FCA's Chief Data, Information and Intelligence Officer, provided further insights regarding the FCA's likely direction of travel, focusing on firms' responsibility and accountability in relation to the use of AI. She suggested that UK financial regulators already have a framework — the Senior Managers and Certification Regime (SMCR) — that can be applied to the regulatory challenges posed by AI. Responsibility for the management of AI risks should lie with firms—there is a risk of treating AI as autonomous or having agency, which could appear to remove accountability for decision-making away from senior managers. The DP asks whether, and how, creating a new Prescribed Responsibility for AI to be allocated to a Senior Management Function (SMF) would be helpful in enhancing effective governance of AI. It also asks whether further guidance on the 'reasonable steps' element of the SMCR, in an AI context, would be helpful.  
Rusu also emphasised that firms' governance frameworks around the use of AI should address the following challenges:
1. Responsibility — who monitors, controls and supervises the design, development, deployment and evaluation of AI models
2. Creating a framework for dealing with novel challenges, such as AI explainability
3. How effective governance contributes to the creation of a community of stakeholders with a shared skill set and technical understanding 
Finally, Rusu stressed the importance of high-quality data to drive good AI outcomes and that the use of data must be compliant with data protection legislation.

Looking ahead

Although there is still some way to go in fully understanding and clarifying requirements for the management and mitigation of AI risks in financial services, a regulatory path is slowly emerging, with many of the building blocks already in place. The safe and effective adoption of AI will require a regulatory approach that builds, maintains and reinforces trust at all stages of the lifecycle, for practitioners, end customers and supervisors. Given the potential conduct, market, prudential and resilience impacts, all firms using or consider using AI models should take the opportunity to engage with this discussion.

Its discussion paper
opens in a new tab
 (DP) begins the conversation on the extent to which additional regulatory expectations or guidance should be used to accelerate the move to sustainable finance for regulated firms.
The paper poses questions around how sustainability-related considerations should be embedded in regulated firms' objectives, strategies, culture, governance, operations, decision-making processes, incentives and senior managers' responsibilities. It also seeks to gather views on how the governance and resourcing of stewardship can be strengthened and where competence-related barriers in financial services may impede progress.

Context

The FCA's considerations build on a variety of regulations already in place. Existing FCA rules require premium and standard listed companies and certain asset owners and asset managers to publish information on how they have incorporated climate-related risks into their governance and risk management processes, as part of their TCFD-aligned disclosures. However, through its proposed Sustainability Disclosure Requirements (SDR, see KPMG article here), the FCA is now exploring how to incorporate a much broader definition of sustainability-related risks — such as nature and biodiversity, human rights and modern slavery — into firms' governance and risk management frameworks.
Wider stakeholder initiatives are also underway. For example, the Transition Plan Taskforce's draft disclosure framework may raise the bar further for in-scope firms to maintain effective governance structures over their greenhouse gas emissions. The DP brings aspects of some of these initiatives together for industry consideration.
The FCA is also considering where it could build on broader regimes, such as the Senior Managers and Certification Regime (SM&CR) and the Consumer Duty. And while, to date, its sustainability-related requirements have focused mainly on regulated asset managers and asset owners, the focus has now shifted onto developing requirements for all regulated firms.

Potential changes to deliver sustainable change

The FCA's paper explores the potential for regulatory enhancements to support the embedding of sustainability considerations in various aspects of regulated firms' businesses. These can be grouped broadly into three themes:
1. Tone from the top
The FCA is exploring ways to integrate sustainability-related risks at all stages of the governance process — not only how firms set their strategic objectives, but also how culture can act as an enabler and how the effectiveness of firms' governance can be integrated into the regulatory framework. 
 Objectives, purpose and strategy: The FCA wants to understand whether firms are setting sustainability-related objectives and building these into their business models and strategies. The PRA already expects the boards of dual-regulated firms to understand how their firms are integrating climate considerations into their approach. The FCA seems to be considering both broadening the scope of firms that will need to consider such matters (i.e. beyond dual-regulated to all regulated firms), and extending these requirements beyond climate change to wider sustainability-related considerations.
Culture and behaviours: The FCA emphasises the importance of a healthy culture and asks whether it should set expectations on how firms' culture and behaviours can support sustainable change. It notes growing investor interest in disclosing and improving diversity and inclusion practices.
Governance: The FCA asks how firms are ensuring that they have the right skills and knowledge within their boards relating to climate-change and sustainability risks and opportunities, what are likely to be the most effective strategies for embedding these considerations in firms' operations, and how management information (MI) can be used to monitor developments and progress against public commitments. It is looking to gather views on whether regulatory guidance or expectations are needed in these areas.
Accountability: The FCA notes that, while the PRA already expects dual-regulated firms to allocate responsibility for managing financial risks from climate change to a Senior Management Function (SMF), there are currently no similar requirements for solo-regulated firms. The FCA asks whether more guidance is needed and which SMF would be most suitable to take on sustainability-related responsibilities.
 2. Sustainable products and directing capital
Firms can effect positive and sustainable change in their own business processes and can also play an important role in responsibly allocating, managing and overseeing the investments of their customers. The FCA is considering how further guidance and requirements could drive improvements in this area.
Product governance: The FCA notes that its existing product governance handbook (PROD) does not currently contain explicit references to sustainability, although SDR will require firms to maintain appropriate governance arrangements over in-scope products. The FCA asks whether specific expectations should be introduced around the governance of products with sustainability characteristics. Interestingly, the FCA specifically proposes clarifying the roles and expectations of fund boards.
Stewardship: Although there are existing requirements under the Shareholder Rights Directive, and certain firms must `comply or explain' in the context of the Stewardship Code, the FCA believes there are still barriers that prevent stewardship from taking a more prominent role in the investment approach. The paper seeks views on whether further measures are needed to encourage effective stewardship, whether there are any regulatory barriers, and whether additional measures would encourage firms to identify and respond to market-wide and systemic risks. For a deeper look at trends driving the increasing focus on stewardship reporting, see KPMG's latest article here.
 3. Workforce management, competence and incentives
Effective delivery of sustainable business objectives does not just rely on top-down governance. The FCA is seeking to understand the extent to which regulatory expectations can facilitate the incentivisation of workforces and greater competence to deliver effective sustainability-related strategies.
Remuneration and incentives: Existing codes require remuneration to promote effective risk management, including ESG risks under the MIFIDPRU Remuneration Code for in-scope firms. The FCA is seeking to understand the extent to which regulatory expectations can support firms in incentivising their staff to deliver effective sustainability-related strategies and how remuneration can be linked to sustainability-related metrics. It asks which matters firms should take into consideration when designing remuneration and incentive plans linked to their sustainability-related objectives, and what further guidance could be needed.
Training and competence: The FCA is concerned that the ability of staff to drive positive sustainable change could be constrained by knowledge gaps and `competence washing' (i.e. a lack of sustainability-related subject matter expertise). It therefore seeks views on:
 The main sustainability-related knowledge gaps and how they can be addressed.
 The need for additional training and competence expectations.
Aspects of training that would be particularly useful.
Whether stakeholders have seen misrepresentation of ESG credentials and the potential harms.

Comparison with existing EU requirements

To some extent, the questions raised by the FCA suggest that it might consider introducing requirements that cover similar ground to existing EU rules that have applied to UCITS Management Companies, AIFMs and MiFID investment firms since 2022. These require firms to integrate sustainability risks and factors into their investment processes, decision-making, risk management, resourcing considerations, due diligence and conflicts of interest management.
Additionally, EU MiFID investment firms must understand and incorporate `sustainability preferences' into their investment advice and suitability processes, and consider sustainability factors and risks in their product governance frameworks. In its SDR consultation, the FCA announced plans to consult on rules for financial advisers to incorporate sustainability matters and investor preferences when delivering investment advice.

Looking ahead

This DP indicates a willingness on the part of the FCA to consider significant changes to existing regulatory regimes to facilitate a transition to sustainable finance, and an openness to introducing new regulatory requirements to help realise the necessary changes to all aspects of a firm's business. As well as exploring the possibility for new requirements, the FCA specifically encourages firms to consider reflecting the matters discussed in their approaches to governance, remuneration, incentives and training.
Firms should therefore seek to understand the extent to which their existing sustainability-related strategies and business processes could be enhanced by the proposals in the paper. Firms can start to prepare by considering how existing governance structures may need to be adjusted, how all three lines of defence can factor the FCA's considerations into forward-looking work on this topic, and where upskilling is particularly needed or resources need to be increased.
Although there is uncertainty around how the FCA's considerations could translate into future requirements, in some areas enhancements to the UK regime could be progressed more quickly to respond to some of the questions posed. This could particularly be the case where similar requirements already exist in the EU, considering lessons learned. But in any case, firms will need to prepare to navigate any differences between UK and EU regimes.

Sometimes two things appear to perform a similar function. For example, Celsius and Fahrenheit; Degrees and Radians; VHS and Betamax. The world is then faced with a choice: keep both, or converge on a common standard? This was the nature of the decision facing the European Commission, with respect to MREL & TLAC, when it published updated drafts to its key legal texts on resolution (BRRD & SRMR) in November 2016.
Highlights
FSB’s Key Attributes of Effective Resolution Regimes are the starting point for MREL and TLAC
How to implement TLAC into EU law?
Resolution group concept & ‘internal MREL’
Conclusion

FSB’s Key Attributes of Effective Resolution Regimes are the starting point for MREL and TLAC

By way of a reminder, MREL (Minimum Requirement for Own Funds & Eligible Liabilities) is the EU standard for ‘bail-in’ capital, introduced via the 2014 BRRD/SRMR package.  In chronology, MREL came before TLAC.  It is a broad bail-in standard, as BRRD applies to all EU banks, and is effective since January 2016.
TLAC, by contrast, is a global standard applicable to G-SIB banks only. It was introduced by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) and defined in a ‘Term Sheet’ in November 2015.  It therefore came later, but has a global reach, with G20 sponsorship. TLAC will enter into effect on 1 January 2019.
In a sense both MREL and TLAC are tributaries of the same source, namely the FSB’s Key Attributes
opens in a new tab
 of Effective Resolution Regimes, published in 2011 (updated 2014). This landmark document sets out principles for resolution powers, crisis management and resolution planning. MREL and TLAC both address banks’ loss-absorbency and recapitalization capacity under this framework.
At the time of writing, MREL is part of EU law, whereas TLAC is not, hence an imperative for the European Commission to update its legal framework.
There are also significant differences between the two initial standards, including but not limited to:
Minimum requirements: as set out in our earlier article, TLAC has prescriptive minimum levels for all G-SIBs, beginning with 16% of RWA and 6% of the Basel III leverage ratio denominator in 2019.  MREL is, however, defined bank-by-bank by EU resolution authorities (SRB, NRAs), taking account of whether a bank would be liquidated or resolved if it were to fail.
Eligible instruments: TLAC is more prescriptive on the type of instruments that are eligible; it requires that such instruments be clearly subordinated to ‘excluded’ instruments (contractually, statutorily, structurally). MREL is a deliberately broad standard, recognising that across all EU banks, many types of debt will be used and different insolvency hierarchies exist (though this list is expected to narrow somewhat under BRRD 2).
Denominator: TLAC is calculated as a percentage of Risk Weighted Assets (RWAs), like CET1 capital. MREL was designed as a percentage of total liabilities and own funds, so conceptually closer to a leverage ratio for bail-in capital requirements.

How to implement TLAC into EU law?

The Commission considered different options in preparing its proposal to update the BRRD and SRMR to implement TLAC into EU law:
Applying TLAC to all banks? This would be an elegant solution in some respects, but lacks ‘proportionality’, as rules designed for G-SIBs (circa 30 banks globally) would then become applicable to all European banks (of which there are nearly 6,000).
Applying MREL but not TLAC to EU banks? This was not legally possible, given G20 commitments to implement a common TLAC framework across G-SIB banks.
Revising MREL to incorporate TLAC features, while continuing to have two distinct standards? This is, in effect, the strategy which that has been chosen. Under the Commission’s draft proposals, MREL will be enhanced in the following ways: 
The denominator will be switched to RWAs and a Basel III leverage ratio floor, mirroring TLAC.
The concept of ‘resolution groups’ which is central to TLAC, will be applied to EU resolution groups. This will replace the existing requirement to set MREL individually for all EU banking entities (both parents & subsidiaries).
Introduce the concept of ‘external MREL’ and ‘internal MREL’. This links directly with the concept of resolution groups.
Introduce a partial harmonization of the bank insolvency creditor hierarchy across the EU, by creating a new class of ‘non-preferred’ senior debt instruments that would be bailed-in in resolution after capital and other subordinated instruments but before other senior liabilities, and would rank behind other senior liabilities under national insolvency laws. Non-preferred senior debt instruments would be eligible to meet minimum TLAC and MREL requirements.

Resolution group concept & ‘internal MREL’

By way of analogy, under the original MREL standard, each EU bank (parent or subsidiary) was like a town required to maintain its own emergency water supply. It could not rely on an ‘upstream’ reservoir belonging to its parent.
Under TLAC, however, banks form part of resolution groups and only the resolution entity (the parent) has a reservoir of ‘external TLAC’. There are then arrangements to distribute that loss-absorbency capacity through internal instruments (internal TLAC), which can technically be bailed-in without putting the subsidiary into resolution.
The ‘external’ and ‘internal’ TLAC concepts have been introduced into MREL in the latest drafts. For EU subsidiaries of non-EU G-SIBs, internal MREL is to be set at 90% of the ‘external’ MREL requirement, which is at the upper end of the 75-90% range for internal TLAC, per the FSB’s term sheet.

Conclusion

If the new drafts of BRRD and SRMR are passed into law, while there will continue to be two bail-in standards in Europe - MREL (for all banks) and TLAC (for G-SIBs only) - the two will be much closer than they were previously. We expect this development to be welcomed by the sector.

The ECB is developing new guidance aimed at harmonising European banks’ approaches to their ICAAP and ILAAP processes. The new guidance is based on seven key principles and is expected to enter full force within two years. It will have a varying impact on different banks, but all are likely to require significant changes to their internal processes and reporting requirements. Management boards will also be expected to take full responsibility. Given the short timeframe, banks need start planning their responses now.
The Basel Committee requires banks to assess themselves the capital cushion and liquidity buffers they need to support current and future risks. The results of the Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) and Internal Liquidity Adequacy Assessment Process (ILAAP) as developed by the banks are reviewed by supervisors during the annual Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP).
In the years before the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM), Europe’s national supervisors have taken different approaches to reviewing banks’ ICAAP and ILAAP calculations. This is set to change. The ECB is developing comprehensive guidance for Significant Institutions, with the aims of improving convergence between ICAAP and ILAAP and enhancing harmonisation across the SSM.

The ECB published their initial expectations for a harmonized ICAAP and ILAAP in January 2017. The consultation period on the seven principles of the new guidance ends on May 31, 2017, and the ECB may make further changes in response to the 2017 Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP). Banks will need to implement the principles by the end of 2018. Given past experiences with draft EBA and ECB guidelines, we believe that full compliance will be expected for the SREP in 2019. The seven principles of the new guidance can be summarised as follows:
Management bodies are responsible for ICAAP & ILAAP. Management boards, senior managers and risk committees need to take full ownership of the processes and also the capital adequacy statement and liquidity adequacy statement, respectively.
The ICAAP & ILAAP are integral to risk management frameworks. The processes should be aligned with group risk appetite and look not just at the current situation, but also at least three years ahead.
The ICAAP & ILAAP aim to ensure the institution’s short and medium-term viability. Institutions need to make their assessments from two different perspectives, which are intended to be mutually informative.
The normative perspective is based on the ability to fulfil supervisory requirements. For capital this includes key ratios such as CET 1, Tier 1, and leverage; for liquidity it includes the LCR. The normative view should consider the short term position but also look forward three years or more, including a baseline scenario and at least two adverse scenarios.
The economic perspective is based on the bank’s economic or net present value. As such, it should consider the wide range of possible risks that a potential shareholder might consider. This includes taking ‘hidden’ or off-balance sheet liabilities into account.
The ICAAP and ILAAP should identify and consider all material risks. Institutions are expected to address any potential threats to their capital or liquidity positions, according to their business model.
Capital and liquidity need to be clearly defined, and of high quality. In the case of capital, common equity is expected to play a major role. Liquidity buffers should be marketable and well diversified.
Assumptions and methodologies need to be proportionate, consistent and thoroughly validated. Each bank’s approach to ICAAP and ILAAP should be appropriate for its business model and risk appetite. Assumptions should be conservative, independently validated and consistent across the whole group.
Regular stress tests should ensure viability under adverse market conditions. Internal stress tests should be conducted at least once a year, based on in-depth review of potential vulnerabilities.
These principles are unlikely to change materially, and give us a good idea of the impact of the ECB’s new approach. We see several potentially significant consequences for banks.
These principles are unlikely to change materially, and give us a good idea of the impact of the ECB’s new approach. We see several potentially significant consequences for banks.
First, the harmonising effect of the new guidance means that its impact will vary widely between national markets. Banks whose national supervisors have taken a different view from the ECB’s planned approach may need to make significant changes. To a varying degree, these changes include a re-design of the KPIs and KRIs used in capital and liquidity management. We expect the regular updates of three year business plans, capital plans and liquidity plans under normal and stressed scenarios to be a significant challenge, especially when combined with incorporating these KPIs and KRIs into the limit systems that banks use for day to day operations.
Second, two processes - ICAAP and ILAAP - that many banks currently perform separately will become closer, or even become merged. This reflects the reality that weaknesses in capital and liquidity are often mutually reinforcing. However it will pose some challenges, as ICAAP and ILAAP are frequently managed by different functions within a bank.

Third, the requirements for internal consistency could have a disproportionate impact on large cross-border banks and financial conglomerates. Diversified or decentralised groups may need to do much more work than others to ensure consistency and reconciliation.
Lastly, the ECB is raising the bar in terms of management responsibility. ICAAP and ILAAP are often approved at one or two levels below the board. In future, management boards will need to take responsibility for their submissions to supervisors.
In summary, the new guidelines on ICAAP and ILAAP give Significant Institutions a lot of food for thought. Some will need to make a number of technically complex changes across several functions and subsidiaries. Furthermore, these changes need to be assessed and planned urgently if banks are to achieve full implementation by the end of 2018.

The ECB is putting the harmonisation and strengthening of Institutions' ICAAPs at the heart of its priorities for 2019 and 2020. The new ICAAP guidance is in force and already applied to the SREP 2019. The ECB's ICAAP information gathering exercise, launched in June 2019, marks a new phase in the ECB's efforts to assess the quality of the ICAAPs across Europe. Deep-dives with JSTs and on-site investigations are likely to be used by the ECB to further deepen its understanding of banks' ICAAPs.
Internal capital adequacy assessment processes (the ICAAP) are at the heart of banks' capital management. Although ICAAP is purely an internal exercise, it plays a key role in the supervision of SSM banks providing input for the assessment of risks to capital as part of the annual Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP). Significant Institutions (SIs) provide the ECB with a comprehensive annual ICAAP package, including a wide range of quantitative and qualitative data. Ongoing review of the ICAAP enables supervisors to evaluate banks' ability to identify, assess, mitigate and report on their risks.
For much of the SSM's existence, approaches to ICAAP have continued to vary significantly between member states - partially a legacy of different national supervisors' historical approaches. The ECB has always been keen to harmonise ICAAPs and make them more comparable. But it's only been during the past three years that their efforts in this area have really taken hold.
This more concerted focus on the ICAAP began in 2016, with the ECB's publication of its initial guidance on supervisory expectations. That was followed in early 2017 with the publishing of the ICAAP multi-year plan. The ECB's new ICAAP and ILAAP guidance was finalised in late 2018, and is applicable to SREPs from the beginning of the current year.
The final guidance is very clear that the ECB intends to intensify its supervisory assessments of ICAAPs, and that they will play an increasingly important role in determining the Pillar II requirements of individual banks. This message is reinforced by the ECB's review of its 2018 supervisory activities, which highlights improvements in the quality and integration of ICAAPs as a continuing priority for the coming year. As stated by the ECB:
“In the future, the ICAAP and ILAAP are to play an even bigger role in the SREP, incentivising banks to keep improving their internal processes. Among other things, both the qualitative and quantitative aspects of the ICAAP will play an enhanced role in the determination of Pillar 2 own funds requirements on a risk-by-risk basis”
The same report indicated that the ECB had found “serious shortcomings” in the ICAAPs of more than half of SIs. Clearly, the ICAAP remains a challenging area for many banks. Among other areas, the ECB is believed to have detected the following shortcomings:
Underdeveloped stress-testing frameworks
Weaknesses in risk quantification methodologies
Material deficiencies in the integration of the ICAAP into the management framework
To facilitate improvements in banks' ICAAPs, the ECB's has developed and published guidelines that follow a principles-based approach. The ECB's final guide is derived from the ICAAP provisions of CRD IV. Seven principles are included, covering governance, integration of ICAAP in the overall management processes, revised quantitative frameworks introducing new perspectives (normative and economic internal perspectives) and stress testing. Implementing the guide presents some potential challenges for banks, such as including the normative and economic perspectives and aligning of the different stress testing programmes.
Furthermore, the ECB has recently begun a new data gathering exercise to better understand banks' approach to the ICAAP. Launched in June 2019, this aims to collect a wide range of credit and market risk related data, together with some qualitative information on the ICAAP process. Banks should note that this process may well become an annual exercise, and that it could be supplemented by on-site investigations focused on the ICAAP.
Banks should be in no doubt that the ICAAP is moving to the centre of the ECB's agenda, and that it will play an increasingly important role in determining their levels of supervisory capital. The ECB's ultimate goal of making ICAAPs more comparable will take time to achieve. For banks, the immediate priority should be to prepare for the enhanced scrutiny and increasingly demanding data requirements that are likely to be major themes over the next two years.

https://kpmg.com/xx/en/our-insights/operations/the-uk-s-overseas-funds-regime.html,Operations,The UK’s Overseas Funds Regime,,"October 2024
With the FCA having finalised its rules and guidance, the UK's Overseas Funds Regime (OFR) went live at the end of September 2024, following several years of development.
This article summarises how the OFR will operate and sets out practical next steps for EEA fund managers that are launching new funds or are seeking to transition existing funds into the new regime.

The OFR journey to date

At the end of the Brexit transition period, EEA funds lost their ability to passport into the UK. However, passporting funds were able to take advantage of the Temporary Marketing Permissions Regime (TMPR) that was established by the UK to provide continuity while permanent market access arrangements for funds were considered.
Although there is an existing way that overseas funds could have been recognised to market to UK retail investors (the FSMA s272 gateway), it is a relatively complex and onerous process, both for the FCA and fund managers. The scale of the challenge was also a factor, with over 8,000 EEA UCITS in the TMPR. As a result, the OFR was introduced to allow for streamlined access to market to UK retail investors, if the UK government finds the jurisdiction of the fund to be equivalent from an investor protection perspective (see FSMA s271B
opens in a new tab
).
Following the government's positive equivalence determination for EEA UCITS (including Exchange-Traded Funds, but excluding Money Market Funds), the laying of required legislation, and the FCA finalising its rules, the OFR will be up and running shortly.

The FCA's policy statement

Following its consultation (CP 23/26
opens in a new tab
), the FCA's final rules and guidance in policy statement PS 24/7
opens in a new tab
took effect from 31 July 2024 and set out how the FCA will operationalise the OFR and bring it to life from September. 
The final rules include requirements covering various topics, from the information and content to be included in applications for recognition, to the FCA's powers and fees that it will charge:

Compared to the consultation, only minor changes were made in the policy statement. 
Where the draft rules have been amended, the changes have generally been positive. For example, the FCA will now permit UK-authorised and OFR funds to have identical names, as long as the UK distribution channel makes the domicile of the fund sufficiently clear. And the FCA has removed the requirement to notify it 30 days in advance of certain changes taking effect in the UK — instead fund managers may in most cases notify the FCA `as soon as reasonably practical' after a change is approved by an EU regulator, or after wider changes or events have occurred.

What happens when?

The OFR will be rolled out in several stages:
30 September 2024: The OFR opens for new EEA funds that are not in the TMPR.
1 October 2024 — 31 December 2024: Stand-alone schemes in the TMPR can apply for recognition.
1 November 2024 — 30 September 2026: For umbrella funds in the TMPR, the FCA will assign landing slots to EEA fund managers in alphabetical order of the fund management company. Fund managers will be able to submit their applications at any time during their assigned three-month landing slot.
After applying for recognition and paying the application fee, the FCA has two months to make a decision.

Preparatory steps for fund managers

There are a range of tasks and activities that fund managers should be putting in motion now. These include straightforward matters, such as checking whether the FCA holds accurate contact details for the firm and if the fund population data held with the FCA is correct, to the more complex process of identifying and gathering the required information for applications in an efficient manner. 
Key next steps for fund managers include:
Gap analysis: A gap analysis should be performed against all the obligations in the final rules and guidance to map these against existing processes to identify where enhancements are needed, or new processes are required. For example, likely gaps will relate to fund prospectuses and the need to include further information about the status of the fund under the UK FOS and FSCS, and on how a UK investor can make a complaint. 
Operating model: The gap analysis should help inform the design of a target operating model or framework that underpins all aspects of the OFR application process and enables the delivery of applications at scale in an accurate and efficient manner. 
This should include the identification of relevant owners and stakeholders, any technology that will be used to support or automate aspects of the information gathering process, and governance arrangements that will oversee application approval and sign-off. 
The operating model should also be future-proofed to facilitate ongoing compliance and post-application processes, such as the identification and delivery of notifications to the FCA, as well as to cater for the recognition of newly launched funds in future once any initial project is stood down.
Review of EEA and UK product ranges: There may be some product-related efficiencies to be realised, now that there is certainty that EEA UCITS may be marketed to UK retail customers if they are recognised by the FCA. There is therefore a strategic opportunity for fund managers to review their respective ranges in the medium term.

The remaining pieces of the OFR puzzle

Although the OFR will commence shortly for EEA UCITS, some further developments can be expected:
Extension of the Sustainability Disclosure Requirements (SDR): Currently, overseas funds are out of scope of the FCA's SDR and are required to display a notice as such (you can read more on the SDR here). However, the UK government will consult soon on extending the SDR to OFR funds. 

Depending on the outcome of the government's consultation, and subject to associated FCA rules and guidance, any legislative requirements related to SDR for OFR funds are likely to come into force in the second half of 2025. This has the potential to be a challenging area, where some EEA funds may need to comply with both the EU SFDR and the UK SDR.
Money Market Funds (MMFs): Although EEA UCITS have been deemed to be equivalent under the OFR, the equivalence decision specifically excluded MMFs. This is because the UK is currently concluding a consultation on reforming and the UK MMF regime. The outcome will be particularly important, given the significant number and scale of sterling-denominated MMFs domiciled in the EEA in comparison to the UK.
Reforms to UK PRIIPs Packaged retail and insurance-based investment products Regulation: The UK has progressed plans to repeal the PRIIPs disclosure framework and to replace it with a modernised and streamlined disclosure framework based on the concept of Consumer Composite Investments (CCIs). Following an FCA consultation later this year, it is expected that OFR funds will be required to follow FCA rules under the new disclosure framework from 1 January 2027 at the latest.
Equivalence decisions for other jurisdictions: Although the UK and EU have similar rules governing UCITS (putting aside notable exceptions, such as the UK assessment of value requirements), it still required years of work and analysis to reach an equivalence decision for the EEA. While other jurisdictions may also be hoping to be granted equivalence, it appears unlikely that there will be any additional equivalence determinations, in the short term at least. 
Ongoing data reporting to the FCA: In future, the FCA plans to collect information from OFR funds to carry out its functions. However, it will undertake a review of data reporting for wider funds (including UK funds) first.

https://kpmg.com/xx/en/our-insights/ai-and-technology/twelve-tips-for-phone-safety.html,AI and Technology,Twelve tips for phone safety,,"Mobile phones have become an integral part of our lifestyles. Looking for the latest news or social media posts? In need of a camera, map, credit card or the time? How about a quick email check before doing a little shopping? The list goes on — you name it and your phone is there to provide it instantly. With their power and convenience comes responsibility; since the more it does, the more information it collects — leaving behind a digital record of every interaction and activity. That makes it so important for parents to educate children on best practices that will help ensure their security. Here are 12 tips to help kids use smart phones safely.
Set a strong password. Your child should take the time to create a strong password — or Face or Fingerprint ID — and not share it with anyone but a parent or trusted adult. Help them use multi-factor authentication and enable auto-lock, which kicks in after a set time. Remember: phones are miniature computers with personal information that needs protection.
Get permission to download. Great care should be taken when downloading apps. Kids, especially younger children, should check with a parent before doing so. After downloading an app, help them enable all privacy and location settings.
Only respond to familiar numbers. Kids should not answer a call or text from an unfamiliar number and never click links or call phone numbers in suspicious messages. They should especially avoid opening attachments from an unknown or untrusted source. If in doubt, kids should tell a parent or a trusted adult, who can report the problem and block the caller. They should be especially aware of not sending photos or videos to a stranger and never to meet strangers in person if asked.
You are what you communicate. Remember that everything shared by phone is public, so kids should think before hitting send. They should also never write a message or forward a photo or text that they wouldn’t want shared with everyone in school, their teachers or parents.
Ask before shooting and sharing. Kids should always ask before including someone in a photo or video, or before sharing a text. Ask your child: “How would you feel if someone took and forwarded an unflattering photo of you?”
Never broadcast a location. If an app asks to access your child’s location, say no. Apps can identify where kids are if GPS is enabled, as well as exactly where and when a picture was taken, whether at home, school or on vacation. Play it safe by disabling this function.
Be mindful. Help your child become aware of how much time is being spent on their phone each day, and to avoid feeling obligated to respond to every text or social media post right away. It’s good to take time away from phones and enjoy more time with friends and family. When doing homework, they should put their phone away — and not get distracted while walking outdoors or playing.
Keep it safe. Kids should remember to keep their phone charged — ideally charging overnight and in another room — and to protect it from spills, scratches and drops. They should be discreet as well. Keeping it tucked out of sight when not in use and never leaving it in a vehicle or unattended in public as they are an easy target for thieves.
Keep phone and tablets up to date. Regularly update operating systems, software and applications. Mobile operating system (OS) updates can include anything from a completely new version to a ‘patch’ or fix to strengthen security, remove bugs or improve functionality. Make sure your child knows to always update when prompted and turn on automatic updates if available.
Be careful with Bluetooth. Bluetooth technology can automatically link phones to nearby devices like wireless headphones, printers and keyboards. Advise your kids to turn off Bluetooth when not using it, so that hackers cannot connect and access personal information. They should take extra care when pairing with anything via Bluetooth and encourage your child to ask a parent or teacher if in doubt.
Connect carefully. When connecting to Wi-Fi networks, kids should make sure they are secure. Public and unsecured private Wi-Fi networks can be a perfect opportunity for hackers to access a mobile device.
Ask for help. If anything that makes your child uncomfortable or confused pops up on their phone, they should talk to a trusted adult or a teacher right away for advice on what to do
The modern features and remarkable convenience of mobile phones have made them indispensable to lifestyles today. It is therefore imperative to educate your child on how to use phones appropriately and safely. Kids are typically on the move all day and hackers looking for victims can quickly gain access to their phones and personal information unless the proper precautions are followed at all times. A phone is a privilege. It should be treated with respect and used intelligently.

Be sure your child is fully aware of the risks that exist while online if they are not careful, their computers can become an ‘open book’ for cyber criminals.
Knowing how to secure electronic devices and use them safely is the key to keeping young people safe and their personal data out of the wrong hands. Here are seven ways to help them maintain computer security:
1. Install security software. Make sure your child’s computer has anti-virus and anti-spyware protection installed and that it’s set up to scan the computer at least once a week.
2. Never skip an update. Keep browsers, software and operating systems updated. Tell your child to accept all update prompts and turn on automatic updates wherever available. 
3. Give the browser a boost. Your child’s computer likely came with a pre-installed browser, but its default settings may not be fully secure. Make sure that you and your child follow the next two tips for web browser security, whether the browser in use is pre-installed or added after purchase.
4. Customize browser security settings. Whichever browser your child is using, help them choose browser security settings that are as safe as possible without affecting the user experience.
5. Clear the cache and browsing history. Avoid leaving behind a record of login IDs, passwords, banking information or other sensitive data. Show your child how to access and delete their browser history and cache data and stress the importance of logging out of all accounts when shutting down.
6. Watch what you download. When downloading files from the internet, be sure your child uses caution and that they are interacting with a trusted source only. Always use anti-virus software to scan downloaded files before opening and immediately delete anything flagged as dangerous.
7. Use a passphrase or complex password. Even if your child is the only one using a computer, ensure the use of a strong log-in password and that computer access is locked after use. Your child should never write down a password and store it near their computer. 
The internet is a wonderful resource for today’s young students, but maintaining security and protecting personal information at all times is crucial. Be sure your child is aware of the threats that can exist while online and how these best practices will help keep them safe, happy and productive students.

From cyberbullying and online predators to hidden costs and beyond, parents are right to have concerns when it comes to their kids playing video games online. To protect your kids, take the time to discuss which games are appropriate for their age group and set expectations and rules that include time limits. Here are eight tips for safe online gaming.
Don’t use personal usernames (gamertags). Kids should avoid usernames and gamertags that can reveal their identity. Always keep personal information secure and out of sight.
Don’t answer personal questions. When using a text or voice chat, your child should never provide personal details — urge them to always focus on the game.
Never answer private messages from strangers. If your child receives private messages from a stranger seeking information or asking to meet in person, they should not reply but report the incident to an adult immediately. Also, they should avoid the trap of sharing personal information to earn more reward points or reach the next level in a game. Cyber criminals may encourage this in order to steal personal information.
Watch out for links and pop-ups. Warn your child to watch out for messages that contain links offering discounts to online gaming services and pop-ups that offer any kind of reward, as they might be phishing scams.
Pay attention to streaming sites. If anyone in a group is streaming the game, the audio and text could be captured and saved on the streaming platform. Advise your child to always avoid saying or typing any personal information. Check the game system’s settings to help ensure safety and privacy.
Beware of cyberbullies. Kids should not respond to anyone who is being rude or engaging in bullying behavior while playing the game. They should just block them.
Check before downloading. Kids should check with a parent before using a credit card online, and always get permission before downloading games. Remind them to purchase or download games from reputable websites only.
Prevention before playing. Before play begins, kids should consult with a parent to make sure their computer has activated security: a firewall, anti-spyware tools and antivirus software.
Video games are meant to be fun but there can be a darker side to the action. Strive to ensure appropriate cyber security by sharing precautions with your child and encouraging best practices. Time limits are always a good idea to avoid games interfering with schoolwork or other activities. Also, check in from time to time to openly explore with your child who they are playing with and which games they are playing. Safety first — that’s the name of the game.

https://kpmg.com/xx/en/our-insights/ai-and-technology/preparing-kids-to-handle-cyberbullying.html,AI and Technology,Preparing kids to handle cyberbullying,,"Cyberbullying affects kids all over the world every day. Bullies used to be a threat in the schoolyard, but they’ve taken their hurtful behavior to the internet and can pop up anywhere, anytime — making them much harder to identify and avoid. Cyberbullying is an unfortunate reality in today’s hyperconnected world and it’s crucial that parents educate children on how to recognize cyberbullies and respond effectively.

What is cyberbullying?

Cyberbullying is a form of bullying using electronic communication — email, texts, social media and more — and has become an increasingly common internet threat. Though similar to regular bullying, cyberbullying takes the trauma one step further by allowing aggressors to follow the victim wherever they go. Virtually anyone, anywhere, anytime can bully another person by simply jumping on the internet or using a cell phone — making cyberbullies harder to escape or identify.
It’s crucial to talk openly to children about cyberbullying. Communicate what they need to watch out for and how best to handle cyberbullying if they become a target — or if they witness someone else being cyberbullied. Here are some useful guidelines to help manage cyberbullying:
Don’t respond. If someone bullies your child, remember that a reaction is what they want. Don’t empower bullies — your child should never engage with them.
Block and don’t share. Your child should block anyone sending hurtful messages. Screen all calls and texts and, if necessary, temporarily suspend social media accounts. Never share hurtful messages that are passed on by others.
Record everything. Tell your child to take screenshots, save hurtful messages and show them to a trusted adult who can help them.
Be an upstander. Not a bystander. This might mean standing up for others who are being bullied, saying something to the bully or those involved, and reporting incidents to a trusted adult. Speak up to show that you care and want to help.
Don’t participate. Never take part in bullying others. Children need to be careful about what they say, share, post or blog about others — unintentional bullying is still bullying! Reading or sharing mean messages empowers bullies and hurts victims even more. It could also get your child in trouble at school or with the police.
Privacy is prevention. Make sure your child’s online presence is as private as possible. Check accounts and make sure privacy settings are correctly enabled at all times.
Report abuse. Most service providers have rules posted on cyberbullying. Work with your child to report any incidents. You can find information on how to report abuse on the community guidelines of most sites.
Talk about it. Encourage your child to discuss with you or a trustworthy friend what they might be experiencing. Others might have gone through a similar experience and be able to provide helpful advice. Don’t let children suffer in silence.

Take action to combat bullies

It´s important that parents and children respond without delay when cyberbullying occurs. As noted, children should always speak up and inform parents or a teacher if they are targeted or if they witness others being bullied. Take these steps as quickly as possible to address the problem:
Never reply to hurtful messages, but do not ignore or simply delete them.
Save bullying texts, posts and emails as a record of what is happening.
Report the ID online and block the cyberbully from any further interaction.
Escalate the issue to your child’s school or to the police if necessary.

Recognize the signs of trouble

Parents should always be vigilant — watching out for signs of a child being cyberbullied. Their behavior in the wake of hurtful messages or interactions can be revealing, so keep your eyes open to the following:
Showing unexpected anger, depression or frustration after using any device — or suddenly avoiding devices all together.
Uneasiness about going to school or participating in group or team activities.
Abnormally withdrawing from friends and family members.
Cyberbullying is a real and pervasive problem in today’s connected world, and it can harm a young person's feelings, self–esteem, reputation and mental health. That makes it crucial for parents and young people to do all they can to recognize and respond quickly to all hurtful behavior. Stay aware of what your child is doing and experiencing online and maintain close regular communication with them to identify and combat cyberbullying.

A similar program was introduced in Brazil in 2016 only for assets located abroad.
Additionally, the same legislation provides for the possibility of updating the value of real estate assets by paying a defined tax rate.

WHY THIS MATTERS
(1)  This year, the Brazilian government offers tax residents in the country the opportunity to regularize their tax affairs in respect of outstanding or undeclared/mis-reported/under-reported assets, both in Brazil and abroad.  This should be welcome news considering the absence of criminal prosecution and the application of lower tax rates and penalties.
(2)  Also, the possibility of updating the value of real estate properties by paying a reduced capital gains tax rate could represent a significant decrease in future tax burdens on individuals.

Main Aspects of Law No. 14,973/2024 for IndividualsVoluntary Disclosure of Currency and Tax Assets (“RERCT-Geral”)
The “RERCT-Geral” applies to Brazilians and foreign nationals who are tax resident in Brazil on December 31, 2023 (even if they are not resident in 2024), who have been or are owners of assets and rights on December 31, 2023 or before, and who have not declared those to the tax authorities, or have declared them with some omissions or incorrect data, and plan to voluntarily disclose them.
The procedures and conditions for adherence were determined through Federal Revenue Normative Instruction No. 2,221/2024², which includes:
 submission of the “Dercat – Declaração de Regularização Cambial e Tributária” (Declaration of Exchange and Tax Regularization), via the individual’s Brazilian Federal Revenue online portal (“Portal eCAC”), from September 23, 2024 until December 15, 2024;
payment of the applicable taxes at a fixed rate of 15% (fifteen percent) by December 15, 2024 – for foreign assets, the taxable basis should be calculated considering the official exchange rate for December 31, 2023, from the Central Bank of Brazil;
payment of the 100% (one-hundred percent) penalty on the assessed tax, as per above, by December 15, 2024.
Real Estate Properties Value Update
Law No. 14,973/2024 also allows individuals to update the value of their real estate properties reported in their 2024-2023 Brazil Annual Individual Income Tax Return, by paying a fixed rate of 4% (four percent) on the calculated capital gain, by December 16, 2024.
Individuals electing for this update should file the “Declaração de Opção pela Atualização de Bens Imóveis – Dabim” (Declaration of Option to Update Real Estate Assets), via their Portal eCAC , from September 24, 2024 until December 16, 2024.  Then, the updated value must be reported in their 2025-2024 Brazil Annual Individual Income Tax Return, by May 30, 2025.
The Federal Revenue Normative Instruction No. 2,222/20243 provides for the possibility of updating the following real estate properties:
In Brazil.
Abroad.
That form part of the assets of a controlled entity abroad where the individual has opted for the tax transparency regime.
That are part of the assets of a foreign trust (one established abroad) whose trustee is obliged to declare the assets and rights of the trust in his/her tax return.
The update cannot be made to real estate properties which were not reported in the individual’s 2024-2023 Brazil Individual Income Tax Return (unless the individual was not eligible for one), to properties acquired in 2024, nor to properties sold prior to the date this update election was formally made.
If the updated property is sold before 15 (fifteen) years have passed as from its update, the calculation of the capital gain tax will be adjusted in proportion to the time elapsed since the update.  The percentage starts at 0% (zero percent) for disposals occurring within 36 (thirty six) months and gradually increases to 100% (one-hundred percent) after 180 (one-hundred eighty) months.

KPMG INSIGHTS
Concerned taxpayers may wish to consult with their qualified tax professional (1) to determine whether their undeclared or under-reported resources/assets/rights are “captured” by the new rules and the next steps they should take and (2) to determine whether their real estate property qualifies for the new updating policy.

https://kpmg.com/xx/en/our-insights/gms-flash-alert/flash-alert-2024-191.html,,,,"The Executive Governor of Lagos State has issued an Executive Order (“the Order”), with immediate effect, for the compulsory subscription to Social Health Insurance by all residents, employers, and workers in Lagos State (“the State”).1  The Order has been issued in line with the objectives of the Lagos State Health Scheme (LSHS), which seeks to promote universal health coverage in the State, guaranteeing residents of Lagos State access to quality health-care services, irrespective of their socio-economic status.
For the complete report and analysis, see ""Lagos State Government Issues Executive Order for the Subscription to Health Insurance Scheme by All Residents and Workers in Lagos State"" (Issue No. 8.1, August 2024), a publication of the KPMG International member firm in Nigeria.

WHY THIS MATTERS
All residents and workers in Lagos State are required to procure their social health insurance from LASHMA, the Lagos State Health Management Agency, or National Health Insurance Authority-accredited health insurance providers that are registered with the Lagos State government.  Residents and workers in the state who did not possess a valid social health insurance plan are required to register or renew their expired plans to access any public or private health-care facility in the State.
The new health-care insurance mandate in Lagos State will affect the take-home pay of individuals covered by the new rules – including globally-mobile employees – who will now have to pay the premiums.  Employers that will also be covered by the new rules, will see their costs increase, as they will also have a premium obligation.
Assignment cost projections and budgeting may need to be reviewed in light of the new rules.

More Details
Based on the Order, all residents, employers, and workers are required to subscribe to a Social Health Insurance Scheme (SHIS) either through the Lagos State Health Management Agency (LASHMA) or a private health insurance provider accredited by both the National Health Insurance Authority (NHIA) and the Lagos State Government (LASG).
The Order is backed by the NHIA Act, 2022 (“the Act”), which mandates every state in Nigeria, including the Federal Capital Territory, to establish and implement a State Health Insurance and Contributory Scheme to provide health care for all residents.  The Act also stipulates that every Nigerian resident must obtain health insurance.  Under the Act, the term “residents” includes all employers (with five or more staff) and employees in the public and private sectors, informal sector employees, and all other residents of Nigeria.
Registration
Registration can be completed by subscribing to a plan via the LASHMA website or through any Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) accredited by the NHIA and LASG.
Paragraph 35 (1) of the Lagos State Health Scheme Law 2015 provides that, as a resident of Lagos State, obtaining the Lagos State Residence Registration Agency (LASSRA) registration number is a prerequisite to enrolling for a health insurance plan.
What the Insured Individual Can Expect
The Order provides that health-care facilities in the State must provide emergency treatment for life-threatening cases without requesting evidence of the enrollment in a health insurance plan; however, once the patient's condition is stabilised, the patient must provide proof of registration for a social health insurance plan or register for one through any of the recommended health insurance agencies before receiving further medical care.
Roles and Responsibilities of Government
To foster compliance, all ministries, departments, and agencies (“MDAs”) in the State are required to make sure that all Lagos State residents and workers who seek to use their facilities or services, have subscribed to the SHIS through the prescribed health insurance providers.  The MDAs must obtain proof of social health insurance registration before granting desiring individuals access to their services in the State.  In addition, the LASHMA will implement public awareness campaigns to educate the public on the significance and mandatory nature of the newly-introduced policy.
The Order also highlights the LASG's commitment to the release of equity funds for the benefit of the State’s vulnerable citizens who cannot afford to procure a health insurance policy.  Anyone in this category will be profiled by an appropriate officer in the public health-care facility and referred to the LASHMA for enrollment in the Equity Fund.

KPMG INSIGHTS
The Executive Order is a positive step towards fostering access to quality health-care services for residents and workers in the State, regardless of their socio-economic status.  This aligns with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG3), which is to “ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all and all ages.”
The Act provides that participation in the state health scheme is mandatory; consequently, private health insurance becomes supplementary.  However, the Lagos State government seems to have heeded the concerns expressed by the public and made it optional for residents to purchase their social health insurance through LASHMA or any of the NHIA-accredited private insurance service providers.  The only condition is that such health providers must register with Lagos State.  Consequently, individuals with health insurance with HMO's can stick with their existing private health providers.
The LASHMA health insurance scheme is tagged “Ilera Eko” and has different plans, such as the Standard Plan, Senior Plan, Diaspora Plan, and Telemedicine Plan.2  Registration for the Lagos State SHIS can be completed via the dedicated website.
Employers should review their current systems and processes and make sure they are making any necessary adjustments in a timely manner, so as to be compliant with the new rules.  It may also be appropriate to develop and issue clear communications to employees regarding any changes that will affect them in light of the new requirements and how their pay-slips will be affected.
All relevant stakeholders are advised to seek professional guidance on the implications of this Order.  Questions and requests for assistance may be directed to a qualified professional services provider or the team with KPMG in Nigeria (see the Contacts section).

https://kpmg.com/xx/en/our-insights/gms-flash-alert/flash-alert-2024-190.html,,,,"An extension until 31 October 2024 was announced in July for the submission of the personal tax declaration, TD1, and payment of the tax due for the 2023 tax year.  The announcement came from Cyprus’ Council of Ministers via a Decree.1  
Based on a Decree issued by the Council of Ministers in 20232, employees, pensioners, and self-employed individuals (except self-employed with accounts3) have an obligation to file a personal tax declaration (TD1) for the tax year 2023 if their annual gross income for the relevant tax year exceeds the tax-free threshold of €19,500.
As per Cyprus’ tax legislation, the filing deadline of the annual tax declaration is typically 31 July of the year following the year of assessment.  Also, taxpayers are required to pay any taxes due as per the self assessment computation of the tax declaration by the same deadline (31 July of the year following the year of assessment).
Based on the above, the initial personal tax return filing and payment deadline in Cyprus for the 2023 tax year, as per the relevant legislation, was supposed to be 31 July 2024.
However, as noted above, in July, Cyprus’ government extended the deadline to 31 October 2024.

WHY THIS MATTERS
Cyprus taxpayers with a Cyprus tax filing obligation for 2023 (both tax residents and non-tax residents), will now have more time to adhere to their Cyprus tax compliance obligations for the relevant tax year.  By doing so, they will be able to avoid penalties for late submission of TD1, as well as additional charges on taxes due, which are applicable in the case where taxes are not paid within the relevant deadline.
International HR and global mobility programme managers, as well as tax service providers, may wish to communicate this extension granted to those affected employees with a Cyprus filing obligation for the 2023 tax year, and make them aware of the penalties that will be imposed in case of non-compliance.

KPMG INSIGHTS
This three-month extension granted for the TD1 filing and payment of taxes due is a positive development, as taxpayers will now have more time to comply with the relevant filing obligations.
In many cases, mainly in cross-border situations, the information required for the completion of the TD1 could not be made available by the initial deadline of the Cyprus tax declaration, and on that basis, delays were often being observed with the filing of the TD1.
Through this extension granted for the 2023 tax year, it should enable all affected parties to timely collect all necessary documents and organise pertinent information to aid in the submission of their TD1 and therefore foster smoother and timely compliance with their Cyprus tax filing obligations, plus avoid penalties and additional charges that could be levied if non-compliant.
It is not expected that a further extension will be granted for the 2023 tax year; therefore, affected parties should make sure that the deadline of 31 October 2024 is respected. 
If any further clarifications are required, please contact your usual tax professional or a member of the GMS tax team with KPMG in Cyprus (see the Contacts section).

https://kpmg.com/xx/en/our-insights/gms-flash-alert/flash-alert-2024-189.html,,,,"With Disposition 388/2024,1 Argentina’s government, on 5 September 2024, announced that as of 23 September 2024, Venezuelans living outside Argentina are allowed to enter the country without a valid passport or Venezuelan ID.  They will also be able to apply for the temporary Mercosur residence2 without the apostille on their documents (i.e., police clearance and birth certificate).

WHY THIS MATTERS
The aim of the regime is to offer a “path” whereby those Venezuelan nationals who live in Argentina and do not meet the requirements to apply for their temporary Mercosur residence can regularize their situations.  Furthermore, it may offer relief to Venezuelans living outside Argentina who may be considering entering Argentina, but uncertain about (1) whether they will face complications at the border or upon entry into tthe country and (2) their chances in respect of applying for the temporary Mercosur residence.

Details
This special regime shall be extended for ninety (90) calendar days as of 23 September 2024, and can be extended if deemed appropriate by the National Immigration office (Dirección Nacional de Migraciones).
Foreign Nationals in Argentina
To initiate the process of filing in the country, the interested party:
Must obtain an appointment before the National Immigration office.
In cases of having an initiated and pending resolution application, may submit a note stating he/ she wants to be included in the regime.
Must have a valid passport or Venezuelan ID.  If the individual cannot meet this request, the National Immigration office will accept expired passports or Venezuelan IDs for a period not exceeding ten (10) years counted at the time of the presentation made by the individual before the National Immigration office.  In the case of children under eighteen (18) years of age, birth certificates will be accepted.
Must have Argentinean Police Clearance.
Must have Venezuelan Police Clearance.
Must prove domicile within the jurisdiction of the National Immigation office where the individual’s residence will be initiated.
Must show proof of payment of the filing fee.
Foreign Nationals outside Argentina
To initiate the process of filing in the country, the interested party must:
Obtain an appointment before the National Immigration office.
Present an expired passport or Venezuelan ID for a period not exceeding ten (10) years counted at the time of the presentation the individual makes before the National Immigration office.  In the case of children under nine (9) years of age, who enter with one of their parents, his/her original birth certificate or legalized copy, will be accepted.
Have Argentinean Police Clearance.
Have Venezuelan Police Clearance.
Prove domicile within the jurisdiction of the National Immigation office where the individual’s residence will be initiated.
Show proof of payment of the filing fee.

KPMG INSIGHTS
Questions about the regime, who it applies to, the conditions for availing of it, and what next steps are advisable should be addressed to a qualified immigration professional or a member of the GMS team with KPMG in Argentina (see the Contacts section).

https://kpmg.com/xx/en/our-insights/gms-flash-alert/flash-alert-2024-174.html,,,,"The Expatriate Service Division (“ESD”) of the Immigration Department of Malaysia has issued an updated announcement on the full deployment of online applications as well as improvements to processes to handle more applications.  (For related coverage, see GMS Flash Alert 2024-165, 7 August 2024.)

WHY THIS MATTERS

Application processes and timelines will be impacted by these changes, in many cases, making things simpler and more convenient.
However, as the process is new and with digitalisation, delays or setbacks may be expected at the early stages of deployment.

Highlights

Simplified application process for the Professional Visit Pass with a reduction in the required documentation.1
Full deployment of online applications by the ESD with effect from 15 August 2024, where manual applications will no longer be accepted over the counter.2
A company’s ESD account activation and admendment of the Letter of Undertaking (“LOU”) to update details of the authorised personnel to liaise with the ESD on behalf of the company, has been made available online effective from 20 August 2024.3

More details

The simplified process for the Professional Visit Pass means a reduction by up to seven (7) documents previously required for the application.  The following documents are no longer required for submission:
Offer letter from the receiving company in Malaysia;
Acceptance letter from the employer in home country;
Job description of the assignment;
Work schedule during the assignment in Malaysia;
Applicant’s academic certificate and resume;
Bank guarantee (for Chinese and Bangladeshi nationals).
  The online applications which were partially deployed are now fully deployed.  The following applications are to be applied online via the ESD’s online system:
Amendment / cancellation of an approved application;  
Transfer of Pass endorsement to a new passport including take-up of the balance of the approved period of the Pass;
Shortening / cancellation of the Pass;
Permission to study for children of expatriates; and
Permission to work at a second location / branch / site office.
The implementation of the online process for a company’s ESD account activation, after the company is successfully registered with the ESD, will eliminate the requirement for the company’s director to visit the ESD’s office in person to sign the LOU.  Subsequent amendments to the LOU will also be submitted online via the ESD’s system.

KPMG INSIGHTS

The improvements and enhancements around digitalisation are expected to give companies a greater degree of flexibility with respect to:
making applications at their fingertips 24/7,
reducing limitations affecting working hours (which should cement Malaysia’s reputation as a business-friendly country).
This is expected to have a positive effect on economic growth. 
There may be a ‘flip side’ to all this, however.  While the number of documents may seem to be reduced, in actual practice, all the details and information must still be provided in the template letter or filled in the online form in the ESD’s system.  
Nevertheless, the changes are still welcome because, as noted, they are expected to reduce the time it takes to prepare all the necessary documentation and travel to the ESD’s office for manual submission.
Companies must make sure that all conditions and requirements are complied with, such as maintaining updates to the company’s details in the ESD’s online system, renewing in a timely manner relevant business required licenses, obtaining prior approvals from the Department of Labour, just to name a few, so that they are compliant with all the relevant regulations.

Talent is a key concern as banking CEOs attempt to attract and retain the professionals with the right skills to support technology-enabled business transformation. ESG is viewed as an important driver of growth that will continue to shape the banks’ behaviors and investments.
The KPMG 2024 Banking CEO Outlook examines how banking CEOs plan to navigate this dynamic environment, adapt their business strategies, and drive success over the next three years.

Banking leaders are balancing the pursuit of prudent growth strategies, deliberating future-oriented investments in technology, talent and ESG.

Key findings from our research

Methodology

The KPMG 2024 Banking CEO Outlook, part of the 10th edition of the KPMG 2024 KPMG CEO Outlook, is compiled from the views of 120 banking and capital markets chief executive officers, which was conducted between 25 July and 29 August 2024, providing unique insight into the mindset, strategies and planning tactics of CEOs.  
All respondents oversee companies with annual revenues over US$500M, and a third of the companies surveyed have more than US$10B in annual revenue. The survey included CEOs from 11 key markets (Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Spain, UK, and US) and 11 key industry sectors, including banking and capital markets.
In the banking sector research, the two largest sub-sectors were commercial banking (27 percent) and capital markets/investment banking (22 percent). The best-represented countries based on organizational headquarters are the US, followed by India, the UK, China, Canada and Germany.

The new Digital Nomad Visa is intended for certain foreign nationals who are seeking to work remotely from Türkiye for companies located abroad.
Recently, the Turkish authorities have begun accepting residence permit applications from eligible remote workers, thereby providing them with an opportunity to extend their stay in Türkiye.

WHY THIS MATTERS
With the newly-implemented Digital Nomad Visa, remote workers can apply from their home or residing countries to Turkish foreign missions without having to enter the country as a first step, like it was required for the short-term residence permit.
The introduction of a digital nomad visa is a nod to the growing importance of new work patterns – which are anticipated to continue for the foreseeable future – and the evolving needs of employers and employees in this “work from anywhere” world.
The Digital Nomad Visa will provide more flexibility for foreign nationals who are working remotely – or wish to work remotely – in Türkiye.
This new visa option has opened the door for individuals who want to experience life in Türkiye while working remotely in the country.

Context

European Commission: New Commissioner-designate for Taxation

European Commission – Commissioners-designate

On September 17, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who was elected for a second mandate on July 18, 2024, presented
opens in a new tab
her proposal for a new College of Commissioners for the next five years.
Under the new proposed allocation of portfolios, the Commissioner for Climate, Net Zero and Clean Growth will be responsible for Taxation, whereas the responsibility for initiatives on reducing administrative and reporting burdens in the EU will fall with the Commissioner for Economy and Productivity, Implementation and Simplification.
Proposed Commissioners are subject to confirmation by the European Parliament.

Background

On July 18, 2024, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen was elected by the European Parliament for a second mandate (2024 - 2029). Subsequently, the Council, in agreement with the President-elect, adopted a list of candidate Commissioners (one for each Member State), with each of the Commissioners-designate receiving a mission letter detailing their responsibilities within the new Commission for the next five years.
The list of candidates and their portfolios was presented to Parliament by the President-elect on September 17, 2024.

Impact on taxation

The core priorities of the new Commission are built around three pillars: prosperity, security, democracy, all underlined by an overarching commitment to competitiveness. These priorities translate into a new structure of the European Commission and a re-design of roles. There will be six Executive Vice-Presidents in charge of a portfolio on which they will be expected to work together with other Commissioners. The new EC will, however, not include Vice-Presidents, as was the case in previous mandates.  
Under the new allocation of attributions, Valdis Dombrovskis
opens in a new tab
(a Latvian national and previously Executive Vice-President of the EC for an Economy that Works for People and Commissioner for Trade) will have a double role as the Commissioner for Economy and Productivity, as well as for Implementation and Simplification. As part of his responsibilities in this role, Mr. Dombrovskis will be charged with ensuring that European rules and policies, which are in place to support business and protect people, are designed in the simplest, fastest and most practical way. In that regard, he will be expected to make proposals that reduce administrative and reporting burdens, in dialogue with all stakeholders and the EU institutions.
In a significant change compared to previous mandates, taxation will no longer be part of the Economy portfolio but will be the responsibility of the new Commissioner for Climate, Net Zero and Clean Growth. Wopke Hoekstra – (a Dutch national and the Commissioner-designate for the Climate portfolio), will work on implementation and adaptation, climate diplomacy and decarbonization, as well as taxation. As part of the mandate given to him with regard to taxation, Mr. Hoekstra has been asked to:
lead the work to level the energy taxation playing field and the strategic use of taxation measures to incentivize the uptake of clean technologies. If approved, the Commissioner will be expected to help conclude the negotiations on the revision of the Energy Taxation Directive and to explore how to further green the VAT system;
identify innovative solutions for a coherent tax framework for the EU financial sector;
continue the work on the reform of corporate taxation (including concluding the negotiations on the corporate tax package);
ensure the European Union keeps the highest level of ambition in fighting tax fraud, tax evasion and tax avoidance;
work with the Member States on the implementation of the global agreement on minimum taxation.

Next steps

The Commissioners-designate will now go through the confirmation hearing process, during which each of them must appear before the parliamentary committee(s) with responsibility for their portfolio, which will result in the publication of evaluation letters. The President-elect will then present the College of Commissioners and their program to the European Parliament, which will vote to elect or reject the Commission as a whole by a majority of the votes cast. If approved, the new Commission will be appointed by the European Council.

ETC Comment

Parliamentary hearings are expected to start in the next few weeks, with the new Commission beginning its work towards the end of the year. Parliament could use these hearings to reject certain candidates and adjust specific portfolios, meaning that the new designated Commission is not yet final. Parliament can only accept or reject the Commission in its entirety and not individual Commissioners-designate.
It will be interesting to see if parliamentarians share the vision of the President-elect von der Leyen, who intends to streamline the hierarchy within the Commission, by eliminating the extra layer of Vice-Presidents and reworking the various assignments to Commissioners. Certain assignments include mixed portfolios, which means that in some instances there is no longer a one-to-one alignment of EC portfolios with EP committees. For example, it will be interesting to see how much say the EP’s ECON Committee has in the vetting of Commissioner-designate Hoekstra, who has been given responsibility over taxation but whose hearing will likely be driven by the EP’s Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety (ENVI) – the pairing of EP committees with Commissioner-designates has not yet been announced.
In light of the slight delay in the nomination process, in practice, the new College of Commissioners might take office later than November, meaning that adoption of the work programme might be delayed to beginning of 2025.

https://kpmg.com/xx/en/our-insights/gms-flash-alert/flash-alert-2022-067.html,,,,"To help people fleeing Ukraine, the French authorities, in large part guided by decisions at the European Union (EU) level, have introduced measures/policies aimed at aiding the entry of and establishing the rights of Ukrainian nationals residing in Ukraine who have been displaced on or after 24 February 2022, as a result of the military invasion by Russian armed forces that began on that date.  
(For related coverage, see GMS Flash Alert 2022-045, 4 March 2022.)

Why this matters

The war between Russia and Ukraine has given rise to a significant departure of individuals from Ukraine.  Specific rules have been put in place in the countries of European Union.  The new rules should facilitate the movement and entry of individuals coming from Ukraine into countries of the European Union and their settlement in those countries, if they wish.  In this GMS Flash Alert we cover France’s response.
Immigration counsel, global-mobility professionals, and companies with employees (and their families) relocating as they flee danger in Ukraine, will want to be aware of the rules intended to address displaced persons resulting from the war in Ukraine.

General Measures Influenced by the European Union

Do Ukraine Nationals Need a Visa to Enter France?

Ukrainians with biometric passports do not need a visa to enter the Schengen Area and therefore to enter France.
For Ukrainians wishing to enter France with a biometric passport, they should know that it is not required to apply for a visa to consular authorities.
Ukrainians without a biometric passport can go to a consular post in a country bordering Ukraine (for example Poland, Romania, Hungary, etc.) so that their situation can be assessed to determine how best – and whether – to obtain a visa or a pass to enter France.
Ukrainians with biometric passports are allowed to stay up to 90 days after they enter the Schengen Area.
If their stay in France is extended beyond 90 days, and/or they need accommodation, they can go to the prefecture of the department in which they arrived, to extend their right to stay.  Also, at the prefecture, they can ask for protection if they so wish.
On 4 March 2022, the European Council adopted the entry into force of the European directive 2022/3821 introducing a system of temporary protection in case of a mass influx of displaced persons from Ukraine.  This system is different from the asylum status which is in place in France since it offers  immediate protection with certain rights for all individuals coming from Ukraine and this status is temporary.  (For related coverage, see the following issues of GMS Flash Alert: GMS Flash Alert 2022-045 (4 March 2022) and GMS Flash Alert 2022-064 (18 March 2022).)

Temporary Protection Status

Temporary protection in France is effective from 4 March 2022, and is valid for one year.  It has been notified by an instruction dated 10 March 2022.2   
The conditions for obtaining temporary protection in France:
Ukrainian nationals residing in Ukraine before 24 February 2022;
Ukrainian nationals who, on this date, were on the territory of a member state of the European Union or a partner state and whose permanent residence is in Ukraine;
Non-Ukrainian nationals who benefit from protection (international or equivalent national) granted by the Ukrainian authorities;
Non-Ukrainian individuals with a valid permanent residence permit issued by the Ukrainian authorities who are not able to return to their country of origin in a safe and sustainable manner;
Family member of a person falling under one of the previous cases (family members are: spouse, unmarried minor children, and dependent relatives).
Few situations are listed in the French instruction dated 10 March 2022, indicating that certain persons cannot ask for a temporary protection (for example when the situation of the person is against the public order).
Ukrainian nationals who hold a residence permit in France which will expire soon are invited to present themselves at the préfecture in order to assess their own situations.  Also, non-Ukrainian nationals who can return to their country of origin under safe conditions are not supposed to ask for temporary protection.  Their right to reside in France may be analysed by the French authority.
The rights allowed by temporary protection are:
The issuance of a temporary residence permit on French territory for a period of six months, bearing the mention “beneficiary of temporary protection.”  This authorisation will be renewed during the period of validity of the decision of the Council on Temporary Protection.
The payment of the asylum-seeker's allowance depending on the conditions of resources and family situation;
The authorisation to exercise a professional activity when the work permit is obtained;
The right to access medical care;
Schooling for minor children;
Support for housing.
To ask for temporary protection, the Ukrainian nationals are invited to go to the local prefecture of the department where they live or are staying with the documents in their possession justifying their situation (passport, place of stay) and accompanied by their family members.3   
Note: Regarding a refugee’s health situation, the European Commission indicated that the lack of travel documents or medical documents (certificate of vaccination, COVID-19 test) should not be an obstacle to entering the EU.  Consequently, the general COVID-19 travel restrictions/formalities should not be applicable when entering European countries and France.

https://kpmg.com/xx/en/our-insights/risk-and-regulation/trailblazing-digital-frontiers.html,Risk and Regulation,Trailblazing digital frontiers,,"In a world where digital landscapes shift rapidly, the importance of technology audits has reached an all-time high.
KPMG Internationals latest paper, “Trailblazing digital frontiers”,  explores how technological advancements are reshaping the audit landscape and what organizations should focus on to keep pace with these changes. With emerging risks from artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, cybersecurity, and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) reporting, the internal audit function should evolve to provide strategic value and assurance in a rapidly shifting environment.
One of the most striking findings is that while technology is central to business transformation, only 43% of organizations feel adequately prepared to audit the risks associated with new and advanced technologies. Critical gaps persist in areas like AI and cloud security, where many organizations struggle to fully understand and audit the risks involved. Furthermore, as ESG reporting becomes increasingly important, the report reveals that just 21% of IT internal audit teams are currently engaged in evaluating ESG-related risks.
The report's insights underscore the need for internal audit teams to bolster their capabilities through targeted upskilling, strategic co-sourcing partnerships, and the use of innovative tools like AI and advanced data analytics. However, a mere 4% of organizations are operating at the highest maturity level for technology audits, indicating a substantial gap between the need for oversight and current capabilities.
To address these challenges, the report outlines key strategies for modernizing the technology audit function, positioning it as a driver of both innovation and risk mitigation. 
To learn how your organization can navigate the complexities of technology risk and take the lead in audit innovation, download the paper today.",https://kpmg.com/content/dam/kpmgsites/xx/pdf/2024/09/global-it-ia-outlook-report.pdf.coredownload.inline.pdf

The tax debate has always been and will continue to be a complex arena for discussion and debate.
The program aimed to create a space where key stakeholders, companies, advisors, decision-makers, campaigners, academics and thinkers, investors and the media could come together to understand complex issues, exchange ideas and find improved solutions. After successful testing in the UK, the project expanded globally, welcoming participants from every region. It covers topics such as tax legality, ethics, evasion, avoidance, transparency, and tax competition between countries.
This collection of interviews provides insights from key stakeholders who have played a significant role in our journey over the past decade. This program has been incredibly diverse and has yielded valuable and impactful results. We intentionally sought out a wide range of perspectives, from corporate stakeholders to policymakers, campaigners, academics, and experts at the forefront of emerging issues related to climate and AI. Taxation affects every aspect of our lives, from personal to societal and from global macroeconomics to individual households in rural Africa.
One of the main roles of the program has been as a convener for these important conversations. In doing so, we have directly quoted our interviewees to convey the changes they have witnessed over the last ten years, including the challenges, opportunities, successes and areas of improvement.
Looking ahead, the next decade is likely to bring about a new set of challenges and opportunities. Despite the potential difficulties, we are optimistic that the journey ahead will be equally enlightening and rewarding. Our commitment to fostering these conversations remains unwavering as we embark on this next chapter.

But key challenges continue to create roadblocks to achieving that growth.
The CEOs in our survey noted concerns related to talent shortages, technology adoption and climate risk. They say they are worried about the risks of generative AI and missing their Net Zero targets. They talk of shifting stakeholder expectations and complex technology environments.
Yet they also show encouraging ambition and action. They are intent on investing into expanding their AI capabilities and skills. They are prioritizing their workforce and developing their talent. Perhaps most importantly, they are more focused than ever on building public trust.

Key findings from our research

Methodology

The KPMG 2024 Infrastructure and Transport CEO Outlook, part of the 10th edition of the KPMG 2024 CEO Outlook, is compiled from the views of 120 infrastructure and transportation chief executive officers, which was conducted between 25 July and 29 August 2024, providing unique insight into the mindset, strategies, and planning tactics of CEOs.
All respondents oversee companies with annual revenues over US$500M and a third of the companies surveyed have more than US$10B in annual revenue. The survey included CEOs from 11 key markets (Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Spain, UK and US) and 11 key industry sectors, including infrastructure and transportation.
NOTE: some figures may not add up to 100 percent due to rounding.
In the infrastructure and transport research, the two largest sub-sectors were mobility and transportation with 50 percent of respondents and rail with 12 percent. The best-represented countries based on organizational headquarters are the US, India, followed by China, Canada, France, Italy and Spain.

https://kpmg.com/xx/en/our-insights/gms-flash-alert/flash-alert-2024-187.html,,,,"A new normative resolution has been introduced to streamline the process for graduates and post-graduates seeking work-based residence in Brazil.1, 2  This resolution aims to make it easier for individuals who have completed their undergraduate or post-graduate studies to obtain residency to work in Brazil.
The resolution will be effective from October 5, 2024.

WHY THIS MATTERS
The new normative resolution enables Brazilian entities to request residence in Brazil based on the immigrant´s graduation or post-graduation, if the course was taken at a Brazilian institution accredited by the Ministério da Educação e Cultura or “MEC” (Brazilian Ministry of Education).
This alternative method of requesting this type of work residence makes the approval process easier and more convenient, as no work experience is needed.  This type of residence can only be obtained within Brazil, and no visa issuances are allowed under this work residence category.

More Details
Some important key points for this kind of residence are:
The applicant must be physically present in Brazil.
The undergraduate or post-graduate degree must have been obtained from a Brazilian institution accredited by the MEC.
This new residence authorization does not apply to immigrants participating in the federal government's Undergraduate Student Exchange Program (PEC) or the University of International Integration of the Afro-Brazilian Lusophony (UNILAB), except after fulfilling the program's obligations in their country of origin.

KPMG INSIGHTS
The new Normative Resolution 50/2024 allows immigrants who have completed their undergraduate or postgraduate degree in Brazil to apply for authorization of residence for work purposes, regardless of the mode of course delivery,3 if the evaluation process and the majority of the academic period were conducted in a Brazilian-accredited institution.
This is different from the current legislation, which requires two years of work experience after completing higher education before applying for authorization of residence for work purposes with an employment relationship in Brazil.  The aim of this change is to encourage foreign students to stay in the country after completing their studies.
The KPMG mobility team is actively monitoring updates on visa rules and related matters and will endeavor to keep readers of GMS Flash Alert informed of any relevant developments.

https://kpmg.com/xx/en/our-insights/gms-flash-alert/flash-alert-2024-186.html,,,,"On September 19, 2024, Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) announced additional restrictions affecting several temporary residency programs, including those for international students and temporary foreign workers.1  These changes include a further reduction in the intake cap for international students in 2025, updates to the eligibility criteria for a Post-Graduation Work Permit (PGWP), and new restrictions on open work permits for spouses of select international students and foreign workers.

WHY THIS MATTERS
This latest announcement is part of Canada’s broader strategy to manage the growing number of temporary residents, while making sure that foreign nationals and Canadian employers do not abuse the immigration system.
Earlier this year, the Canadian government introduced a “soft cap” on the number of temporary residents it would accept, aiming to reduce the temporary resident population from 6.2 percent to 5 percent by 2027.2 This policy has been driven by concerns over housing affordability and pressure on infrastructure. Furthermore, Canada has been implementing new policies, which tighten the rules for international students and enforce greater compliance obligations among employers, including applying more strigent rules on low-wage Labour Market Impact Assessment applications (LMIAs) to protect Canadian workers.

Upcoming Changes to Canadian Temporary Residence ProgramsChanges to Intake Cap for New Study Permit Applications in 2025
In January 2024, IRCC announced that it will set an intake cap on international student applications for a period of two years.
For 2025, the number of approved study permits for international students will be capped at 437,000, representing a 10 percent decrease from the 2024 limit of 485,000.3  This cap is expected to remain in place for 2026 as well.
Unlike in 2024, the cap for 2025-2026 will now include master’s and doctoral students, with IRCC reserving approximately 12 percent of cap allocations for these students.  Additionally, master’s and doctoral students will now need to submit a Provincial Attestation Letter (PAL) as part of their study permit applications.
Restrictions on Work Permits for Spouses of Master’s Degree Students
In April 2024, IRCC stopped issuing open work permits to spouses of international students, except for those in master’s, doctoral, and select professional degree programs.
However, later this year, Canada will limit open spousal work permit eligibility to spouses of master’s students whose programs are at least 16 months in duration.  IRCC has not yet confirmed if current open spousal work permit holders will be able to apply for extensions under the new rules.
New PGWP Eligibility Requirements
Effective November 1, 2024, international students applying for a Post-Graduation Work Permits (PGWP) will be required to demonstrate a minimum language proficiency in English or French.  Specifically, university graduates will need to demonstrate a Canadian Language Benchmark (CLB) level 7, while college graduates will need to meet CLB 5.  This change may pose challenges for foreign students who are not fluent in English or French.
New Work Permit Restrictions for Spouses of Foreign Workers
Currently, the work permit eligibility for spouses of temporary foreign workers does not include restrictions based on the foreign worker’s role, except for TEER 4 and 5 occupations.4
Later this year, open spousal work permits will only be granted to spouses of foreign nationals hired under the Temporary Foreign Worker Program (TFWP) and International Mobility Program (IMP) in managerial or professional occupations or in sectors with labour shortages.

KPMG INSIGHTSConsiderations for Employers & Foreign Nationals, including Students and Workers
The new cap on international study permits could limit opportunities for students wishing to study in Canada and reduce the pool of candidates available to designated learning institutions.
Spouses of select international students, as well as spouses of foreign workers, particularly those outside of managerial or professional roles or sectors without labour shortages, may need to consider alternative pathways to secure work permits in Canada.
The new measures may make Canada a less attractive destination for foreign nationals seeking temporary employment, with employers needed to rely more heavily on Canadian workers or those already eligible to work in the country.
As Canada’s labour market conditions evolve, the government will continue to review and adjust immigration policies.  The 2025–2027 Immigration Levels Plan, set to be released by November 1, 2024, is expected to reflect these temporary resident reductions, potentially leading to further policy changes and restrictions.
Immigration legislation and practices continue to change frequently.  Individuals who have questions or concerns about the new measures are encouraged to contact their usual immigration counsel or KPMG Law LLP (see the Contacts section) for further guidance.

https://kpmg.com/xx/en/our-insights/gms-flash-alert/flash-alert-2024-185.html,,,,"On September 9, 2024, the U.S. Department of State (DOS) announced that all available visas had been issued in the Employment-Based Second Preference (EB-2) category for fiscal year (FY) 2024, ending on September 30, 2024.1  FY 2025 will commence on October 1, 2024, upon which the annual limit will be reset.

WHY THIS MATTERS
Although the immigrant visa has been reached in the EB-2 category for FY2024, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) will continue to accept adjustment of status applications that are current, per the DOS Visa Bulletin, until October 1, 2024.  While such applications will be accepted by USCIS, the applications will not be adjudicated nor approved until FY 2025 begins.  The EB-2 category joins the EB-1, EB-3, EB-4, EB-5 unreserved, and EW immigrant visa categories as those that reached their annual limits in FY2024.  Fortunately, as the new fiscal year is merely days away, applicants will not have to wait an excessive amount of time before the government will resume adjudication of the applications.

Authority to Issue Immigrant Visas
The EB-2 immigrant visa category is for professionals holding advance degrees or individuals of exceptional ability in the sciences, arts, or business.2  The category is given 28.6 percent of the worldwide immigrant visa limit each year, per the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA).3  The DOS has the authority to issue immigrant visas, and USCIS (under the Department of Homeland Security) has the authority to adjudicate applications for permanent residency (Form I-485).  Both departments must do so in line with the percentage allocation offered to each immigrant visa category.
Once the annual quota is met, both departments must wait until the new fiscal year begins before they may begin adjudicating applications again.  For USCIS, this means that it may accept filings for those whose priority date is current on the DOS Visa Bulletin, but cannot adjudicate them, until the new fiscal year.

KPMG INSIGHTS
Individuals with interviews for adjustment of status between now and September 30, 2024, should not expect that their adjustment of status application will be approved prior to October 1, 2024.
KPMG Law LLP in Canada will be tracking this matter closely.  We will endeavor to keep readers of GMS Flash Alert informed on any important developments as they occur.

https://kpmg.com/xx/en/our-insights/gms-flash-alert/flash-alert-2024-184.html,,,,"The Flemish,1 Brussels,2 and Walloon3 regions have each implemented new legislation on the employment of non-European Economic Area (EEA) nationals in Belgium.
Based on this new legislation, each region has made changes to its minimum salary requirements for certain categories of workers.

WHY THIS MATTERS
The minimum salary requirements must be met to obtain the appropriate permit (Work or Single Permit) allowing non-European Economic Area (EEA) nationals to be employed in Belgium.
Employers need to monitor whether salary requirements are met and need to budget for increases to help ensure the continued legal employment of their workforce of non-EEA nationals.
Non-compliance with these minimum salary requirements may lead to a finding by the authorities of illegal employment by the employer and consequently can lead to the imposition of administrative and/or penal sanctions on the employer.

New Minimum Salary Thresholds
The below table shows an overview of the updated minimum salary thresholds for the Flemish, Walloon, and Brussels regions.
•   For the Brussels region, the updated minimum salary thresholds will be implemented as from 1 October 2024*.
•   For the Flemish region, the updated minimum salary threshold for the EU Blue Card has been implemented – in effect since 1 May 2024*.

KPMG INSIGHTS
It is important to note that the definition of “qualifying salary to meet the threshold” is different per region.  Each region determines which salary components can be included in the calculation of the minimum salary threshold.  
A noteworthy change is the Brussels region switching to a monthly gross minimum salary as reported in code 1 of DfmA.  DmfA, short for “Déclaration multifunctionele/multifunctionale aangifte,” is the mandatory electronic reporting tool in which employers report salary and working hours to Belgian authorities.4
The Flemish and Walloon regional authorities will continue to review whether the annual salary amount meets the threshold.
It may be advisable to consult with your usual qualified immigration counsel or a member of the Immigration team with KPMG in Belgium (see the Contacts section).

https://kpmg.com/xx/en/our-insights/gms-flash-alert/flash-alert-2024-183.html,,,,"In a letter dated September 12, 2024,1 U.S. President Joe Biden transmitted the text of the U.S.-Romania social security (“totalization”) agreement to Congress.  Unlike treaties, totalization agreements enter into force pursuant to a statutory legislative procedure.2   Upon entry into force, the agreement will become the 31st such bilateral social security agreement that the United States has concluded.

WHY THIS MATTERS
The U.S.-Romania totalization agreement, like all U.S. agreements, has provisions intended to coordinate social security taxation and benefits for employers and employees where a person is required to work or reside in both two countries at some point during his or her working career.  When it becomes effective, the agreement will help to assure that workers moving between the two countries are not subject to double social security tax.  It also contains provisions that gives the right to partial benefits in both countries to workers who might not otherwise qualify, and removes restrictions that would normally apply to payment of U.S. social security benefits to Romanian nationals living abroad.3  This could positively affect an employee’s decision whether to take an assignment to Romania or the United States. 
Moreover, the agreement serves to simplify the administration of assignments from Romania to the United States and vice versa, thereby making it easier for international companies to deploy their employees to the other country.

More DetailsProcess for Approval and Entry into Force
Negotiators from the U.S. Social Security Administration (SSA) held several rounds of talks with officials from the Romanian Ministry of Labor and Social Protection and the Romanian National House of Public Pensions, with the final agreement text being signed on March 23, 2023.  (For prior coverage, see GMS Flash Alert 2023-068, March 30, 2023.)  The Romanian Parliament ratified the agreement on January 3, 2024.  
The approval process in the United States requires the president to forward the text of the agreement to Congress, accompanied by an analysis of the effects of the agreement.  That having now happened, the agreement will be considered approved if, after 60 days in session, neither house of Congress has passed a resolution of disapproval.  The agreement may then enter into force on the first day of the fourth month following a mutual exchange of diplomatic notes.
What It Provides For
The agreement contains rules broadly similar to many other totalization agreements.  It provides for social security coverage under the laws of the country in which work is performed, subject to several exceptions.  These exceptions include temporary transfers of employment or self-employment activity and special rules for various types of employment, including airline workers, seafarers, and government employees.  Additionally, workers who have earned at least six U.S. quarters of coverage, but not enough to become entitled to a benefit, may combine coverage for purposes of entitlement.
Advantages of the Agreement Quantified
SSA’s Office of the Chief Actuary estimates4 that after the agreement has been in force for seven fiscal years, it will result in employers and their employees saving approximately $88 million in dual social security tax and contributions.  It will also result in around 2,300 people receiving $22 million in annual benefits payments for which they would not otherwise be eligible absent the agreement.

KPMG INSIGHTS
The agreement has been in the works for many years, and this represents an important milestone in its approval.  While the ultimate entry-into-force date depends largely on how frequently Congress is in session during the ongoing presidential election cycle, we do not anticipate any congressional objection to the agreement.  
Barring any unforeseen delays, it will likely enter into force in the first half of 2025, and will be the first such new agreement since 2019, when agreements with Slovenia and Iceland became effective.

Highlights

– What areas do the proposals address?
– What new disclosures would be required?
– Have your say – the comment deadline is 20 January 2025*

A company is generally required to account for investments in associates and joint ventures under the equity method1. To address longstanding application questions on equity accounting under IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) is proposing to amend the standard. 
The exposure draft
opens in a new tab
covers a number of different areas, including when an investor:  
obtains significant influence or joint control over an existing investee (that was not previously accounted for under the equity method);
has transactions with an equity-accounted investee; and
has an interest in an associate or joint venture that is reduced to zero.
The IASB also proposes to reorder the existing requirements in IAS 28.

What areas do the proposals address?

The proposals address the following areas. 
Area Key proposals
An existing investment becomes an equity-accounted investee An investor would determine the initial cost of the investment in an associate or joint venture at the fair value of the consideration transferred, including the fair value of the previously held interest.
An investor’s interest changes but the investee continues to be accounted for under the equity method
An investor purchases an additional interest
Any difference between the consideration transferred for the additional interest and the investor’s additional share of the fair value of the investee’s assets and liabilities would be recognised as goodwill (included as part of the carrying amount of the investee) or as a gain on a bargain purchase in profit or loss. The existing investment would not be remeasured.
An investor disposes of a portion of its interest
A gain or loss would be recognised in profit or loss. This would be measured as the difference between any consideration received and the carrying amount of the interest disposed of. 
Other changes in an investor’s ownership interest 
The accounting for other changes would be consistent with either purchasing or disposing of an interest (as set out above). 
An example of such a change would be an issuance of shares, with the accounting depending on whether the issuance has increased the investor’s stake or diluted it.
An investor has reduced its interest to zero due to losses
An investor would not recognise (‘catch up’) unrecognised losses when purchasing an additional interest. 
In addition, an investor would recognise separately its share of the investee’s profit or loss and its share of the investee’s other comprehensive income.
Transactions with equity-accounted investees
An investor would recognise in full the gains and losses from all ‘upstream’ and ‘downstream’ transactions with its associates and joint ventures, including transactions involving loss of control of a subsidiary, in profit or loss.  
This proposal would replace the current IAS 28 requirement that limits the recognition of gains and losses from such transactions.
Deferred tax on initial recognition of an investee An investor would include a deferred tax asset or liability in the investment’s carrying amount, based on its share of the associate or joint venture’s identifiable net assets and liabilities at fair value.
Contingent consideration An investor would measure contingent consideration at fair value. Classification and subsequent measurement would also be consistent with the existing requirements in IFRS 3 Business Combinations. 
Impairment A decline in fair value would be assessed in relation to the carrying amount of the investment rather than the original cost.
 These proposals would apply prospectively, except for the recognition of gains and losses on transactions with equity-accounted investees, which would be applied retrospectively. 
Contingent consideration would be recognised and measured at fair value at the date of transition.

What new disclosures would be required?

The proposals would introduce several new disclosure requirements, including the following:
A reconciliation of the carrying amount of equity-accounted investments – detailing the share of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, distributions, impairment losses and ownership changes. 
Gains or losses from other ownership changes and downstream transactions. 
Information on any contingent consideration arrangements.

Have your say

The IASB has requested comments by 20 January 2025. Take this opportunity to read and comment on the proposals.
For further information on the proposals, speak to your KPMG contact.

KPMG was at the center of the action, hosting a number of events with the goal of helping businesses better understand their nature- and climate-related risks and learn about cutting-edge sustainable practices and technologies that can increase environmental efficiency.
Every business has a part to play in reversing the catastrophic impacts of climate change, and we want to help with this critical endeavor in any way we can.

Accelerating the energy transition is the most critical step in helping to decarbonize the global economy, and as energy demand continues to rise, the transition to clean energy solutions remains a challenge due to cost, policy and technology maturity issues.

In addition to the above themes, KPMG will also be focused on the below initiatives that can help in navigating the global climate challenge and how to achieve a just energy transition.

At KPMG, we believe much greater attention needs to be paid to the impact the climate crisis will have on global healthcare. According to the World Health Organization, the climate crisis is the single biggest threat to health, resulting in 300,000 deaths annually, and it will affect the most vulnerable in our society. Our perspective is that the impact on health will be at least as great as the financial and physical impacts of climate change. We see two key issues:
1. Health systems must adapt to climate change and become resilient, and;
2. Health systems must reduce their own emissions and contribute to global efforts.

In today’s global marketplace, companies are faced with an almost constant pressure to change and adapt. There are a variety of factors that drive this change including economic and political uncertainty, increasing business complexity and the need to satisfy ongoing demands from stakeholders. 
Creating the right structure to meet current challenges and providing flexibility to address future risks is critical for all companies as they face into an ever shifting regulatory landscape.
Whilst it is relatively easy to conceptualize a transformation project, taking a structuring project from concept to plan, and from plan to implementation can be complex and often contains pitfalls for the unwary.

Areas where we know KPMG firms’ clients are experiencing a need to act are:

https://kpmg.com/xx/en/our-insights/gms-flash-alert/flash-alert-2024-182.html,,,,"In this GMS Flash Alert, we report on the latest updates to the Work and Holiday (Subclass 462) visa.
From 16 September 2024, the Australian government will introduce a new ballot process which will be open to individuals from India, the People’s Republic of China (“China”), and Vietnam.1

WHY THIS MATTERS
This visa lets people 18 to 30 years old have an extended holiday in Australia but also allows them to work in the country to help fund their trip.  This introduces greater flexibility and incentive for such individuals, but also could help employers fill some gaps in hiring where they may be experiencing difficulties filling a position.
Another positive aspect of the announced changes is that now Indian passport holders will be permitted to apply for a Work and Holiday (Subclass 462) visa.  Prior to the introduction of the ballot process, nationals from India were not able to apply for a Work and Holiday visa to Australia.
These changes introduce a ballot process for the high-demand Working and Holiday (Subclass 462) visa countries of India, China, and Vietnam.  One limitation of the introduction of the ballot process is that demand for the Work and Holiday visa from India, China, and Vietnam is anticipated to exceed the availability of these visas under the ballot process.  Currently nationals from China and Vietnam applying for a Work and Holiday visa are not subject to visa allocation caps.

Highlights of the Changes

The Subclass 462 visa allows young adults with an eligible passport to travel to Australia for up to one year and generally work for the same employer for up to six months. 
These changes introduce a ballot process for the high-demand Working and Holiday (Subclass 462) visa countries of India, China, and Vietnam.
The ballot is an electronic random selection process with selected entrants invited to apply for a first Work and Holiday (Subclass 462) visa online.
Individuals must be aged between 18 and 30 years old when they register for the ballot.
Registration costs are expected to be A$25.
There will be separate ballots for India, China, and Vietnam.
Individuals from India will need to evidence completion of two years post-secondary education but do not need to provide evidence of foreign government support.

KPMG INSIGHTS
As earlier noted, the changes allow Indian passport holders to apply for a Work and Holiday (Subclass 462) visa and introduce a ballot process for India, China, and Vietnam.  Previously Indian nationals were not able to lodge Work and Holiday visa applications to Australia.
A ballot aims to provide an equitable, streamlined, and transparent means of selecting applicants, in locations where the number of registrations significantly exceeds the number of places available for a participant country in a program year.
Opening the Work and Holiday (Subclass 462) visa to Indian passport holders is expected to  strengthen the ties between India and Australia as part of the India-Australia Economic Cooperation agreement.

Upcoming Festive Season: Reminder 

As the festive period approaches, it’s important to note that processing times by the Department of Home Affairs may be impacted.  This is due to a combination of factors including the closure of processing offices during public holidays, government staff holidays/absences, and an increase in visa lodgements which typically occurs in the lead-up to the new year.

KPMG INSIGHTS
To avoid delays, KPMG in Australia recommends lodging visa applications as soon as possible.
Please note that KPMG offices in Australia will be closed from 5:00pm Thursday, 19 December 2024, and will re-open on Thursday 9 January 2025.  The Australian immigration team will have “skeleton” staffing during this time (except for public holidays) for immigration emergencies.

https://kpmg.com/xx/en/our-insights/regulatory-insights/fca-strategy-and-business-plan-2022-23.html,Regulatory Insights,FCA’s Strategy and Business Plan 2022/23,,"The FCA has published its 2022/23 business plan
opens in a new tab
 and strategy
opens in a new tab
. The new three-year strategy and annual plan are designed to help firms understand the areas of focus for the regulator, the risks and harms it is concerned about and its upcoming work plan.
Despite it being only nine months since the FCA published its three-year strategy in July 2021, the FCA has fundamentally revisited its approach and the associated business plan.  It has taken a more holistic and outcomes-focused approach than has been seen previously — the strategy and plan feel very different to what has gone before.
However, close inspection of the details reveals that they are closer to a repackaging of existing commitments rather than a seismic shift or change of focus. The key step change is the degree of accountability and the granularity of the metrics that the FCA will use to measure its progress. The strategy will now be fixed for the next three years to enable the FCA to assess how well it is performing against its areas of strategic focus.
Within its new strategy, the FCA has set out:
Three areas of focus (reducing and preventing serious harm, setting and testing higher standards and promoting competition and positive change). 
Four consistent topline or overarching outcomes, fair value, confidence, access, and suitability & treatment. The first three apply to both wholesale and retail, whilst the last only applies to retail.
Thirteen commitments which will drive specific regulatory activity over the next three years. The specific activities that the FCA intends to perform this year to deliver these commitments are captured in the Business Plan.
Additionally, the FCA provides an update on its transition to a data-led regulator, its national locations strategy, and its ongoing commitment to improving its diversity and inclusion.

A re-focused and articulated strategy
To illustrate its movement away from being process-focused to results-focused, the FCA has re-articulated its strategy via the outcomes it expects all firms to deliver. The new three-year strategy is intended to drive focus on:
Reducing and preventing serious harm
Setting and testing higher standards
Promoting competition and positive change
Underneath these areas of focus, the FCA has captured what it terms 'consistent topline outcomes'. This are overarching outcomes which cut across all sectors. This approach is designed to enable the FCA to combine its capabilities to address concerns and opportunities efficiently, effectively and consistently.
Finally, the FCA has set out thirteen underpinning commitments detailing activities that it will undertake and how it will measure its impact.

A business plan focused on desired outcomes

The FCA's associated business plan has a stronger alignment to the FCA's strategy than we have seen previously and it flows directly from it. Essentially, the business plan explores each of the commitments setting out (i) the outcomes it wants to achieve, (ii) how it will measure progress and (iii) how it intends to achieve the outcomes.
As previously announced, the FCA has committed to report against the strategic outcomes and metrics that it would set over a multi-year period. This business plan gives details of some of the proposed metrics to measure progress against the FCA commitments for 2022/23.
Focus 1 — Reducing and preventing serious harm

Focus 2 — Setting and testing higher standards

Focus 3 — Promoting competition and positive change

Increased FCA accountability via formal metrics 
The FCA has set out detailed metrics
opens in a new tab
 to measure progress against the `topline outcomes' it is trying to achieve. Where metrics already exist, baseline values are provided. In cases where metrics are not yet available, the FCA has explained its plans for the future. The metrics will be further updated and developed through 2022/23.
The FCA has also reported on the seven strategic transformation-linked outcomes and metrics that formed part of last year's business plan.

FCA assesses its own positive impact

Following on from the accountability theme, the FCA has published: for the first time, a paper designed to set out how it delivers public or societal value. This paper, designed to be a regular (presumably annual) publication, provides quantified estimates of the positive impact of a subset of its activities — specifically its policy interventions and enforcement work. The report includes value for money considerations which reflect the FCA's estimate that it has generated a benefit of at least £6 billion per year over the three-year period. This implies a benefit of at least £11 for every pound spent on running the FCA.

FCA increases in funding requirement

The FCA's annual budget reflects the cost of the resources it needs to carry out its proposed work in 2022/23. The key figure for firms is the Annual Funding Requirement which is the total amount that the FCA charges the financial services industry to fund its activities. The proposed funding requirement for 2022/23 is £640.1m — an increase of 4.3% on 2021/22.
Alongside the strategy and business plan, FCA has also published its annual consultation
opens in a new tab
 on regulatory fees and levies, which provides further information about its funding requirement and the impact on specific firm's activities. Alongside the funding requirement, the FCA is also proposing minor changes to its fees and levies policy including: 
Changes to FCA periodic fees — including the new structure of minimum fees for the `A' fee-blocks and consumer credit firms.
Integrating its new structure of application fees to credit rating agencies and trade repositories (including third country firms seeking certification as either).

https://kpmg.com/xx/en/our-insights/regulatory-insights/consumer-duty-april-2022.html,Regulatory Insights,Consumer Duty,,"The FCA’s expectations for the Consumer Duty are clear and the implementation deadlines have been set.

The Consumer Duty will increase the current level of consumer protection in the retail financial services market. The FCA has signalled a ""paradigm shift in its expectations"" and therefore the impact of the Consumer Duty should not be under-estimated in terms of its regulatory intentions. The FCA is not just repositioning and articulating existing requirements — the initiative represents a “raising of the bar” and a “mind-set shift” with far-reaching implications for the retail sector. The FCA acknowledges that, although some firms may already be meeting some of these expectations, other firms will need to develop significantly to meet them.
The Consumer Duty’s wide application reduces any ‘first mover disadvantage’ that could be a barrier to firms making the appropriate enhancements. It is intended to be deeper than just a firm’s policies and procedures — to go right to the heart of its culture, strategy and business.
The FCA is seeking to drive culture and conduct changes in firms by placing an expectation that a firm’s approach is embedded across the entire customer journey, and within each of its relevant departments. This initiative signals an intended destination of the FCA’s journey to outcomes-based regulation.

The Consumer Duty will be implemented in two phases:
Phase 1    A 12-month implementation period for open products and services giving firms until 31 July 2023 to make the required changes.
Phase 2    A further 12-months for firms to implement and comply with the Duty for closed products or services (i.e. those are no longer being sold or marketed). The Consumer Duty will be fully in force by 31 July 2024.

Key milestones

The implementation period includes milestones for when the FCA expect firms to have finished planning their implementation work, reviewing their existing open products and services, and remedying issues identified to ensure they are fully compliant:
31 October 2022
Consumer Duty implementation plans agreed by the Board
Firms are expected to be able to evidence appropriate scrutiny and challenge by its Board to ensure their plans are deliverable and robust. Firms should expect to be asked to share implementation plans, Board papers and minutes with supervisors and to be challenged on their contents.
Where appropriate assurance of plans cannot be provided by that date, firms will be expected to inform the FCA. 
30 April 2023
Completed open product and service review
Firms need to have fully reviewed all existing products and have shared the outcomes with distributors by the end of April 2022.
In reality, this means firms only have nine months of the twelve-month period to fully complete the work. Assuming firms need all this, it only gives distributors three months to respond, make decision about its distribution strategy and implement any changes to be compliant.

KPMG provides feedback on European Commission evaluation of the Anti-tax Avoidance Directive

European Commission – Anti-tax Avoidance Directive  – Interest Limitation Rules – Exit Taxation Rules – General Anti-Abuse Rules (GAAR) – Controlled Foreign Company (CFC) Rules – Anti-Hybrid Mismatch Rules

On September 11, 2024, KPMG member firms in the EU submitted a response
opens in a new tab
to the European Commission’s call for evidence
opens in a new tab
for the evaluation of the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive.
KPMG welcomes the opportunity to comment on the implementation, functioning and future-proofing of the Directive, as well as on its relevance in the current economic and regulatory environment.
The KPMG submission includes considerations regarding the interaction of ATAD with the EU Minimum Tax Directive and feedback on a number of areas where further clarity and certainty would be welcomed. We also provide comments on the adequacy of the deductibility threshold and de minimis rule and the scope of exclusions for long-term public infrastructure projects.

Background

On July 12, 2016, the Council of the European Union (EU) adopted the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive (ATAD I) Directive (EU) 2016/1164. The Directive is a separate and distinct initiative from the OECD’s Base Erosion Profit Shifting (BEPS) plans; however, the Directive was designed to implement and build on the proposals announced as part of the BEPS initiative in October 2015, in an attempt by the European Union to harmonize the adoption of anti-BEPS measures into local laws across EU Member States.
On May 29, 2017, the Council of the EU adopted a Directive (ATAD II – Council Directive (EU) 2017/952) to amend the hybrid mismatch measures in ATAD I. The Directive extends Article 9 to include hybrid mismatches between EU Member States and third countries and introduces rules on hybrid permanent establishment (PE) mismatches, hybrid transfer, hybrid financial instrument mismatches, dual resident mismatches, reverse hybrid mismatches and imported mismatches.
ATAD I and II therefore contain five specific measures:
Article 4: Interest Limitation Rules
Article 5: Exit Taxation Rules
Article 6: General Anti-Abuse Rules (GAAR)
Articles 7 & 8: Controlled Foreign Company (CFC) Rules
Article 9: Anti-Hybrid Mismatch Rules
In August 2020, in line with the requirements of Article 10 of ATAD, the Commission produced an interim report for the European Parliament and Council (COM(2020) 383 final), providing a preliminary overview of each Member States' implementation of the ATAD measures. This report was a first step in the evaluation process and determined that the Commission would produce a comprehensive evaluation report on the measures in ATAD. 
The ATAD evaluation is expected to provide evidence on the implementation of the Directive, to what extent its objectives have been achieved, and whether the measures need to be amended in the future. According to the European Commission, this offers a unique opportunity for the rules to be updated to better reflect the current environment, to deliver on the EU’s objectives of administrative simplification and to provide more clarity and certainty to taxpayers.

KPMG’s feedback

KPMG member firms in the EU1 were pleased to provide comments on the implementation, functioning and future-proofing of the Directive, as well as its relevance in the current economic and regulatory environment.
The key points highlighted in the KPMG submission can be summarized as follows:
The interaction of ATAD with the EU Minimum Tax Directive creates an additional level of complexity and has created a risk of double taxation, which should be addressed at EU level. In particular, we recommend that ATAD is amended to exempt from CFC regimes those groups that are in scope of Pillar Two.
Based on our practical experience with the application of ATAD, we note a number of areas where further clarity and certainty would be welcomed, such as with regard to the treatment of capitalized interest costs for the purposes of the interest limitation rules, and issues related to group taxation in the context of the anti-hybrid rules.
We also recommend that the adequacy of the deductibility threshold and de minimis rule and the scope of exclusions for long-term public infrastructure projects are revisited to better reflect the current economic environment and international environment.
Each of these points is addressed in further detail in our response, available here
opens in a new tab
.

ETC Comment

Following the conclusion of the feedback period on September 11, 2024, the Commission is expected to adopt its evaluation on ATAD during the third quarter of 2025.
The complexity of ATAD is increased by the differences between Member State regarding its implementation. KPMG’s EU Tax Centre conducted a survey of our member firms in August 2024 to ascertain whether each of the five ATAD measures had been fully transposed by Member States. The survey also sought to understand the approaches taken by Member States when incorporating the ATAD measures into domestic law. A summary of the findings of this survey are included in our EU Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive – Member State Implementation Overview report

Navigating a decade of disruption: Ten years of the KPMG CEO Outlook research shows CEO confidence in their organization’s future, despite geopolitical and economic volatility.

From the race to embrace artificial intelligence (AI) to ever-mounting geopolitical concerns, the challenges faced by the CEOs of today are vast and complex. Alongside these external pressures, internal challenges such as upskilling the workforce and hybrid working are pushing CEOs to be agile and adaptable in their stakeholder management while also keeping an eye on long-term growth.
First launched globally 10 years ago, the KPMG CEO Outlook surveys more than 1,300 global business leaders overseeing companies with revenues of at least US$500M from some of the world’s biggest economies and key industries.
The last 10 years have been defined by volatility, ranging from the economic and social shockwaves of the COVID-19 pandemic to the resurgence of inflation and geopolitical tensions. In the face of this, leaders have had to adapt to an unprecedented array of challenges that have not only placed greater pressure on CEOs’ shoulders but driven a waning of confidence in the global economy.
Yet, global leaders remain resilient, leading their businesses on a path to sustainable growth. Global leaders continue to create a solid foundation by betting big on AI and bolstering their workforce to adapt to evolving business needs. This year’s survey shows that CEOs are optimistic about their organization’s future, with 92 percent of leaders looking to increase the overall headcount of their workforce, but also recognizing they need to future proof the skillsets of their people and demonstrate increased employee value proposition to attract and retain talent. Balancing ambition and appropriate caution will be key when it comes to ESG issues if CEOs want to avoid stakeholder criticism and, more importantly, do the right thing.

Over the past decade, the confidence of CEOs in the global economy has waned, reflecting the growing complexities of the environment they face. While confidence has remained relatively stable over the past three years, with 72 percent of CEOs optimistic about the economy, this marks a significant shift from the robust 93 percent seen in 2015 when the survey first launched.

CEO confidence in the global economy (2015-2024)

The growing complexity and variety of demands of leading a large organization are being felt keenly by CEOs, with almost three quarters (72 percent) confessing they feel under more pressure to ensure the long-term prosperity of their business.
This additional pressure felt by CEOs could be attributed to an evolving list of threats to business growth with this year’s survey showing that CEOs are the most concerned about the impact of supply chain disruption, and operational issues on their business’ growth in the next three years, coming in above cyber security and even last year’s number one threat – geopolitics and political uncertainty.

How 2024’s top threats to growth have evolved over the last ten years

Top risks over the last ten years

Ten years of survey data demonstrates how leaders have sought to create confidence in business growth, from increased investment in innovation and tech, to placing a fresh focus on the employee value proposition and renewing their commitment to ESG and sustainability as a source of value creation. Looking more closely at the next three years, respondents identified their top operational priorities as advancing digitization and connectivity across their business (18 percent), understanding and implementing generative AI across the business and upskilling their workforce (13 percent), and execution of ESG initiatives (13 percent). By futureproofing their business for a digital world and focusing on fostering and retaining great talent, CEOs not only address their immediate operational needs but also position their organizations for sustainable, organic growth.

Technology and generative AI

AI front and center as the urgency around adoption accelerates

For the CEOs surveyed, technological innovation has been the single most disruptive force over the past 10 years, with emerging and disruptive technology landing as a top three risk to growth in six of the past nine surveys.
When KPMG first launched the CEO Outlook a decade ago, AI was gaining traction with breakthroughs in areas such as image recognition, natural language processing and autonomous vehicles. In 2024, the majority (64 percent) of global CEOs indicated that they would invest in AI regardless of economic conditions. And while today’s AI use-cases generate plenty of buzz in the public discourse, global CEOs recognize the need to seize the challenges that lie ahead, considering AI’s potential to transform every aspect of our everyday life.

Workforce upskilling a key piece of the AI puzzle

Despite public concern around the risk of redundancies, CEOs recognize the transformative potential of AI and remain confident that it will not have a detrimental impact on the workforce, with over three quarters (76 percent) of CEOs anticipating AI will not fundamentally reduce the number of jobs within their organizations over the next three years. Yet, CEOs also recognize their workforce will need to adapt to fully harness the opportunity, as when asked about their organization’s current AI readiness, only 38 percent of CEOs were confident that their employees have the right skills to fully leverage the benefits. Furthermore, 58 percent agree that the integration of generative AI has made them rethink the skills required for entry-level roles.

Where CEOs invest will be key

This growing commitment to AI shows that global CEOs are building on the capital expenditure momentum witnessed last year, as all CEOs say they plan to invest in AI in some form. They recognize AI’s potential to increase efficiency and productivity (16 percent), upskill the workforce for future readiness (14 percent) and increase organizational innovation (13 percent). However, a majority of CEOs (63 percent) acknowledge an ROI on AI is unlikely for at least three to five years — in line with last year.

Ethical implementation of AI a concern for most

Amid growing concerns about the ethical use and implementation of AI, CEOs are increasingly aware of the risks tied to its rapid adoption. Well over half (61 percent) identified ethical challenges as some of the most difficult issues to address when implementing AI within their businesses — an increase from 57 percent in 2023. Additionally, concerns over a lack of regulation (50 percent) and insufficient technical skills and capabilities (48 percent) further complicate the path forward.

Talent

CEOs doubling-down on the return-to-office debate

Since 2015, as employees have demanded more flexibility in working patterns and a stronger alignment between personal beliefs and organizational purpose, successful leaders have adapted well to this shifting workforce dynamic. The leaders who prosper are those who put people at the heart of their growth strategy and evolve their social contract to keep up with the evolving expectations of current and future talent.
However, the leaders surveyed show that the return-to-office debate continues to give food for thought. This years’ findings reveal that CEOs are hardening their stance on returning to pre-pandemic ways of working, with 83 percent expecting a full return to the office within the next three years — a notable increase from 64 percent in 2023. And this expectation only increases with age: 75 percent for those aged 40 to 49, 83 percent for those aged 50 to 59, and 87 percent for those aged 60 to 69. Interestingly, there is also a gender split emerging in this debate: while 84 percent of male CEOs predict a full return to the office within three years, only 78 percent of female CEOs anticipate the same shift back. Furthermore, 87 percent of respondents say they are likely to reward employees who make an effort to come into the office with favorable assignments, raises or promotions.

Generational difference on the back to office debate

Overall percentage of CEOs predicting a full return to office over the next three years

CEOs also acknowledge that other talent-related issues could affect future growth and competitiveness. Almost a third of them say they are concerned about labor market shifts — specifically the number of employees that will soon retire, and the lack of skilled workers available to replace them. In response to this talent shortage, 80 percent of CEOs agree that organizations should be investing in skills development and lifelong learning within local communities to help safeguard access to future talent. With this local commitment, 92 percent of leaders hope this will help to increase the overall headcount of their workforce over the next three years.

CEOs three-year outlook on expected headcount growth from 2015 to 2024

This year’s findings expose the reality of navigating environmental, social and governance priorities in today’s climate. Alongside a growing awareness of ESG’s impact on trust and reputation, the increasingly politicized nature of the ESG agenda is heightening the pressure felt by today’s leaders.
In 2015, CEOs ranked environmental risk as their least concerning priority risk; fast-forward to 2024 and almost a quarter (24 percent) acknowledged that the principal downside of failing to meet ESG expectations would be giving their competitors an edge, coming out ahead of threat to their own tenure (21 percent) and recruitment challenges (16 percent).  
It’s clear that leaders are willing to take action when it comes to ESG, with three quarters (76 percent) of CEOs saying they would be willing to divest a profitable part of the business that was damaging their reputation. More tellingly, a majority (68 percent) indicate that they would take a stance on a politically or socially contentious issue, even if the Board raised concerns with them doing so. The survey also shows that today’s CEOs recognize just how vital ESG is to value creation — just under a quarter (24 percent) cite giving their competitors an edge as the principal downside of failing to meet ESG expectations.
Two-thirds of CEOs admit they aren’t prepared to withstand the potential scrutiny and expectations of shareholders when it comes to ESG, suggesting they will take action to mitigate this. Interestingly, there are emerging generational differences among CEOs, with 43 percent of younger leaders (aged between 40 and 49) feeling more confident they can take on scrutiny around ESG compared to 33 percent of CEOs aged 50-59 and 30 percent of those aged 60 to 69.
We’re also seeing a growing level of politicization and polarization of issues such as social mobility and climate change, and it’s creating challenges for CEOs who are already under pressure to meet or reassess established targets. As a result, some global CEOs are shifting how they communicate their ESG efforts. In this year’s survey, 69 percent reveal that while they’ve retained the same climate related strategies over the last 12 months, they’ve adapted the language and terminology they use internally and externally to meet changing stakeholder needs. For example, political and social forces have pushed some businesses to change the language they use, with some organizations preferring to use general terminology such as “sustainability” over the more encompassing term of “ESG.”

CEOs' perspectives on ESG

Finally, 30 percent say the greatest barrier to achieving their climate ambitions is the complexity presented by the decarbonization of their supply chain — an issue further compounded by current geopolitical tensions around the world and activities impacting major global trade routes. As we head into 2025, it will be interesting to see how this impacts opinions and organizations overall, as ESG reporting begins to take hold across the globe.

Sector outlooks

Methodology

About the KPMG 2024 CEO Outlook
The 10th edition of the KPMG CEO Outlook, conducted with 1,325 CEOs between 25 July and 29 August 2024, provides unique insight into the mindset, strategies and planning tactics of CEOs.
All respondents have annual revenues over US$500M and one-third of the companies surveyed have more than US$10B in annual revenue. The survey included leaders from 11 markets (Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States) and 11 key industry sectors (asset management, automotive, banking, consumer and retail, energy, infrastructure, insurance, life sciences, manufacturing, technology and telecommunications).
NOTE: Some figures may not add up to 100 percent due to rounding.",
https://kpmg.com/xx/en/our-insights/regulatory-insights/sustainability-disclosure-requirements-increase.html,Regulatory Insights,Sustainability disclosure requirements increase,,"Environmental, social and governance (ESG) reporting requirements for companies and mandatory disclosures by financial services firms are expanding rapidly. 
Firms need to prepare to make more disclosures and to use the information disclosed by others. They must also be able to substantiate their sustainability claims, at entity- and product-level, to regulators, investors and consumers. Independent assurance requirements are being introduced in some areas.
The 2021 status report
opens in a new tab
 of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) indicates that the TCFD's recommendations are being adopted in an increasing number of jurisdictions and by more companies, with Europe leading the way. But significant progress is still needed, with a worldwide average of only one in three companies reviewed making TCFD-aligned disclosures.  
The proposed EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) heralds a significant expansion in the range of entities required to report and what those disclosures must cover. It adds to the new requirement under the Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD), which was introduced via Article 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation and requires around 11,000 large companies to disclose proportions of turnover and expenses relating to environmentally sustainable activities. CSRD will:
Extend the scope of NFRD to all large companies and all companies listed on regulated markets (except listed micro-enterprises), with future capture of non-listed entities
Require the audit (assurance) of reported information
Introduce more detailed reporting requirements and a requirement to report according to mandatory EU sustainability reporting standards
Require companies to add a digital tag to the reported information, to feed into the European “single access point” envisaged in the Capital Markets Union action plan
The proposed Green Bond Standard is also being debated, but work on criteria for an EU Ecolabel for retail investment products has been put on hold until the Level 2 rules on climate change mitigation and adaptation under the Taxonomy Regulation are completed.
There are more rules to come on product disclosures. The ESAs have submitted to the Commission draft rules for SFDR Article 8 and 9 products to underpin the additional requirements introduced into SFDR via the Taxonomy Regulation. Precontractual and periodic disclosures must identify the environmental objectives to which the product contributes and show how and to what extent the product's investments are Taxonomy-aligned. These will take the form of graphs and changes to the existing SFDR mandatory templates. In addition, independent assurance will be required.
The UK government has issued
opens in a new tab
 “A roadmap to sustainable investing”, which covers phase 1 of the government's three-phase plan for greening the financial system: informing investors and consumers, acting on the information, and shifting financial flows. In addition to work on a UK taxonomy (see ESG taxonomies article), rules to be developed will require financial services firms and real economy corporates to report consistent information on sustainability.
The new regime will streamline existing disclosure requirements (e.g. TCFD-aligned) with new requirements, including on reporting environmental impact. Investment products will need to make consumer-focused disclosures showing the impact, risks and opportunities of the activities they finance. This will be accompanied by a consumer-facing label, to be developed by the FCA. Moreover, asset managers, asset owners and investment products will be required to substantiate their sustainability claims.
Body Text
Making existing rules work
ESMA's 2022 work programme
opens in a new tab
 (PDF 590 KB) says the priority will be to support building new sustainability disclosure rules and to lead common approaches in national regulators' supervisory practices. ESMA notes that extensive work will be required to build consistent application of rules and effective approaches. It will prepare a supervisory briefing to assist national regulators in supervising investment products with sustainability features and will develop further its own sustainability risk identification methodology.
The EBA recognises that the proposed Green Asset Ratio is imprecise in its current iteration but believes it will improve through use and experience. Final Pillar 3 proposals are expected to be approved by end-2021. As part of its 2022 work programme (PDF 1.25 MB), the EBA will monitor the effective implementation of ESG disclosure standards and gradually expand the scope of disclosure reflecting the development of the EU taxonomy and data availability.
In July, the FCA published
opens in a new tab
 guiding principles and key considerations on the design, delivery and disclosure of UK sustainable investment funds. The principles take the form of a “Dear Chair” letter. They are a statement of the FCA's expectations for retail funds that incorporate ESG attributes and include interpretative guidance and examples to help firms.
Body Text
SFDR — a little more clarity, perhaps
In January 2021, with less than eight weeks before the first March 2021 SFDR implementation deadline, the ESAs wrote to the Commission highlighting several important areas of uncertainty in the interpretation of SFDR that needed urgent clarification and with which firms had been struggling. In July, the Commission published its long-awaited Q&A
opens in a new tab
 (PDF 602 KB), which is helpful in some areas, but in others simply repeats the ESAs' questions or cites sections of the SFDR text, without providing clarification on interpretation or practical implementation. In brief:
1. Does the provision of SFDR apply to non-EU AIFMs1 and registered AIFMs?
EC: No to non-EU AIFMs (but product disclosures may apply if funds are marketed in the EU); yes to registered (i.e. sub-threshold) AIFMs
2. How should you apply the 500-employee threshold for principal adverse impact reporting at entity level to parent undertakings of a large group? Should it include both EU and non-EU entities, and should the due diligence statement include impacts of the parent undertaking only or include the impacts of the group at a consolidated level?
EC: The headcount is linked to the parent undertaking being a “financial market participant” (FMP) under SFDR. If it is, any subsidiaries beneath it are caught. If it is not, its own headcount is not included. Instead, the headcount is focused on the employees of the subsidiary undertaking that is the FMP.
3. What is the meaning of “promotion” in the context of products `promoting' environmental or social characteristics (Article 8)?
EC: Integration of sustainability risks (per SFDR Article 2(22)) is not sufficient for Article 8 to apply. Promotion “encompasses, by way of example, direct or indirect claims, information, reporting, disclosures as well as an impression that investments pursued by the given financial product also consider environmental or social characteristics in terms of investment policies, goals, targets or objectives or a general ambition”. These disclosures may appear in a wide range of documents or media.
4. How should you apply Article 9 of SFDR?
EC: Article 9 products may invest in a wide range of underlying assets, provided they qualify as sustainable investments under SFDR Article 2(17). In order to meet requirements in accordance with prudential, product-related sector-specific rules, an Article 9 product may include investments for certain specific purposes such as hedging or liquidity, but these must also meet minimum environmental or social safeguards to be in line with the sustainable investment objective.
5. How should you apply SFDR disclosure rules to MIFID portfolios and other tailored products? And if they apply at the portfolio level, how is it possible to maintain client confidentiality obligations?
EC: Confidentiality and data protection requirements under EU and national laws owed to the individual client may prevail over the requirement to disclose information pursuant to SFDR Article 10 on a public part of the FMP's website. Depending on the FMP's jurisdiction and the applicable statutory level of protection, this may require the portfolio manager mandate to include strong language as to confidentiality owed to clients.

https://kpmg.com/xx/en/our-insights/regulatory-insights/use-of-dlt-in-fmi.html,Regulatory Insights,Use of DLT in FMI,,"Institutional interest in distributed ledger technology (DLT)  — particularly in the realm of financial market infrastructures (FMIs) — continues to deepen. International regulators continue to successfully trial various use cases and are also in the final stages of launching sandbox initiatives. Market participants should consider taking advantage of these opportunities in order to reap the benefits of potential front-to-back innovation in trading and post-trading processes.
DLT comes in two forms  — permissionless or permissioned  — based on the level of decentralisation. Our previous update described how, for mainstream institutions, the future likely lies in the latter. In the case of FMI players specifically, research by the IMF
opens in a new tab
 confirms that only permissioned networks are suitable.
Within this context, FMIs across developed and developing markets, and along various parts of the value chain, have been actively investigating DLT opportunities for many years. The technology demonstrates potential for financial infrastructures to move toward real-time settlement, continuous operations, improved resilience and global reach. It could also fundamentally change the role of intermediaries operating within the securities trading, clearing and settlement cycle, particularly if activities currently performed by separate FMIs can all be performed on the same ledger. 
In order to experiment with harnessing these benefits in a safe and secure way, regulators in several jurisdictions are preparing to launch pilot projects and sandbox initiatives.

EU

In this respect, the EU has been a first mover. Final regulation
opens in a new tab
 has been agreed for the pilot regime for market infrastructures based on DLT (which ESMA has now dubbed DLTR) — which sets out a legal framework for the trading and settlement of transactions in crypto-assets that qualify as financial instruments (under MiFID II). Similar to a sandbox approach, the pilot allows for `safe experimentation' and will provide evidence for a potential subsequent permanent regime.
DLTR was introduced in September 2020 as part of the Digital Finance Package
opens in a new tab
, alongside the Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation (MiCA
opens in a new tab
) and the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA
opens in a new tab
). 
Under the pilot:
Authorised financial institutions (including investment firms, market operators, central securities depositaries (CSDs)) will still require specific permission to participate. Access will not be limited to incumbent institutions but will also be open to new entrants 
Permission is limited to a period of up to six years and will be periodically reviewed 
Permission will be valid throughout the EU 
Participating operators will be subject to various organisational requirements (robust IT and cyber arrangements, sufficient safeguarding arrangements, record-keeping obligations, investor protection arrangements, KYC/AML requirements, etc)
Competent authorities may decide to require additional prudential safeguards from an individual operator 
There are limitations on the financial instruments that can be admitted. Only less-liquid bonds, share and fund units can participate and the aggregate market capitalisation or value cannot exceed €6Bn at the moment of admission to trading (or initial recording) of a new DLT instrument
Once permission to operate in the pilot has been granted, DLT operators will then be able to request exemptions from current regulations including: 
Intermediation  — direct access for natural persons to deal on own account as DLT infrastructure participants is possible 
Transaction reporting (under MiFIR
opens in a new tab
)  
Recording and settling DLT financial instruments with a CSD — operators will be allowed to combine the activities normally performed by both Multilateral Trading Facilities (MTFs) and CSDs
Settlement discipline requirements
CSDR settlement finality requirements
Rules on cash settlement — however, delivery versus payment (DvP) still has to be ensured
Various actions now lie with ESMA. The securities regulator is currently consulting on draft guidelines to establish standard formats and templates for the submission of the required information by market participants to the competent authorities. It is looking to finalise this ahead of March 2023, when the DLTR provisions go live.
ESMA is also required to assess MiFIR regulatory technical standards (RTSs) on trade and transaction reporting to see whether they need adapting to be effectively applied to DLT financial instruments.
And finally, ESMA has been tasked with creating a report (by March 2026) on the success of the pilot and any recommended next steps.

UK

The UK is set to follow the EU's lead, although with a slightly slower timeline. 
The responses received to HM Treasury's (HMT) 2021 Call for Evidence
opens in a new tab
 identified the need for a re-evaluation of the legislative framework to enable a successful application of DLT to FMIs. As such, in July, HMT introduced, via the new Financial Services and Markets Bill
opens in a new tab
, the ability to establish FMI regulatory sandboxes. 
Within these sandboxes, HMT will be able to temporarily disapply or modify relevant legislation, to allow participating FMIs to “test and adopt new technologies and practices”. This aligns with the EU's DLTR and is a step away from the FCA's original regulatory sandbox
opens in a new tab
 (launched in 2016). However, unlike the EU equivalent, the scope of these UK sandboxes is intentionally not limited to DLT, in order to maintain technology neutrality. 
HMT intends to consult industry on the proposed list of legislation in scope for modification and retains the ability to amend this list in the future. HMT will also be able to make permanent changes to legislation (via statutory instrument subject to the affirmative procedure) based on what is learned in each sandbox, having first reported back to Parliament. 
An FMI sandbox will be created by a statutory instrument, and a full impact assessment will be provided as and when that occurs. Each statutory instrument will set out:
The relevant legislation to be modified or disapplied
The activities that FMIs are permitted to undertake 
Requirements and restrictions for participants (e.g. the types of securities to be traded and settled) 
The role and enforcement powers of the regulators 
The duration of the sandbox 
The processes for winding down or transitioning activities at the end of a sandbox
Examples of potential FMI entities include existing recognised CSDs and operators of MTFs, though the scope could be extended to include other categories in the future. These entities will be required to apply to the regulators in order to participate in the sandbox, and only a limited number will be selected. 
Despite policy work already being underway, the sandboxes will not formally launch until early 2023 (following formal assent of the Bill).

Other jurisdictions

Further afield, wider DLT experimentation continues to progress.  
In September 2021, SIX Digital Exchange
opens in a new tab
 (SDX) in Switzerland received regulatory approval from FINMA to operate SDX, an end-to-end, fully regulated exchange and CSD for the listing, trading, settlement and custody of digital assets. It aims to allow financial institutions to trade digitised shares, bonds and other assets on DLT. Their first bond was issued in November.
In January 2022, Phase II of Project Helvetia
opens in a new tab
 was completed. This was a multi-phase investigation by the BIS Innovation Hub, the Swiss National Bank and the financial infrastructure operator SIX, exploring how central banks could offer settlement in central bank money in a scenario involving tokenised assets based on DLT. Phase II specifically demonstrated that a wholesale CBDC can be integrated with existing core banking systems and processes of commercial and central banks. 
And, the Australian Securities Exchange is currently working to replace its legacy post-trade system (CHESS) with a DLT-based system. As a result, market participants will be able to communicate with the new DLT based service via SWIFT or by hosting a DLT node. (However, it's worth noting that, due to the complexity of the process, this roll-out has been delayed several times since it was first announced in 2016).

Residual risks

Despite the progress of this experimentation, certain shortcomings and risks still persist, including: 
The IMF
opens in a new tab
 has reported that most experiments to-date are still being completed “under controlled and technology-focused environments” with no “cost-benefit analysis”. They also note that many reported DLT benefits (like parallel transaction databases secured by encryption and validators) can also be implemented by traditional payment systems 
Moreover, transitioning from complex and embedded legacy systems onto DLT infrastructure will be a delicate and complex process, involving increased effort and expense. Market participants would likely be required to complete their functions on legacy systems while simultaneously testing DLT, to avoid disrupting critical daily processes and to ensure that markets continue to operate seamlessly
Further analysis is needed on the primary and secondary impacts of wide-spread adoption of DLT within payments, clearing and settlement arrangements. Regulators and legislators should account for the market restructuring and elimination of participants that could come as a result
Use of DLT would also require the development of appropriate governance to ensure that responsibilities regarding data handling and cyber resilience are fully committed to by all network participants
Interoperability (between DLT and non-DLT solutions, and between different types of DLT solutions) must be ensured, so as to avoid fragmentation of the trade-settlement process
And finally, some versions of the technology can be extremely energy-consumptive and may not sit comfortably alongside efforts to tackle climate change and achieve net-zero
Overall, the ECB
opens in a new tab
 notes that the ultimate aim should be to achieve industry-wide international agreement on the approach to DLT via the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI) and the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), as this would facilitate long-term interoperability and integration between securities markets globally.

What does this mean for clients?

As applications open for these sandbox initiatives, market participants should make the most of the opportunities at hand. Having the ability to trial new DLT-based business models in an environment of suspended regulatory expectations will position them well for the ecosystem of the future. In particular, it will place them close to the action as the permanent regulatory regimes are determined.

Measuring the impact of regulatory and supervisory activity

The KPMG Regulatory Barometer helps firms identify the key areas of pressure across the evolving UK and EU regulatory landscape.
Financial Services firms need to handle frequent regulatory updates from multiple sources and it can be difficult to distil the impacts of regulatory change and supervisory actions into a single view. 
Ongoing geopolitical tensions, uncertain economic conditions, changing customer demands and behaviours, sustainability concerns and use of new technologies are all influencing regulatory agendas. 
The Barometer:
Delivers a consolidated source of regulatory intelligence.
Assesses the extent of regulatory pressure across key themes.
Provides a single metric to represent the size and complexity of the challenge.
A regulatory impact score is calculated for each of the Barometer key themes based on attributes such as volume of regulatory updates, materiality, time to implementation and supervisory intensity. The theme scores feed into a single overarching metric that represents the overall level of regulatory pressure.

Quantifying regulatory pressure

Welcome to the latest edition of the KPMG Regulatory Barometer – measuring the impact of regulatory and supervisory activity.

Insights for the changing world

Key messages

Political changes in the last six months have resulted in some regulatory policy activity being put on hold. Competitiveness and growth are expected to be key areas of government focus in both the EU & UK, eventually having a regulatory impact. 
Financial Resilience retains the top spot and is now joined by Operational Resilience. Both reflect a refocusing on critical processes, operations and metrics in the wake of market events and score highly in terms of both policy pressure and supervisory intensity. Finalisation of significant policy initiatives and approaching implementation deadlines are contributing factors. 
ESG and Sustainable Finance remains very high on the regulatory agenda, but there has been a small drop in score. We attribute this to a slowing in publication of new policy, either due to election quiet periods or pending the outcome of reviews in progress. It is possible that the score will tick back up in the next 6 to 12 months. Supervisory intensity is also likely to pick up on the back of the FCA's AGR and implementation of the CSRD and other reporting requirements and associated assurance requirements. 
Renewed policy interest in how financial services firms and the capital markets can contribute to the growth agenda is influencing regulatory pressure. Policymakers are considering ways to drive investment to the domestic economy – including into infrastructure and unlisted assets.
There has been a resurgence in pressure around Customer Protection. This has been heavily influenced by the volume, proactivity and targeted nature of supervisory attention that UK’s FCA is dedicating to Consumer Duty. 
The score for Digital Finance has increased but not enough to challenge Customer Protection. Digital remains an area where there is a lot of noise in the market, but less in terms of concrete policy and specific actions required from Financial Services firms.
The score for Accessing Markets has fallen, once more, as post-Brexit policy and supervisory measures increasingly transition to business as usual activity.

Theme overviews

Post-Brexit, the EU and UK are now following their own policymaking agendas. However, fundamental regulatory concerns continue to be shared and the first Joint EU-UK Financial Regulatory Forum has established the framework for ongoing discussion and collaboration.
Divergence of policy detail and timing increases complexity for cross-border firms. The UK has begun to tailor rules to a more UK-centric and principles-based style of rulemaking, while the EU has its own complex legislative agenda for financial services. Both jurisdictions are considering the impact of regulation on competitiveness.
As part of the Edinburgh Reforms, HMT is moving forward with the repealing and reforming of 43 ‘core files’ of retained EU law in a way that is ‘thoughtfully planned and sequenced to minimise unnecessary disruption while taking the opportunity to maximise the potential for the greatest economic impact’. The Treasury Select Committee reported that progress has been too slow, to which the government responded by asserting that the current plans allow an appropriate amount of time for consultation and implementation.
EU and UK regulatory requirements align to different extents across the nine Barometer themes – in some cases reflecting different starting points due to previous UK and EU Member State ‘gold-plating’ and national rules.

https://kpmg.com/xx/en/our-insights/regulatory-insights/basel-4-the-final-countdown.html,Regulatory Insights,Basel 4 – the final countdown?,,"The Basel Committee’s 1 January 2023 implementation date for Basel 4 is approaching rapidly, with banks expecting to hear soon hear precisely what will be required of them in the EU, UK and US. Regulators are sticking to their guns on the need for completion of the final reforms although some banks question the timing. Implementation has been deferred once due to the pandemic and may be delayed further due to the regulatory process.
On 6 July 2021, the Basel Committee for Banking Supervision (BCBS) published its preliminary assessment1 of the effectiveness of implemented Basel reforms during the COVID-19 pandemic. The report found that higher quality capital and liquidity levels required by the reforms had helped banks to absorb the impact of the shock. As had been said in many speeches and in many industry forums over the previous months, the banking system would have found itself under much greater stress were it not for the lessons learned and, crucially, acted upon, in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis and the support measures taken by public authorities.
There has been broad consensus from regulators and bankers about the value of the measures implemented so far, but with the deferred 1 January 2023 date looming, and with policy announcements expected imminently in the UK, EU and US, banks must now move forward with the Basel 3 final reforms, variously referred to as Basel 3.1 or Basel 4.
And here opinion has been divided: regulators insist that implementation must press forward in accordance with the BCBS timeline and without major deviations from the globally agreed standard. Banks are arguing for consideration of the additional stress that this would place them under, particularly in reference to additional capital requirements, the output floor, and considerations of proportionality and regional specificity.
Recap — what is Basel 4?
Basel 4 refers to the finalisation of the Basel 3 reform package which had taken more than a decade to develop and was split into two pieces – the final amendments elements being agreed by the Basel Committee in December 2017. Basel 4 included new standards for credit risk and operational risk and a credit valuation adjustment. It also introduced an output floor, revisions to the definition of the leverage ratio and the application of the leverage ratio to global systemically important banks. A revised market risk framework had already been largely finalised in January 2016.
The implementation timeline
Implementation of Basel 4 was originally intended to start on 1 January 2022, with a phasing in of the output floor to 1 January 2027. In March 2020, in response to the pandemic, the BCBS deferred the implementation timeline for Basel 4 by 12 months, from 1 January 2022 to 1 January 2023.
Key regulatory announcements are required in order to implement Basel 4 in the EU, UK and US:
The European Commission is expected to present its CRR3 legislative proposal on 27 October
Released from the requirement to follow CRR3 post-Brexit, the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) is targeting the end of 2021 for its consultation paper on UK implementation, although this may run over into early 2022. A policy statement will follow later in 2022
In the US, a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPR) is expected from the Federal Reserve Board in November
Support from central banks and regulators
EU and UK Central banks and prudential regulators have been unequivocal in their support for the remaining reforms and the BCBS timeline.
In a letter2 in September 2021, the European Central Bank (ECB) and European Banking Authority (EBA) called on the European Commission to stick to the letter and spirit of the Basel reforms, supporting a “full, timely and consistent implementation of all aspects of the (…) framework”. They described the final reforms as “essential to maintain the credibility of European banking regulation and confidence in European banks” and noted that any additional postponement “would be to the detriment of the European public interest”.
The ECB and EBA specifically defended the output floor which was designed to limit variability in how banks risk-weight their assets and therefore improve consistency and comparability and warned against moves towards a more flexible “parallel stack” approach3 such as that championed by the European Banking Federation (EBF).
In the UK, HM Treasury (HMT) and the PRA have expressed support for completion of the implementation in a way that is faithful to the Basel text: “We remain committed to the full, timely and consistent implementation of the Basel 3.1 standards and we will work together towards a UK implementation timetable that is consistent with the one year delay”4.
The US is also understood to be targeting January 2023 although final capital rules are yet to be set.
Concerns from banks
Banks in the EU cite the difficulties of continuing to lend to the real economy and supporting the transitions to green and digital finance if the reforms proceed as planned. They continue to challenge the regulators on questions of proportionality and the “level playing field”, arguing that Basel 4 disadvantages them versus their US or global counterparts. Some banks support the exercise of national flexibility to the fullest, while regulators support a more harmonised approach. There are also questions around application of the output floor at consolidated or solo level and elements of the capital stack to be considered for the output floor.
Banks have been quick to reference the BCBS principle that capital requirements should not be higher as a result of the reforms. However, Basel 4 will increase capital requirements for those banks which are likely undercapitalised, which is how the framework was intended to operate. At the system level, the relative cost of capital for banks will change depending on their business model. Banks should be considering how to manage potential increases in their capital requirements, for example by combining Pillar 1 and Pillar 2 measures and ensuring thorough capital planning. 
Where do we go from here?
There is no doubt that banks are better capitalised and have more liquidity than they did in past crises. They functioned well through the pandemic, but this was due in no small part to government support, without which capital buffers might not have been able to absorb the impacts - hence the regulators insistence that the full benefits of the Basel reforms will only be realised when the programme is complete.
Despite lobbying in the EU, there is a strong desire from legislators and regulators to stick to globally agreed standards.
In September 2021, Carolyn Rogers, Secretary General of BCBS expressed5 concern that some stakeholders continue to lobby against a consistent and timely implementation of Basel 4 and reflected that some “fault-lines” in the banking system “remain as important as they were pre-pandemic”. She pointed in particular to banks’ measurement of capital requirements using internal models and the need for an output floor to address issues of consistency and comparability. She also rejected the arguments for disproportionate impacts on certain banks and certain jurisdictions saying that “any stakeholder that argues that a global standard needs to be domestically adjusted to reduce the impact on outlier banks has lost sight of the purpose and value of the global standards”.
Delays and divergence
It is possible that the implementation date will move again, but this will be due to the legislative or regulatory process rather than a dilution of intent. The regulators have admitted that it has been challenging to land final policy and, based on typical timelines, it may simply not be practicable to implement until 2024 or later.
It is also possible that the legislative and regulatory proposals will result in different approaches in different regions. Whilst it is too early to say how significant these differences might be, banks with international operations will need to factor in the potential for diverging requirements in each major location and adapt accordingly.
Early indications suggest that the European Commission will indeed stick to the “single stack” but will look for other ways to keep capital increases below 10%, such as applying the requirements at the highest level of consolidation. The EU may opt to use flexibility in the framework, for example to reduce the impact of historical losses feeding through to capital, deployment of transitional regimes for loans to unrated corporates and low-risk mortgages and maintaining regional carve-outs for small businesses, infrastructure and derivatives.
In the US, with a new Vice Chair for Supervision due to be appointed in October, it is possible that previous references to maintaining capital neutrality may ultimately give way to a harder line.
Whatever the final proposals and timelines look like, banks must now engage or re-engage with the potential requirements of Basel 4. The clock is ticking.

https://kpmg.com/xx/en/our-insights/regulatory-insights/regulatory-perspectives-on-d-i.html,Regulatory Insights,Regulatory perspectives on D&I,,"Regulatory Perspectives on Diversity and Inclusion

Diversity and inclusion (D&I) have risen to the top of the corporate agenda, driven by customers, shareholders and employees who want to see their concerns for the fair treatment of all individuals put into action. The Bank of England, PRA and FCA’s joint discussion paper clearly marked D&I as a priority issue for the financial services sector and invited firms to contribute their views on how they should be embedded into business practices. The discussion paper provides an insight on the lenses through which key UK regulators view diversity, and how their mandates and objectives interact with a diverse and inclusive financial market. It aims to consciously stimulate discussion to generate a better consultation paper and, ultimately, more impactful policy.
When we think of ‘diversity’, it’s easy to stop at the relatively simple level of the characteristics that were defined under the Equality Act 2010 and which form the basis of many of the statutory protections we see in everyday business. However, UK regulators are now going further, recognising that diversity can cut across multiple characteristics and demographics. People often have multiple diverse characteristics which contribute to their thoughts and opinions, and it is important to make sure that all of these are considered.
So, why is it so important that everyone’s voice is heard?
There’s the principle of fairness, of course.  Discrimination has no place in our society. However, the report also highlights the reality that diverse perspectives can play an important role in ensuring the stability and economic wellbeing of the financial sector, and that a uniform and exclusive financial market is unlikely to offer the competition and responsible stewardship expected of it. From a conduct perspective, the link between culture and D&I must not be ignored – D&I is one of the mechanisms through which the FCA will assess culture and the lever it will use to drive improvement.
From a risk management perspective, board and senior leadership teams that include a range of perspectives might challenge entrenched practices more robustly, and having a greater variety of skills and experiences at a senior level will increase the quality of discussion and debate. The paper references a study which found that boards with greater female representation were less likely to receive misconduct fines, indicating that not only are outcomes better for firms, but better for customers too. However, to be effective, firms need to recognise that D&I must be embedded at all levels (and in all departments) of a firm – not just at board level.
Customers can benefit in other ways too. A retail firm which has a range of voices and experiences at key decision-making levels is likely to empathise with and understand the needs of  a diverse customer base more effectively. It is possible that the needs of customers will be missed or not considered at all when there isn’t anyone in the business who truly understands what those needs are.
There is a third way in which diverse and inclusive practices can help to meet regulatory objectives: competition. Without diverse input, the range of products and services risks failing to respond to what the market and customers really need. Opportunities for growth exist, now and in the future, but without the ability to identify, develop and deliver them the market just won’t evolve as it could and should and firms will lose business. Whether it is making retail products friendlier to families which don’t fit the traditional nuclear mould or developing trustworthy and transparent green investments, there is scope for firms to lead the way into the future of finance by embedding diversity and inclusion into their product governance frameworks.
The FCA reinforced its view of culture and purpose as a ‘key priority’ in a speech on 22 September 2021, noting that the ‘new normal’ introduced by the COVID-19 pandemic must be a landscape of inclusion and that increasingly firms should expect to be challenged on their ESG strategy.
Where does this leave firms? The proposed initiatives are wide reaching, and while some of them may feel challenging to achieve, there are plenty which firms may already be doing, even without realising. Others may require action right now and some may even overlap or interact with a firm’s agenda on other social issues, such as supporting leadership on Black Lives Matters, or women’s pay gap reporting. Whatever stage firms are at though, the message is clear – diversity and inclusion will form a key aspect of regulatory considerations going forward.

Mastering the maze of change

The complexities facing tax departments are reaching new heights. But while C-suite leaders largely agree that the current environment in tax is more challenging than ever before to predict and plan for, tax leaders are hopeful about the opportunities ahead.

In line with past survey findings, the top disruptors impacting corporate tax functions – around talent and emerging technologies – are still top-of-mind for the C-suite.

Generative AI : the missing puzzle piece

For tax departments, AI is no longer a new frontier or abstract concept. And as companies infuse AI into everything they do, they’re met with new hurdles as professionals learn what AI integration looks like in practice.

A vast majority of leaders (88%) believe generative AI is the key to helping their organizations navigate the challenges brought on by Pillar Two.

https://kpmg.com/xx/en/our-insights/regulatory-insights/sustainable-finance-and-the-capital-market.html,Regulatory Insights,Sustainable finance and the capital markets,,"Policymakers are turning their attention to the regulation of players in the wholesale capital markets. Calls for ESG data and rating providers to be regulated have increased, standards for bond issuers are being debated and developments in the carbon market are being monitored closely.
Asset owners (including insurance companies, pension funds and collective investment funds) and asset managers have been grappling for some time with new ESG-related regulation on disclosures and company processes, the detail of which continues to grow. And banks and insurers have been embedding ESG factors (especially climate change) into their risk management frameworks and stress tests. Now the spotlight is turning on players in the wholesale capital markets. Regulation will inevitably follow.
In addition to the three topics covered below, other areas are under review. For example, as well as increased reporting by listed companies, ESMA's annual work programme
opens in a new tab
 (PDF 589 KB) includes consideration of amendments that might be needed to the EU Securitisation Regulation, the UK Benchmarks Regulation is being revised
opens in a new tab
 (PDF 245 KB) to improve disclosures and refer to the Paris-aligned benchmarks, and an EU Social Bond Standard is expected.
Wholesale firms need to respond to the demands of regulators and customers. They need to integrate ESG considerations into their business strategies, processes and product offerings, improve transparency and be prepared for greater regulatory scrutiny.
Calls for regulation of ESG ratings and data
The variations observed in ESG1 ratings of issuers by different credit rating agencies (CRAs) are much greater than the usual spreads in ratings. This has led to concerns among both issuers and users about the methodologies used by CRAs and data providers. Calls for them to be regulated - to address the conflicts of interest in them both collecting and selling data, and to improve transparency about their methodologies - have increased. A new report
opens in a new tab
 (PDF 609 KB) from IOSCO2 has lent weight to these calls.
IOSCO notes that the role and influence of ESG ratings and data products providers in financial markets, and in the sustainable finance ecosystem more specifically, have grown significantly. However, it found little clarity and alignment on definitions, lack of transparency about methodologies used, uneven coverage, concerns about the management of conflicts of interest and a need for improved communication with rated companies.
The report, therefore, sets out a number of recommendations, starting with a proposal that regulators could consider focusing greater attention on the use and activities of ESG ratings and data products in their jurisdictions. Recommendations addressed to ESG ratings and data products providers suggest that they consider a number of factors related to issuing high-quality ratings and data products. This includes publicly-disclosed data sources, defined methodologies, management of conflicts of interest, high levels of transparency and handling confidential information. IOSCO also suggests that users of ESG ratings and data products could consider conducting due diligence on the providers they use within their internal processes. The last set of recommendations focuses on improved information-gathering processes, disclosures and communication between providers and entities subject to assessment.
In the EU, as part of its direct supervision of CRAs, ESMA will assess the way they incorporate ESG factors into their methodologies for credit ratings and outlooks, how they ensure the robustness of their methodologies and their disclosure of ESG factors in credit ratings.
In the UK, the FCA has also noted

 similar emerging issues and potential harm from the increasingly prominent role of ESG ratings and data. The provision of ESG ratings and data is currently an unregulated activity in the UK, but the FCA is engaging

The challenges that regulators have identified in this area are similar to those that were found in the credit rating and benchmarks sectors. So, potential international principles and regulation could be modelled on the IOSCO Principles for Financial Benchmarks

An EU Green Bond Standard (GBS)
The EU GBS Regulation proposed
opens in a new tab
 by the Commission, which is now being debated by the European Parliament and the Council, aims to address concerns about “greenwashing” and protect market integrity, to ensure that legitimate environmental projects are financed. It will be a voluntary standard available to all issuers, both private and sovereign, and to non-EU as well as EU issuers.
The four key requirements under the proposed framework are:
Funds raised by the bond must be allocated fully to projects aligned with the EU Taxonomy.
Full transparency on how bond proceeds are allocated, through detailed reporting requirements.
Checking by an external reviewer to ensure compliance with the Regulation and that funded projects are aligned with the EU Taxonomy (with specific, limited flexibility for sovereign issuers).
External reviewers must be registered with and supervised by ESMA, to ensure the quality and reliability of their services and reviews (again, with specific, limited flexibility for sovereign issuers).
For those issuers that choose to (or for which market forces necessitate that they) follow the GBS, the mandatory requirement for external review is a new feature for ESG regulation in the financial markets. It may be a sign of things to come in the expected Social Bond Standard and EU Eco-label for retail investment products. If any such reviewers are part of groups that also provide ESG ratings or data, the question of management of conflicts of interest will likely be at the forefront of regulators' minds.
ESMA monitors the EU carbon market 
ESMA has published a preliminary report
opens in a new tab
 (PDF 1 MB) on the EU carbon market, in response to a request by the European Commission for an analysis of European emission allowances (EUAs) and derivatives on EUAs. The report notes that:
The number of counterparties holding a position on EUA futures has tended to increase since 2018 in all categories of counterparties, in line with the observed expansion of the EU Emissions Trading System market.
Open positions are to a large extent, and almost evenly, held by investment firms and credit institutions on the one hand and by non-financial counterparties on the other hand. The remaining percentage of open positions, held by investment funds and other financial counterparties, remains relatively low.
The breakdown of open positions between the various categories of counterparties does not appear to have significantly changed since 2018. It is broadly in line with the expected functioning of the market, where non-financial entities buy EUA futures to hedge their carbon price exposure, while financial counterparties act as intermediaries to facilitate trading and provide liquidity to the market.
The report also provides an overview of the regulatory environment for the EU carbon market under financial regulations such as MiFID II/MiFIR, MAR3  and EMIR4, which covers over-the-counter derivatives. Since 2018, EUAs have been classified as financial instruments and have been subject to a series of requirements aimed at ensuring the transparency and the integrity of the market. In particular, entities trading in EUAs and their derivatives must provide data to their national regulators.
ESMA will deliver its final report to the Commission in early 2022. The Commission will then assess whether there is a need for targeted actions in the EU carbon market. Meanwhile, the financial services industry is calling for scaling up of the carbon markets and emission trading schemes, and inter-operability between different types of markets and jurisdictions.

https://kpmg.com/xx/en/our-insights/regulatory-insights/product-governance-evolving-expectations.html,Regulatory Insights,Product governance: evolving expectations,,"As forewarned in the October 2020 edition, ESMA has launched a common supervisory action (CSA) on how MiFID II product governance requirements have been implemented around the EU. Firms also need to prepare for new requirements to incorporate consideration of sustainability factors into their product governance arrangements by early 2022, and the wider MiFID II review may herald further changes to product governance requirements. Meanwhile, firms need to consider the impact of the pandemic on the investments in their portfolios, and what that means for individual funds and fund investors.
The overall messages from regulators and supervisors are that firms should ensure their product governance arrangements are fit-for-purpose, are aligned to changing regulatory requirements and evolving supervisory expectations, and stand up to robust and objective challenge. Products should deliver good customer outcomes (value of money) and firms should be able to evidence this.

Questions for CEOs

Are we proactively and regularly revisiting the stress testing of our funds and service offerings to consider the impact of the pandemic on the underlying assets?
Are we challenging ourselves on the level of costs and charges in our funds and on value for investors?
Are we receiving and analysing information from distributors about how are funds are viewed and used?
Are we robustly and objectively assessing and reviewing the target market for each fund?
Does the compliance function play an active part in our product governance arrangements?
Are we preparing for the incorporation of sustainability factors throughout our product governance arrangements?

ESMA's expectations and questions

In June 2020, ESMA published guidance
opens in a new tab
 (PDF395 KB) designed to provide clarification for the compliance function. This guidance included confirmation that compliance should be formally involved in the development and maintenance of a firm's product governance framework, policies and processes. Further, ESMA expects the compliance function to play a part in each product or service approval, whether relating to manufacturing or distribution.
It has now launched
opens in a new tab
 a CSA with national competent authorities (NCAs) on the application of MiFID II product governance rules across the EU. The CSA will be conducted during 2021 and its aim is to ensure consistent implementation and application of EU rules and to enhance the protection of investors. ESMA and the NCAs will assess progress made by manufacturers and distributors of financial products, including:
How manufacturers ensure that the costs and charges within financial products are compatible with the needs, objectives and characteristics of their target market and do not undermine the product's return expectations
How manufacturers and distributors identify and periodically review the target market and distribution strategy of financial products
What information is exchanged between manufacturers and distributors and how frequently this is done
These points were much debated within the funds industry when MiFID II was implemented. Fund managers, whether of UCITS of alternative investment funds (AIFs), are not subject to MiFID II, but fund distributors are. Therefore, in order to ensure their funds are distributed, managers have to provide target market information on their funds, which is generally done via an industry-agreed template. Similarly, fund managers are not required by EU law to request information from distributors about how their funds are being used in practice, but if they do not consider such information, there is a risk that their funds will become out of line with the target market expectations of distributors. In addition, some NCAs expect asset managers to play a part in the product governance arrangements of funds whose assets they manage.

Fund managers should pay close attention to how this work progresses and ESMA's findings and recommendations.

MiFID II review

In December 2020, the EU co-legislators provisionally agreed the final form of the Capital Markets Recovery Package proposed by the Commission in July 2020. (See KPMG's Regulatory Horizons, February 2021.) The package was billed as adjusting the legislation to allow capital markets to assist in the recovery of the European economy from the impact of the pandemic. The product governance regime has been simplified, with all financial instruments exclusively distributed to eligible counterparties now excluded from the requirements.
The co-legislators debated whether to define non-structured UCITS as “simple” products and exempt them from the product governance requirements. This option did make the final text. The final change was only that, for both professional and retail clients, certain product governance requirements will no longer apply to corporate bonds with “make-whole clauses”.
It is possible that the position of non-structured UCITS will be debated again as part of the fuller review. Also on the table is the introduction of a new category of “semi-professional” investors, which might have access to a wider set of funds.

Incorporating sustainability

The amendments proposed by the European Commission to Level 2 rules on the integration of sustainability factors, under UCITS, AIFMD and MiFID II, require firms to consider clients' ESG preferences in suitability assessments and to embed consideration of ESG (environmental, social, governance) factors into their product governance and risk management processes.
In its advice to the Commission on the Level 2 amendments, ESMA noted that asset managers will have to set up new controls and potentially hire more staff, so that firms have “sufficient human and technical resources for the assessment of sustainability risks”.
The final rules are expected to be issued soon, with an implementation deadline of 12 months. Firms will need to refer to the Taxonomy Regulation - the compulsory dictionary of “E”. The draft Level 2 rules under the Taxonomy Regulation, in relation to climate change mitigation and adaptation are detailed and total 500 pages. For more on ESG regulation, see our new reality paper, “Delivering sustainable finance” (PDF 1.8 MB).
Firms need to start the implementation process now. They need to clarify their strategy and amend processes, policies and documentation, not only initially but on an ongoing basis as part of their product governance arrangements.

Pandemic impacts

Funds have been subject to stress throughout the pandemic due to market volatility and impacts on portfolio companies and other underlying assets. Scenario testing needs to be revisited and on an ongoing basis. Firms also need to ensure that product development and distribution methods are genuinely aligned to investors' best interests. They need to manage the entire product lifecycle from the investors' perspective, and to ensure their product assessments are robust and objective, in order to generate customer outcomes that are acceptable to supervisors and the market.

 of four legislative proposals aims to “improve the ability of companies to raise capital across the EU and ensure that Europeans get the best deals for their savings and investments” by:

Details on the MiFIR proposal
The Commission's aim with the MiFIR proposal
opens in a new tab
 is to “improve transparency and availability of market data, improve the level-playing field between execution venues and ensure that EU market infrastructures can remain competitive at international level.”  Many of the proposals have been recommended in ESMA review reports over the last two years and generally aim to bring efficiencies and improvements to the existing regulation rather than wholesale change. The main proposals are:
Various amendments to improve the conditions for consolidated tapes by mandating trading venues to contribute their data to a consolidated tape provider (CTP), harmonising data standards, requiring CTPs to share revenue with data contributors and introducing a selection procedure for the appointment of a CTP for each asset class (shares, ETFs, bonds and derivatives)
Changing the double volume cap to a single volume cap which will rely only on an EU-wide threshold of 7% (the venue threshold will be removed)
Increasing Systematic Internalisers' (SIs) transparency obligations, including aligning SI reporting formats and obligations with those applicable to exchanges, multi-lateral trading facilities (MTFs) and organised trading facilities (OTFs)
Reducing the scope of non-equity trade reporting deferrals and harmonising the deferral regime, by instigating EU-wide, rather than national, thresholds
Introducing the obligation that multilateral systems have to operate with a trading venue licence — to address the issue that software providers could be acting as trading venues
Clarification that the share trading obligation (STO) applies only to shares with an EEA ISIN and establish an EU `official list' of shares subject to the STO
Banning payment for order flow to try to improve best execution for investors
Removing `open access obligation' for exchange-traded derivatives - already postponed several times
Aligning the derivatives trading obligation (DTO) with the clearing obligation
A wider MiFID II review is expected in 2022, however the proposal includes related amendments to MiFID II to:
Remove the licencing requirement for persons dealing on own account on a trading venue by means of direct electronic access (DEA), in line with ESMA recommendation on algorithmic trading
Oblige investments firms, MTFs, OTFs and regulated markets to meet data standards enacted in the MiFIR proposals, to assist with consolidated tape
Allow for sanctions for infringements of new provisions in MiFIR on data quality, mandatory data contributions and payment for order flow
Comparison with UK proposals 
The UK Government launched its proposals
opens in a new tab
 to amend UK onshored MiFID II/MIFIR in July 2021. There is some consistency between the UK and EU proposals — alignment of the DTO with the clearing obligation and a focus on establishing a consolidated tape. But there is also divergence — the UK will completely revoke
opens in a new tab
 the double volume cap and the STO. 
Next steps
The EU and UK proposals will both require legislative changes and amendments to technical standards/the rule book. The Commission's proposals will now be debated and negotiated by the European Parliament and the Council. HM Treasury is likely to present the UK legislative changes in early 2022. ESMA and the FCA will issue further consultations on the technical standards/rule book changes over the next few months. The timing of all these changes is likely to be spread over the next year.  
The differences in the proposals may further complicate the operating environment for firms. To plan effectively for the probable change needed to systems (and possibly business models), firms working in these jurisdictions should keep track of the developments and finalisation of the proposals.

Will one global set of definitions, reporting standards and metrics emerge?
There is progress, but there is still a long way to go. Political and social momentum is on the side of policymakers seeking to reach agreement on standards, but the journey to convergence will not be easy. The more detailed standards and rules become in one jurisdiction, the more difficult it may be for others to converge with them.
At each stage of the convergence journey, a balance needs to be struck between detail and flexibility. Regulators and standard-setters need to be aware of the risk of over-stepping their mandates and over-directing capital flows. Industry is calling for clarification of minimum standards in order to help capital flow to carbon-intensive developing economies, which cannot yet reach global or European standards and which need capital to transition to a sustainable future, and quickly.
Principles for taxonomies
A BIS paper
opens in a new tab
 entitled “a taxonomy of sustainable finance taxonomies” develops a framework to classify and compare existing taxonomies. Several weaknesses emerge from this classification and comparison, it says, including the lack of usage of relevant and measurable sustainability performance indicators, lack of granularity and lack of verification of achieved sustainability benefits. The paper therefore proposes key principles for the design of effective taxonomies:
Taxonomies should correspond to specific sustainability objectives
The development of transition taxonomies, which focus on alignment with the objectives of the Paris Agreement, should be encouraged
The evolution of certification and verification processes should be monitored and supervised
There should be a shift to mandatory impact reporting for green bonds
Given global concerns about the diverse range of sustainability standards, standard setters are joining forces to strive for consistency in corporate reporting. The IFRS Foundation Trustees are establishing
opens in a new tab
 the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) which will propose financial and non-financial reporting standards related to climate change. In addition, the Carbon Disclosure Project (CPD), Climate Disclosure Standards Board (CDSB), Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), US Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC) and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) are working together
opens in a new tab
. 
A definition of what and how to measure it?           
A fundamental difference between existing taxonomies is whether they cover climate change, environmental risks more widely or the full set of environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors. The UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the recommendations of the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the US SASB framework all focus on different aspects. They are also a mix of definitions, metrics and reporting standards, as are the various industry initiatives, including the WEF metrics
opens in a new tab
 and the UK Climate Financial Risk Forum's guides
opens in a new tab
. And some jurisdictions, such as the UK, are indicating that they intend to write their own taxonomies.
The highly charged debate in the EU about how to define environmentally sustainable activities demonstrates how difficult it will be to deliver common global standards. The Taxonomy Regulation covers six environmental objectives, but detailed technical screening criteria have so far only been issued for the first two — climate change mitigation and adaptation — and debate continues about key sectors such as nuclear energy and agriculture. However, the Commission estimates that the rules issued so far cover 40% of EU-domiciled listed companies, in sectors which are responsible for almost 80% of direct greenhouse gas emissions in Europe. 
In order for financial firms and institutional investors to measure their ESG exposures, they need data from the companies and projects they fund, insure or invest in, including other financial firms and products. Without mandatory and consistent definitions, metrics and reporting, it is difficult for firms to obtain the data they need, let alone verify their accuracy. 
Listed corporates are responding by improving their ESG reporting and credentials. Around the globe, the TCFD recommendations are being incorporated into corporate reporting requirements, but there are still many data gaps, a lack of consistency and differences across asset types. For the latest on reporting and disclosures, see our separate article.    
What is material?
The EU Taxonomy Regulation enshrines a “double materiality” concept, which requires consideration of how an activity is helping to meet one or more of the objectives and that it does no significant harm (“DNSH”) to the other objectives. Firms must look in two directions and must also decide whether any indicator or data point is material. This construct feeds through to consideration of principal adverse impacts (“PAIs”) in the EU Sustainable Finance Disclosures Regulation (SFDR), which impacts investors and their intermediaries (the buy-side). It has significant ramifications for data needs and operations. 
Within international discussions on corporate reporting, the IFRS Foundation has said the ISSB's work will be based on the existing and long-developed IFRS concept of materiality and will not adopt the EU's double materiality concept. Simply put, corporate reporting standards are concerned about a company's own financial health and risks to it, not about what impact the firm is having on the planet. The Foundation has said, however, that the ISSB's standards will not preclude the EU from adhering to the double materiality concept within the bloc, or preclude similar concepts being adopted elsewhere.
Don't forget good governance
The EU Taxonomy Regulation says that even if an activity supports at least one of the environmental objectives and does no significant harm to any of the others, it cannot be classified as environmentally sustainable unless the company also follows good governance principles (the same holds for socially-sustainable activities). In other words, the EU framework is not E and S and G, but EG and SG. 
In addition to further technical screening criteria to come on the sectors mentioned above and the other four environmental objectives, the EU is working on a social taxonomy and may provide further articulation of what good governance looks like.

European Union Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM)

According to the United Nations, as of June 2023 there are 195 signatories to the Paris Agreement to limit their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.1 However, the Paris Agreement permits countries to set their own ambitions within certain parameters. Some jurisdictions or regions have undertaken to cut carbon emissions faster than others.

From Paris Agreement to CBAM Regulation

As a front-runner in climate protection and a driver of the global environmental agenda, Europe aims to become the world’s first climate-neutral continent by 2050. The European Green Deal, introduced in 2019 and adopted in 2020, is a roadmap of tax and non-tax policy initiatives designed to achieve this ambitious target2. In September 2020, the EU announced its ambition to cut emissions by 2030 by 55 percent in comparison with 1990 levels.3 To meet this target, a series of legislative proposals designed to facilitate the necessary acceleration of GHG emissions reduction by 2030 and align the EU’s climate, transport, land use, energy and taxation policies with this milestone target, was adopted by the European Commission in July 2021 under the ""Fit for 55 package"" banner4.

CBAM as part of the European Green Deal and ""Fit for 55""

One component of the Fit for 55 package is the revision of the EU’s current Emissions Trading System (ETS), which, amongst other changes, includes expanding the scope to include new sectors, reducing the overall quantity of allowances (annual cap) and phasing out the annual allocation of free allowances. While encouraging industrial decarbonization, this revision simultaneously drives carbon prices upwards. Such an increase in emissions pricing risks carbon leakage, which would occur if consumers switched from buying EU-produced goods to purchasing substitutes from non-EU countries that have lower emission reduction requirements where a lesser (or no) carbon price is levied, or firms shifted production activities from the EU to these countries in order to save costs that are inevitably incurred when switching to greener production.
While the EU is implementing measures to achieve climate neutrality and is already successfully reducing GHG emissions, it recognizes that many other countries have not yet made reductions or are increasing emissions. The EU, therefore, hopes to both exert global influence on combatting climate change and address potential carbon leakage concerns through the implementation of a CBAM, which was first proposed in 2019 within the EU Green Deal and is an essential element to the Fit for 55 package.
The Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism Regulation, which entered into force on 17 May 2023 and will come into effect on 1 October 2023, is, therefore, designed to counter the risk of carbon leakage and operates by imposing a charge on the embedded carbon content of certain imports that is equal to the charge imposed on domestic goods under the ETS, with adjustments being made to this charge to take into account any mandatory carbon prices in the exporting country. To ensure that there is no double benefit afforded to EU producers, the CBAM will replace the free ETS allowances currently granted to EU producers assessed to be at high risk of carbon leakage. Therefore, by imposing an equivalent carbon price on the imports of covered goods, the playing field is leveled for both EU producers and EU importers of such goods as partner countries are encouraged to decarbonize their production processes.

Affected products

The new rules will initially affect goods imported from non-EU countries that are particularly carbon-intensive, namely specified goods within the cement, electricity, fertilisers, aluminium, iron, steel and hydrogen sectors, as well as some upstream and downstream products (mainly iron, steel and aluminium). 
CBAM covers imports of covered goods from non-EU countries, except those participating in, or which are linked to, the EU ETS (currently Iceland, Norway, Liechtenstein, Switzerland and five other minor territories).
After implementation of the CBAM, the EU Commission plans to extend the scope of application to all sectors subject to EU emissions trading by 2030.

CBAM implementation to start with reporting obligation in October 2023

In the transitional phase of the implementation of the CBAM, from 1 October 2023 to 31 December 2025, affected companies are subject to a reporting obligation without financial obligations. During this period, importers must determine and document direct and indirect emissions that occur in the course of the production process of the imported goods. This step alone is likely to pose challenges for many companies, as necessary IT solutions for recording and determining carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emissions are often lacking. In addition, affected EU importers are obliged to prepare a quarterly CBAM report that provides information on the imported quantity of CBAM goods, the direct and indirect embedded emissions contained therein (reporting on indirect embedded emissions is initially only for cement, electric power and fertiliser) as well as any carbon taxes effectively paid in the country of production.

Mandatory registration

As of 1 January 2026, only registered declarants will be allowed to import CBAM goods. The customs authorities of the EU member states are obliged to monitor the movement of goods and to deny the import of CBAM goods by non-registered declarants. Importers who are subject to this registration obligation may apply for authorization from 1 January 2025.

Certificate trading

With the start of certificate trading from 1 January 2026, importers are obliged to purchase sufficient emission allowances for imported embedded emissions during the year. Within the framework of an annual CBAM declaration, the amount of imported embedded emissions will be compared with the acquired emission allowances. If too few certificates have been acquired, financial sanctions may be imposed.
The requirements at a glance:  
Determination of direct and indirect CO2e emissions contained in imported CBAM goods based on actual or default (electricity only) values.
If actual values are used: verification and testing by a certified testing body
Acquisition of CBAM certificates for imported CO2e emissions from the relevant CBAM competent authority
Preparation and submission of an annual CBAM declaration for the CBAM goods imported in the previous calendar year and the associated CO2e emissions (deadline for submission: 31 May of the following year), including comparison of the imported CO2e emissions with the emission allowances acquired during the year and to be released
Gradual introduction of the CBAM:

What does the CBAM mean for business?

What companies need to do now:

Businesses should already start preparing to adapt to the upcoming changes that are almost upon us. Amongst the most urgent for EU companies to align themselves with the CBAM regulation is the adherence to reporting obligations from 1 October 2023. For businesses to achieve a smooth roll-over in the upcoming transition period and minimize the disruption to their business model and costs, all EU importers of initial covered products must be ready for these transitional period reporting obligations.
Many EU-based corporates will be monitoring the emissions performance of their supply chain to meet the monitoring, verification and reporting standards now expected of most corporate entities. However, few companies will know in what country the actual emissions, relating to the development of their goods, were generated in. Companies that consume products covered within the scope of the EU ETS, (e.g., manufacturing) could face significant additional cost pass-through from existing suppliers if the CBAM is implemented, due to the significant emissions occurring in geographies without commensurate low carbon policies and the emissions associated with transport of the goods to the EU. Corporates should ensure that they understand the geographical composition of their emissions to enable them to undertake a supply chain review, where required, making conscious cost versus carbon trade-offs and ensuring the resilience of their pricing model to the proposed changes.
As more products fall into the scope of the expanded execution of CBAM, more and more businesses will need to prepare for its implementation. It is critical for companies and importers of CBAM goods in the EU to remain well-informed of these developments and begin evaluating the overall impact on their business activity, which may not be limited to a view on their customs data only, but also impact their sourcing and supply chain.
What companies need to do from 2026/2027 onwards:

ECB Office Blog on credit risk supervision: Q1 2023
The European Central Bank’s (ECB) supervisory expectations in the crucial area of credit risks have continued to evolve rapidly this year. In this blog, I share my thoughts on the likely pressure points for credit risk supervision that banks will face this year.

Credit risk continues to be a central priority for the ECB, which is now accentuated by the banking sector turmoil and concerns over possible credit tightening

In my article on credit risk in November 2022, I discussed the ECB’s growing concerns about the potential impact of macroeconomic and geopolitical turmoil on credit risk. Since then, the ECB has revised its priorities for 2023 to 2025
opens in a new tab
 to account for these new and emerging risks. The turmoil in the banking sector in recent weeks has now accentuated the challenges ahead, reinforcing the relevance of these priorities.
Although the ECB
opens in a new tab
 remains confident that the risk of contagion from the events in the United States and Switzerland to European Union (EU) banks is minimal, this has brought great uncertainties to the market. This is likely to raise the level of concerns for risks already identified by the ECB
opens in a new tab
 as highly relevant and persistent. We therefore expect supervisors to continue closely monitoring not only interest rate risk in the banking book, as well as funding and liquidity risk but also credit risk. As Andrea Enria
opens in a new tab
 has recently mentioned, the response to the current developments confirm that strong, demanding supervision is needed more than ever.
With this in mind, credit risk remains a key area of focus for supervisors, along with funding risks, governance (including risk data aggregation and reporting), digitalisation and climate change. The strategic objectives also make it clear that the ECB expects banks to rapidly close any remaining shortfalls in the management of credit risk:

""Banks should effectively remedy structural deficiencies in their credit risk management cycle, from loan origination to risk mitigation and monitoring, and address in a timely manner any deviations from regulatory requirements and supervisory expectations.""
Source: ECB Banking Supervision, 2022

The ECB reiterated its concerns over credit risk deficiencies. with increasing requirements for banks to address persistent expectations gaps

To understand the ECB thinking on credit risk in greater detail, it is important to look back at the results of 2022’s supervisory activities and the areas identified as presenting the greatest expectation gaps.
On 8 February 2023, the ECB published aggregated results of its Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP) cycle for 2022 for directly supervised banks. This summarises the main deficiencies identified last year across all supervisory activities, and the remedial actions the ECB expects banks to undertake to address those weaknesses. Despite finding that banks have solid capital and liquidity positions, the ECB reiterated its concerns over some significant and persistent credit risk deficiencies. Identified areas of risk included:
Inadequacies in risk management frameworks
Failures to meet its expectations on leveraged transactions [detailed in the March 2022 Dear CEO letter (PDF 407 KB) and 2020’s Guidance (PDF 255 KB)]
Non-performing exposures (NPE) management and provisioning (which I further discuss in my blog on NPLs)
To put this into numbers, nearly one in five of all deficiencies identified in 2022’s SREP related to credit risks. Of these, 44 percent represented shortcomings in banks’ credit risk management frameworks. An additional third related to non-performing exposures (NPEs), including lower than expected coverage and gaps in strategic and operational plans to tackle NPEs and reporting. Another 10 percent related to overall loan classification and provisioning. Leveraged transactions represented only 3 percent of findings, but while this topic is irrelevant for many banks it is viewed as a significant risk for a minority.
In addition to these deficiencies, it is worth noting that climate and environmental (C&E) credit risks received significant attention last year and are expected to become an increasing focus of supervisory activity.
In short, while the ECB’s objectives remain largely unchanged, the way the supervisor is rolling out its work programme has evolved significantly. After the pandemic years, which involved a lot of supervisory firefighting and required banks to implement a wide range of counter-cyclical measures, banks are now facing a more sustained set of geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainties — with the potential for compounding effects on some borrowers’ risk profiles. For the ECB, the need for banks to address their remaining credit risk deficiencies is now a pressing issue.

A broad range of supervisory activities on credit risk are planned for 2023 and beyond

So, what can banks expect from the ECB this year? The supervisor’s action plan for credit risk covers a number of areas and could put banks under significant pressure.
First, the ECB is planning targeted reviews to assess banks’ implementation of the European Banking Authority (EBA) guidelines on loan origination and monitoring. While the principles of the guidelines have been assessed via numerous inspections in recent years, this has been largely fragmented. There is now willingness from the ECB to ensure the entire guidelines are implemented from end to end, in line with the set timeline. The ECB will also put a particular focus this year on residential real estate portfolios, partially echoing the approach to commercial real estate lending in recent years.
Another important area of focus is on forbearance and unlikely to pay (UTP) policies, where too many banks are still considered to be falling short of expectations. The ECB is therefore planning deep dives to assess this topic, and activity has already begun. This is also not a new initiative, but increasing urgency placed on the topic means that banks should remediate any findings as soon as possible.
A third key topic is IFRS 9, for which the ECB announced an on-site inspection (OSI) campaign. This is one of just two anticipated campaigns, with the other focusing on BCBS 239. The IFRS 9 campaign seems to be an extension of the inspections programme launched in 2021 for a selection of EU banks. OSIs will focus on large corporate, small- and medium-sized enterprise (SME) and retail portfolios, and on commercial real estate. In our experience these are intensive, time-consuming exercises that will require extensive planning and dedicated internal response teams from the banks.
The ECB has also intimated that it will conduct targeted reviews on specific banks to assess their compliance with the 2020 “Dear CEO letter"" (PDF 256 KB) letter on credit risk, with particular focus on residual issues and modelling aspects. In my view, this is a follow-up to inspections already performed in recent years. Discussions with banks suggest some have already been approached to discuss their progress with remediation.
Finally, we’re seeing supervisory activities around internal model investigations (IMIs) and internal ratings-based (IRB) model changes related to new regulations, including follow-ups on previous findings. Based on the IMIs performed last year, we observe a step up in the complexity and risk-weighted asset (RWA) impacts of these inspections, with the ECB expecting more sophisticated and robust methodologies in line with the new regulatory framework. The ECB has also announced it will conduct targeted joint OSIs/IMIs for material portfolios in selected vulnerable sectors, assessing the adequacy of IRB models, accounting models and credit risk management frameworks.

We expect the ECB to be stricter when progress is considered inadequate

During the press conference on the results of the SREP 2022, Andrea Enria, Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, had a strong message for banks: remediate any weaknesses identified in a timely manner, or face consequences for non-compliance. The current market turbulences can only accentuate this supervisor’s eagerness to keep credit risks under close control. The ECB will use all available tools to pressure banks if it deems progress is too slow, including targeted Pillar 2 capital requirements, enforcement measures or sanctions.
This message is reflected in the tone of credit risk inspections that have already started. Many banks across Europe are telling us of increased pressure to rapidly resolve remaining gaps, which may be challenging given the wide range of simultaneous remediation programmes already underway. In cases where systems need to be changed, long and complex implementations can conflict with the ECB’s short timelines, which can increase the risk of costs being duplicated by a mix of quick fixes and slower change programmes.
In our experience, a piecemeal approach to remediating ECB findings is rarely advisable, other than for critical issues. We usually advise banks to review all their expectation gaps, identifying common links between diverse findings. This can make it easier to develop a comprehensive remediation programme with defined milestones and a clear end-to-end timetable — helping to facilitate communication and a positive supervisory assessment.

https://kpmg.com/xx/en/our-insights/ecb-office/dora-the-picture-is-becoming-clearer.html,Our Insights,DORA – The picture is becoming clearer,,"July 2023
The Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA), establishing the EU’s new regulatory framework for the management of digital risks in financial markets, entered into force in January 2023 and must be applied from 17 January 2025.
DORA aims to address increasing threats from cyberattacks1 and the rising dependence of the financial industry on digital technology2. It does so by creating a new holistic regulatory framework for digital and operational resilience, harmonising the EU’s current patchwork of financial regulations on information and communication technologies (ICT).
The scope of DORA is exceptionally broad. It covers banks, insurers and investment firms, but also payments, exchanges, market infrastructure, ratings agencies and other financial entities. In addition, it brings ICT Third Party Providers (ICT TPPs), such as cloud vendors, under the direct oversight of financial supervisors for the first time.
DORA will require many firms to make structural and strategic changes such as:
Assigning the ultimate responsibility and accountability for digital operational resilience to the management body
Defining strategies for digital operational resilience and for the use of multiple ICT Third Party Providers (ICT TPPs)
Creating enhanced and harmonised frameworks for ICT risk governance and digital resilience and for the management of ICT TPPs
Assigning the responsibility for managing and overseeing ICT risk to a control function in the 2nd Line of Defence
Changes like these will call for effective coordination between departments, making strong senior leadership and a supportive culture vital to ensure consistency across the organisation.
The detailed implications of DORA are becoming increasingly clear, with the first major policy package launched for public consultation on 19 June 2023. It comprises the following four draft regulatory technical standards (RTS) and one set of draft implementing technical standards (ITS):
A draft RTS on ICT risk management framework and a draft RTS on simplified ICT risk management framework
A draft RTS on criteria for the classification of ICT-related incidents
A draft ITS to establish the templates for the register of information
A draft RTS to specify the policy on ICT services supporting critical or important functions performed by ICT TPPs
This package was developed by the Joint Committee of the European Supervisory Authorities (EBA, EIOPA and ESMA – the ESAs). It builds on existing European and international standards, which should give many financial entities a head start on implementation.

These draft technical standards have implications on the following DORA pillars:

1. ICT risk management
The draft RTS add colour to some of the requirements already identified in the DORA Chapter II, Section II. Instead of defining a complete ICT risk management framework, it provides more detailed information on some aspects in the areas of protection, prevention, detection, and response than those covered in the existing ESAs Guidelines. This gives financial entities a good idea of the adaptations they will need to make to the current frameworks. Only smaller financial entities can benefit from a simplified ICT risk management framework.
2. ICT-related incident reporting
The draft RTS propose criteria for classifying ICT-related incidents as well as a classification approach and materiality thresholds for determining major ICT-related incidents and significant cyber threats. To aid comparability, the draft RTS aim to make DORA’s new requirements as consistent as possible with existing incident reporting frameworks such as those of the Network and Information Security Directive 2 (NIS2) and the Payment Services Directive 2 (PSD2). That should help financial institutions to minimize adaptations to their existing ICT-related incident reporting.
3. ICT third party risk management
The draft ITS establish templates for the register of information, covering all contractual arrangements with ICT TPPs at individual, consolidated and sub-consolidated levels. Compared to the outsourcing guidelines from the ESA's, extended information requirements are required. This is likely to lead to some effort on the part of banks and other financial entities.
The draft RTS specify the content of the policy regarding the life cycle management of third-party arrangements for the use ICT services supporting critical or important functions. It was developed with an eye to existing outsourcing guidelines from the ESA's. This should help financial institutions that have already implemented existing guidelines to make the required changes.

What now?

DORA will make digital resilience a board-level priority. Senior executives need to respond with strong leadership and a strategic approach to digital resilience. True, the new rules follow a risk-based approach and will be applied proportionately. However, only the smallest firms will benefit from formal reductions in scope.
Firms should act now to begin analysing the necessary changes to their risk management activities.

Key priorities are likely to include:

Adapting implementation plans that take the recently published policy package – and other upcoming technical standards – into account.
Ensuring that ICT risk management framework fulfills requirements regarding policies, procedures, protocols and tools.
Verifying that the incident reporting processes meet the required classification approach and materiality thresholds.
Identifying responsibilities and reporting processes and set up appropriate data quality controls to meet the requirements of the register of information.
Verifying whether a policy for managing contractual arrangements with ICT TPPs that support critical or important functions is in place, and whether it covers all phases of the life cycle.
Banks should also respond to the public consultation on the RTS and ITS (open until 11 September 2023), for example by commenting on the simplicity, clarity and proportionality of requirements. DORA represents a major change to European financial regulation; active engagement is critical.

Integrating climate and environmental factors into loan pricing is a complex and far-reaching challenge for European banks. It goes to the heart of their business – balance sheet management. There is much to do, and little time. This article introduces the key implications for banks, and some suggested steps to tackle this challenge.
European banks need to integrate climate-related and environmental (C&E) factors into their loan pricing by the end of 2023,and to meet all the European Central Bank’s (ECB) C&E expectations by the end of 20241. This requires a whole-bank, top to bottom transformation. Specifically, the ECB2 expects banks’ loan pricing frameworks to reflect their credit risk appetite and business strategy for C&E risks, and for loan pricing components to be C&E sensitive.
Time therefore is short, and many European banks still have a long way to go. In the first half of 20223, more than 40 percent of Significant Institutions (SIs) and Less Significant Institutions (LSIs) still had taken no action to implement C&E risks into loan pricing (see Figure 1). A recent KPMG survey on ESG risk in May 20234 shows that while further banks are envisioning to work on this topic, some do not have any plans in place yet.

Note: The figure shows the level of maturity of banks’ of integrating C&E aspects in loan pricing, covering 107 significant banks under the direct supervision of the ECB and 79 less significant banks supervised by their national authorities.
The new requirements for integrating C&E in loan pricing are drawn from the EBA’s Guidelines on loan origination and monitoring5 and the EBA report on the management and supervision of ESG risks6. The ECB also identifies C&E risks as a key supervisory priority7. This is in line with the EU’s policy focus on its Fit-for-55 green finance package8, which aims to reduce EU emissions substantially by 2030, while being mindful of the resilience and capacity of the financial system required to achieve this goal, as ‘green’ does not necessarily mean less risk9. Investment, including C&E-sensitive lending, will play a crucial role in achieving this goal.

So, what do banks need to do?
Loan pricing framework and banking strategy
Banks’ business strategy and risk strategy need to be updated in line with banks’ C&E vision (e.g., each bank’s targets on reducing financed emissions and increasing green finance)10 that reflects banks’ impact and risk-driven motivations11. These C&E-related updates need to then be integrated in loan pricing frameworks12. In fact, C&E-risk-sensitive differentiation in loan pricing is a tool that banks can use to operationalise their C&E vision - and align their portfolio composition accordingly13 (see Figure 2). The challenge for banks is to commensurately reflect this impact and risk-driven motivations in loan pricing frameworks, since adopting solely an impact-based malus/bonus approach may be dangerous from a risk point of view.

Note: Banks have various tools to operationalise the integration of C&E considerations outlined in their business strategy and risk strategy. C&E-differentiated loan pricing is one of these tools.

With that in mind, it’s also essential for banks to consider their competitive environment. Business units have discretion to alter the margin component of loan pricing in response to market conditions. To remain competitive, some business units are offering financing to 'green' borrowers or specific 'green' assets at a discount. Some may also charge a premium to ‘brown’ companies or when financing ‘brown’ assets.
However, in the process of growing their green market share or reducing their financed emissions, C&E differential pricing – if not done properly - could lead banks to take on excessive through-the-cycle risks, or ceding market share to competitors still willing to finance companies making a slow (or no) transition from ‘brown’ to ‘green’. Therefore, it is essential to get loan pricing right – allowing banks to build market share without compromising their long-term profitability.
Finally, the interest rate environment needs to be considered. In recent years, low interest rates and fierce competition left banks with little room for price differentiation, but the current higher interest rate gives more scope for banks to adjust their loan pricing – presenting an opportunity not seen in a decade.
Loan pricing components
To explore how to reflect the different cost impacts of C&E risks into loan pricing as expected by the ECB14, it is important to look closely at the margin and costs components of the interest rate of a bank loan (see schematic illustration in the Figure 3). Each component poses its own challenges when it comes to integrating C&E factors.

Note: Simplified, client’s interest rate includes Margin and Costs components, whereas Costs can be further differentiated between Credit risk costs, Capital costs, Funding costs and other (e.g. administrative) costs.
Profit margin is the component which most institutions with differentiated loan pricing frameworks focus on, by providing tailored pricing for green loans (which ring-fence loan proceeds for environmental objectives) or sustainability-linked loans (which typically offer reduced interest charges to borrowers that achieve specified sustainability-related or transition-related targets) (see Figure 4). Also, the offering of products such as sustainability-linked loans may reflect lower funding costs that result from a funding advantage passed through to green assets linked to a green funding source.

Note: The figure illustrates the mechanism of a sustainability-linked loan with a client receiving a more beneficial loan interest rate when achieving predefined green targets (e.g., GHG emissions reduction rate is above predefined threshold). When the green target is not achieved, the interest rate returns to the basic level.

Funding costs need to reflect the cost of liabilities, such as deposits, issued stocks and bonds, and interbank borrowing. Banks’ Funds Transfer Pricing (FTP) frameworks typically quantify funding costs based on estimates of liquidity risk and interest rate risk. However, as banks make greater use of green deposits and sustainability-linked liabilities to fund green and sustainability-linked loans, FTP frameworks will need amending to introduce new ‘green pricing curves’ that reflect the benefit of funding green asset with green liabilities (see Figure 5). This shall lead to a reduction in the funding cost component in the loan pricing (see Figure 3).

Note: Banks may introduce new green pricing curves, that, in terms of spread levels, may tend more towards existing unsecured or secured curves. Source: KPMG International, 2023
Credit and capital costs need to reflect a range of novel C&E risks. Banks use various performance metrics in loan pricing, such as return on equity (ROE), risk adjusted return on equity (RAROE) and risk adjusted return on risk adjusted capital (RARORAC). These metrics typically incorporate credit risk and capital-related elements, such as:
IFRS 9 expected credit losses15 (ECL) and CRR expected losses (EL) in the context of credit risk costs; and
Economic Capital (ECap) and risk-weighted assets (RWA)-based estimations in the context of capital costs16
The main challenges for integrating C&E risks in these elements via Probability of Default (PD) and Loss Given Default (LGD) are twofold. First, banks need to develop an approach to integrate C&E risk measurement into conventional risk differentiation, while considering different time horizons (e.g., rating horizon versus IFRS 9 lifetime horizon). Second, banks need to overcome the C&E data challenge. Ultimately, banks need to ensure that models and processes adequately reflect C&E risks in a way that avoids under or overpricing loans.

Next steps
Given the EU’s ambition for achieving its Fit-for-55 vision by 2030, we expect supervisors to continue their high intensity focus on climate-related risks over the next 2 to 3 years – gradually widening to include other environmental factors such as natural capital17.
Banks face a significant challenge to integrate C&E risks into their loan pricing frameworks in a robust and reliable manner that increases transparency of lending decisions. Many banks still have a lot of work to do to comply with the mounting pressure from supervisors and other stakeholders.
While considering the progress they have already made, banks should consider creating a roadmap for fully integrating C&E factors into loan pricing. This can be used internally, and in consultation with supervisors, to plan, monitor, and communicate their progress. In KPMG professionals’ view, a high-level roadmap should reflect the following key priorities for banks:
Align pricing with strategy: Ensure that loan pricing is advancing the bank’s business and risk strategies, helping it to achieve its C&E targets.
Pursue holistic integration: Integrate C&E factors into all cost elements of loan pricing (capital, credit, funding costs), not just the margin component. Moreover, C&E integration into loan pricing should also take place in conjunction with other bank-wide C&E initiatives, while addressing ECB expectations and relevant regulations. Considering the efforts this requires , some banks start the integration of C&E risks in loan pricing for selected portfolios only, with aim of expanding at a later stage to further C&E-material portfolios.
 Involve stakeholders (internal parties): Engage all relevant teams and functions in planning and implementation. One key group – including (credit) risk management and modelling, treasury, legal, finance and IT – needs to redefine the pricing framework and its controls, processes, and data. The second group – business units and relationship managers – needs to change their day-to-day loan pricing operations to incorporate C&E risks. A joined-up and holistic approach is vital to ensue that C&E risks are assessed appropriately while avoiding double counting.
Achieving the correct pricing of C&E risks can provides tremendous opportunities for early movers in the market, particularly in the current environment of evolving risk management standards and also benefiting from the highest interest rates in more than a decade. Moreover, by getting pricing C&E risks adequately, banks can establish themselves as a reliable partner and financial advisor for clients on their low-carbon transition journey. On the other hand, the late movers shall meanwhile take on comparable C&E-risky business at inappropriate prices - due to adverse selection. It is therefore essential to clearly understand the potential broader implications for the bank when defining the timing of the roadmap to implement.

https://kpmg.com/xx/en/our-insights/gms-flash-alert/flash-alert-2024-181.html,,,,"Starting 1 September 2024, the modified “Finnish Aliens Act”1 has introduced stricter rules for obtaining a Finnish residence permit.  The changes aim to prevent abuse, foster stricter identity verification, and consider dishonest conduct when issuing permits.  The rules apply also to applications submitted before 1 September that are still pending.

WHY THIS MATTERS
The Finnish authorities have implemented new regulations and heightened scrutiny for residence permit applications, requiring foreign nationals to exercise greater vigilance and precision when applying. It is crucial that applicants carefully follow the applicable rules, as their history and conduct in Finland will carry significant weight in the decision process. Additionally, it is important to comply with regulations concerning applications made from outside Finland to avoid rejection. Foreign nationals and their representatives may need to revise their policies and procedures to align with these new rules, ensuring compliance and reducing the risk of application denial.

Key Changes Explained

Starting 1 September 2024, the Finnish Immigration Service (Maahanmuuttovirasto) can issue a negative residence permit decision if:
1. A first residence permit has been submitted from within Finland: An application for a first residence permit must usually be submitted outside Finland. Once the legislative amendments have entered into force, stricter scrutiny will be applied for those first residence permit applications that have been submitted in Finland.  A negative residence permit decision can be received if a first residence permit is applied for in Finland.2
Exceptions: Persons can apply within Finland if they are a family member of a Finnish citizen, a child born in Finland, or if they are applying for studies or research (or as a family member of a student or researcher).
Each application is reviewed individually, considering all relevant factors and circumstances. The decision will evaluate whether rejecting the application is unreasonable and if there are any legal, migration management, or internal security concerns that could prevent issuing of the permit. 
2.     A residence permit is applied for without the applicant having a passport issued by their country of nationality: A valid passport from the country of nationality is mandatory.3   If applicants only have a refugee travel document or an alien’s passport, they won't be eligible for a residence permit. 
Exceptions: Some exceptions to the passport requirement exist for specific cases, such as children born in Finland, victims of human trafficking, those needing humanitarian protection, or individuals who have previously received protection without a passport. 
3.     An appropriate code of conduct is not followed: Applicants’ own actions will be considered when examining their applications.  Examples of a person’s own actions include the following:
They have given the authorities false information about their identity or nationality or the true purpose of his/her stay in Finland, for example.
They have presented forged documents.
They have resided in Finland illegally.
They have knowingly worked in Finland illegally, that is without having the right to work.
They have submitted a manifestly unfounded application so that they would not have to leave the country.
They have tried to mislead the authorities in some other way.
4.     An extension is applied for after the previous permit has expired: An extension application may get a negative decision if the extension permit application is not submitted before the expiry of the current residence permit.
Starting 1 September 2024, changes to the Aliens Act will affect asylum seekers in Finland: 
Restrictions on residence permits: Asylum seekers cannot obtain a residence permit based on studies, employment, or pursuing a trade if they have a pending or negative asylum decision.4 This applies regardless of when the asylum application was submitted.  Applications for first residence permits on these grounds will be deemed inadmissible if submitted within Finland. Applicants must apply from their home country or country of permanent residence. 
Asylum seekers work rights: Asylum seekers’ right to work will end if they receive a negative asylum decision starting 1 September 2024, but they can continue to work during the appeal period and until the administrative court's decision is served. If the court returns the case to the Immigration Service, the right to work may continue, depending on the specifics of the case. 
Voluntary return: A permit may be denied if a return to Finland occurs within five years of receiving voluntary return assistance.
A new border procedure5 related to asylum applications has entered into force.

KPMG Insights
Navigating the process of obtaining a residence permit can be complex and challenging. 
It’s more important than ever for individuals to apply for their first residence permit from outside Finland whenever possible.  Following these new guidelines may reduce the risk of rejection and may foster the smooth processing of the application in accordance with standard procedures, which may enhance the chances of a successful outcome.
The KPMG International member firm in Finland will continue to monitor the legislative changes and will endeavour to inform readers of GMS Flash Alert of any important developments.

https://kpmg.com/xx/en/our-insights/regulatory-insights/fca-consumer-duty-and-wholesale-firms.html,Regulatory Insights,FCA Consumer Duty and Wholesale Firms,,"The FCA Consumer Duty is coming into force in July 2023. It represents a 'paradigm shift' in the FCA's expectations of firms, increasing the current level of consumer protection in the retail financial services markets. At first glance, it seems that wholesale firms, such as banks, wholesale brokers, securities services firms or alternative asset managers, that do not interact directly with retail consumers may not need to take any action. However, through various updates the FCA is signalling that wholesale firms do need to review the requirements and reach a conclusion to validate the degree to which Consumer Duty will apply to their suite of products or services.

Consumer Duty — a summary

The Consumer Duty introduces a new FCA Principle for firms — that a firm must act to deliver good outcomes for retail customers. Underneath the principle there are three overarching cross cutting rules — a firm must:
Act in good faith towards customers
Avoid foreseeable harm to customers
Enable and support customers to pursue their financial objectives
And then there are four outcomes which represent the key elements of the firm-customer relationship where firms will need to capture specific, granular evidence they are delivering good outcomes:
Products and services
Price and value
Consumer understanding
Consumer support

Suggested considerations and actions for wholesale firms

Do we have retail customers?
The first step is for wholesale firms to review whether they actually have a direct relationship with any retail customers. As part of MiFID II implementation — firms are likely to have had to classify all their clients into retail, professional and eligible counterparty. A check should be done on systems to see whether there are retail clients in the parts of business units or entities that deliver wholesale activities. If firms are not confident that their systems are accurate, they will need to consider other ways of finding out this information. Firms will also need to review their classification process and re-validate that customers who were opted out of retail classification were classified this way for appropriate reasons — i.e. that the professional category does not contain hidden retail customers that shouldn't have been opted up in the first place.
If retail customers are found, the requirements contained within Consumer Duty will apply. While considering their clients' best interests, firms may wish to evaluate whether the business gained from what may be a very small population of retail customers is worth the effort and resources (both initially and ongoing) that will be needed to align with Consumer Duty.
Do we manufacture products that are sold to retail clients?
In its finalised guidance
opens in a new tab
 (PDF 1.13 MB) the FCA has said that 'the Duty applies to firms that have a material influence over, or determine, retail customer outcomes. For example, it applies to firms that can influence material aspects of or determine the design or operation of retail products or services, including their price and value'.
Therefore, even if the firm does not deal directly with retail customers they may be caught by the 'look through' obligation. With this guidance, wholesale firms that manufacture regulated products and services that are then distributed by other firms to retail clients will need to be compliant with consumer duty. For each of the outcomes above, there is the expectation that:
Firms should assess their client base and the full range of services provided
If there is any ambiguity on whether a firm is materially influencing retail customer outcomes, it should document its view and its rationale
Firms review their current approaches to bring them in line with the Consumer Duty expectations
Firms determine a target market and establish what a good outcome is for all key points with each product lifecycle and customer journey
Firms embed consideration of characteristics of vulnerability within all aspects of the Consumer Duty
Ultimately, firms can ensure they can evidence good outcomes in product/service design and operation, pricing and value, customer understanding and customer support
Outcomes are reviewed and monitored on an ongoing basis
Any issues identified are remedied or mitigated and root cause analysis addresses reoccurring issues
The FCA has confirmed
opens in a new tab
 (PDF 202 KB) that high net worth and sophisticated clients are still retail clients and could be captured by the Duty.
How are we complying with the scope of the requirements?
Reassuringly, the FCA recognises the concept of proportionality in the application of Consumer Duty. This is proportionality in the sense of the level of involvement and influence in the distribution chain, the greater involvement or influence — the more firms need to do. The FCA also considers the level of risk the product/service exposes the retail clients to. So firms manufacturing higher risk products will require more efforts to satisfy the requirements. The FCA made it clear in its Policy Statement
opens in a new tab
 (PDF 1.3 MB) on the Duty that if firms comply with existing PROD rules, which are the FCA's handbook rules that implement MiFID II product governance rules, then those firms would comply with the FCA's expectations on the products and services outcome under the Consumer Duty. However, the scope of Consumer Duty is broader than the scope of products referred to in PROD, therefore if firms manufacture services as well as products they will need to consider the specific circumstances and their compliance.
On the price and value outcome, this may not be totally in the manufacturer's control, but they are likely to have some input. Firms will need to review the FCA's expectations for this outcome, possibly in conjunction with the distributor or co-manufacturers.
The FCA has emphasised that the Consumer Duty is an outcomes-based regulation — so key to firms' compliance will be their ability to measure and evidence consumer outcomes. For manufacturers, importantly this will partly derive from requesting information from distributors. Industry agreed solutions, such as common templates, are developing in the market to meet the expectations of Consumer Duty. However, firms need to consider whether there is sufficient information in these solutions to meet their own risk appetite and culture.
Wholesale firms are likely to have less influence over the consumer understanding or consumer support outcomes. However, they will still need to be considered. For example, if the manufacturer's term sheet or terms and conditions for the product is being sent on directly to the retail consumer, it should review whether it is written in language that a retail consumer could be expected to understand, and whether the firm's contact details are provided.
Are our data or services used to deliver retail products or services?
The FCA has signalled that it is considering Consumer Duty in all its supervisory interactions. For example, in its supervisory portfolio letter
opens in a new tab
 (PDF 215 KB) to Benchmark Administrators, the FCA highlighted that although benchmark administration activities are not within scope of Consumer Duty, it is likely to apply to other firms in the distribution chain of products in which benchmarks are used. Therefore, the FCA expects benchmark administrators to support users of their benchmarks in meeting their obligations under the Duty. It is not completely clear what this means in practice, but it is clear there will be indirect implications where these firms' clients have their own obligations.
Using this example, firms that use benchmarks in products that are delivered to retail clients will need to evidence that their products are delivering fair outcomes to retail clients and therefore they need to be comfortable that the benchmark is reliable and fairly representing data. The firm using the benchmark may then ask the benchmark administrator to evidence or to confirm this. Benchmark administrators may find they get asked similar questions from a number of clients.
The FCA has indicated
opens in a new tab
 (PDF 202 KB) that custody and fund services firms may be captured by aspects of the requirements (for example, transfer agency services or depositaries' communications), but also noted that delivering outsourced services to asset managers could result in needing to consider the Consumer Duty.
Firms that know their services, data or products are being used by firms that need to comply with Consumer Duty need to consider how they can respond to similar queries or requests from their clients.
KPMG's UK firm professionals can assist with Consumer Duty and are currently advising clients on the navigation of these requirements, what it may mean for their business and providing implementation support.

https://kpmg.com/xx/en/our-insights/regulatory-insights/comparing-regulatory-proposals-for-esg-ratings.html,Regulatory Insights,Comparing regulatory proposals for ESG ratings,,"ESG ratings providers are facing an increasingly diverse landscape of potential regulation, as regulators in the UK, EU and Asia rapidly develop new measures. In the UK, the International Regulatory Strategy Group (IRSG), a cross-sector group of practitioners from the financial and related professional services industry, has been mandated by the FCA to develop a voluntary code of conduct
opens in a new tab
 for ESG data and ratings providers. At the same time, HM Treasury (HMT) is consulting on a formal regulatory regime. The European Commission has also proposed a formal regime, which could come into force next year. Meanwhile, there are moves in Japan, Singapore and India to develop local requirements.
Current proposals may evolve as they move through the consultative process, and firms should expect iterative updates to plug gaps that emerge. Equivalence is unlikely to be granted until regimes have settled, and some firms may therefore have to grapple with uneven requirements across jurisdictions.

Ethical, independence and transparency requirements

In line with IOSCO's 2021 recommendations, regulators in the UK, EU and Asia have taken similar approaches to ethical and independence issues, and also to methodological transparency.
Regulators across the board agree that users must be able to fully understand the nature of ratings. Therefore, ratings providers should disclose not only the data points considered, but also their weighting in calculations and the time horizon of assessments. The EU proposes that ratings providers should disclose the extent to which data points are science-based.
Both UK and EU proposals require ratings providers to review the relevance and appropriateness of their methodologies on a regular basis. While the IRSG does not specify a minimum frequency, the EU Commission defines 'regular' as on at least an annual basis.
Ratings are expected to appear, and be, independent. At entity level, ratings providers must also ensure that their business activities do not conflict with the ratings that they provide. The EU proposal is the most restrictive in this respect, and would make a wide range of business activities, including banking, investment and insurance services, benchmark development, issuance of credit ratings, consulting and audit activities, incompatible with authorisation to provide ESG ratings. Other proposals are less stringent, encouraging providers to put in place appropriate measures to maintain the independence and objectivity of different arms of their business.

Proportionality

The EU and the IRSG both appear to offer some leeway for proportionate application of requirements. The IRSG's principles-based framework could be more easily flexed to apply to different sized firms, while the EU's rules-based approach has a specific carve-out for small or medium-sized entities, providing they have already implemented measures and procedures which ensure effective compliance with the rules. However, in practice, the EU proposal is likely to be more burdensome for smaller firms who have to make enhancements to their internal control mechanisms and reporting arrangements.

Divergence in scope

The scope of HMT's proposed regime would include data products which contain an element of assessment. The IRSG's voluntary code of conduct goes further, capturing both ESG ratings and ESG data products. This could include firms providing opinions, scores or rankings of the ESG characteristics of a financial instrument, product or company, as well as firms just providing aggregated data to allow a user to assess these ESG characteristics themself. The EU proposal is narrower, only capturing providers of ESG ratings. A 'rating' includes both ESG 'opinions' and ESG 'scores' with both categories requiring application of a rules-based methodology (by a ratings analyst or statistical model) to raw data before the output is brought into scope.

Audit and assurance requirements

Neither the EU or IRSG's proposals would require audit and assurance of the ratings or data provided. However, under existing credit rating regulations in the UK and EU, ratings providers are required to retain audit trails for a minimum of 5 years. The Benchmarks Regulation (applicable in the EU and on-shored in the UK) goes further, requiring an annual internal review of a benchmark's compliance, and external review for some benchmarks on a biannual basis, to ensure user confidence in the outputs. It is feasible that, over time, requirements for ESG data and ratings regimes will expand to include similar measures — firms should therefore consider conducting appropriate internal review and assurance exercises at an early stage.

Data collection issues

The EU would only require ratings providers to ensure they have made a 'thorough analysis' of all the information available to them, whereas the IRSG voluntary code specifies principles which aim to minimise the burden on the companies being rated to produce information to be consumed by ratings firms. At the stage of data collection, ESG ratings firms would be required to prepopulate data templates with publicly available information before requesting further data, inform companies that they are being rated and disclose the rating methodology. Companies would also have the right to draw the ratings firm's attention to errors or omissions that they identify.
Efforts are underway to standardise the presentation of sustainability information required under the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), however potential benefits to ESG ratings providers in terms of availability of data will not be clear until reporting rolls out, beginning in 2024, and may not be fully realised until phasing in of the directive completes in 2029. Moreover, ESG ratings firms in the EU would not be limited to using only the data points required by CSRD, meaning that companies might still need to provide additional information.

UK
30 June 2023 — HMT consultation on formal regulatory regime for ESG ratings providers closed. Timeline for finalisation and application of regime not yet clear. Regime expected to significantly ramp up mandatory requirements.
5 October 2023 — IRSG consultation closes, with the voluntary code of conduct to be finalised at the end of 2023.
EU 1 September 2023 — EU Commission consultation on proposed Regulation closed. The proposal will now be scrutinised by the European Parliament and Council. Once agreed and adopted, it will be approximately six months before the final Regulation enters into force.
Japan
June 2023 — Endorsement of Japanese FSA’s final code of conduct for ESG evaluation and data providers.
June 2024 — Code of conduct for ESG data provision expected.
Singapore
22 August 2023 — MAS’s consultation on a voluntary code of conduct closed. A proposal for a formal regulatory regime should be expected in the future, following the structure of the existing local regime for the provision of credit rating services.
India 11 March 2022 — SEBI’s consultation on a regulatory framework for ESG rating providers in the securities market closed.

KPMG in the UK is well placed to support on a range of activities related to the evolving ESG Data and Ratings regulatory landscape. We have the right blend of financial services risk, regulatory authorisation and financial services legal expertise, allowing us to provide turnkey solutions to regulatory challenges within the ESG Data and Ratings space.

https://kpmg.com/xx/en/our-insights/regulatory-insights/non-financial-regulatory-reporting-a-period-of-change.html,Regulatory Insights,Non-financial regulatory reporting – a period of change,,"Over the last ten years firms operating in wholesale financial markets have had to drastically increase the amount of their non-financial regulatory reporting with the introduction of EMIR and MiFID II/MiFIR. Firms trading in the US have also had to implement similar regulations. Regulators have introduced these requirements with the aim of gaining more transparency on risk within markets, identifying market abuse and increasing trade transparency to aid market efficiency.
In Europe, since 2019, regulatory reporting requirements have been under a period of review with the EMIR REFIT, EU MiFIR review and the UK Wholesale Markets Review.
Some of the amendments resulting from these reviews have now been finalised and firms need to be ready to report using the new requirements in line with various deadlines across 2024.
This is the first of a series of articles looking at the changes that firms need to implement.

Changes to MiFIR/MiFID II transparency requirements

In the EU, the review of MiFIR/MiFID transparency requirements was started by ESMA in 2019. Changes to the requirements contained in legislation (level 1) will not be finalised until the MiFIR Review has been agreed at the end of the trilogues (political) processes. However, the amendments to requirements set out in the delegated regulations or RTS 1
opens in a new tab
 & RTS 2
opens in a new tab
 have been published into the EU Official Journal and firms will need to start implementing ready for go-live in January 2024.
In the UK, the FCA has released Policy Statement 23/4
opens in a new tab
 on improving equity secondary markets — which it consulted upon in July 2022 (CP 22/12). It takes forward some of the changes that were originally proposed as part of HM Treasury's ""Wholesale Market Review"" (WMR) with the aim of tailoring the onshored MiFID II/MiFIR regime for the UK market.

Equity markets transparency

In the EU, changes to RTS 1 include
Applying from 1 January 2024:
Measures to the reduce the non-price forming trade exemptions (to reporting) in RTS1 to be in line with RTS 22 (reporting of transactions to competent authorities)
Further specification on the content of the data requests, and in particular the details to be disclosed by trading venues, APAs and consolidated tape providers when they report reference data and quantitative data to ESMA and competent authorities
Increasing the pre-trade large-in-scale (LIS) thresholds for ETFs from EUR 1,000,000 to EUR 3,000,000
Increasing the minimum qualifying size threshold for deferred publications of ETFs
The introduction of a definition of a hybrid trading system to ensure they are captured under pre-trade transparency requirements
Bringing forward the deferral publication time from noon to 9am of the next trading day
In the UK, changes include:
On pre-trade transparency:
Waivers — allowing UK trading venues to use reference prices from overseas venues, where those prices are robust, reliable and transparent — this will take effect immediately
The FCA will undertake a broader view of the most relevant market in terms of liquidity (MRMTL) calculation once it receives its new powers to operate the pre-trade transparency regime via the Financial Services and Markets Bill
The FCA will also remove size thresholds for orders benefiting from the order management facility (OMF) waiver by allowing trading venues to calibrate them according to the characteristics of their markets — this will take effect immediately
On post-trade transparency from 29 April 2024
Non-price forming trades — modifying and expanding the list of exceptions from post-trade transparency — e.g. inter-fund transfers, expanding the exemption of give-up/give-in transactions, inter-affiliate trades, transactions arising in the context of margin or collateral requirements for the purposes of clearing
Improving the consolidation of trade reports from different source by deleting some flags and introducing some new flags, for example:
Deleting SI-related flags “SIZE”, “ILQD” and “RPRI”
Deleting the agency cross flag “ACTX”, the duplicate trade flag “DUPL”
Aggregating the flags applicable to different types of negotiated trades “NLIQ”, “OILQ” and “PRIC” into single flag “NETW”
The FCA is considering policy options to maintain alignment between trade and transaction reporting
 Changes to formatting conventions of the “Price” and “Price currency” reporting fields and introduction of a new field — `Price conditions'.

Non equity markets transparency

In the EU changes to RTS 2, that will apply from 1 January 2024, include:
Measures to align the reporting of non-price forming transactions between RTS2 and RTS22 (reporting of transactions to competent authorities)
The introduction of a definition of a hybrid trading system to ensure they are captured under pre-trade transparency requirements
Bringing into line with market conventions the reporting of bond and CDS prices
Adding a flag to identify portfolio trades
Further clarification and specification on the post-trade transparency data field and flag requirements
Specifying the format under which certain characteristics of commodity and freight derivatives are reported
In the UK, the FCA is still considering the exact changes to non-equity markets transparency with a consultation paper expected at the end of 2024. Market feedback is that the current transparency regime for fixed income and derivatives markets, which is modelled on the one for equities markets, does not work, so changes proposed could be quite radical.

Designated Reporting

In response to the WMR, there were calls to separate the ability to do post-trade reporting of OTC trades on behalf of clients from the other obligations of being a Systematic Internaliser (SI). Market participants also raised concerns that there is a degree of uncertainty about who should report OTC trades and that the current reporting regime creates operational complexity for firms.
The FCA is adopting a new designated reporting (DR) firms regime where firms will be able to register as designated reporters regardless of whether they are an SI in any instrument. Registration will apply at entity level — but DRs will be able to bilaterally agree for the other party to report the trade if a DR doesn't have the arrangements set up to report a particular type of asset or instrument.
The FCA will announce further details on the registration procedure in due course. The concept of a designated reporting entity has also been introduced in the EU as part of the MiFIR review negotiations.

Implications

Trading venues and investment firms, and data reporting service providers (DRSPs) consolidating trade reports by them, will need to update their systems to comply with the changes to trade transparency, including the changes to the reporting fields and trade flags. This may also impact on systems for transaction reporting.
Alongside these changes, both the UK and EU are addressing the lack of consolidated tapes of market data. Both jurisdictions are now looking to put place frameworks that would enable, for each asset class, a single private sector operated tape, that would be authorised and regulated.
It is clear that these changes will result in a degree of divergence between EU & UK reporting standards. The FCA believes the benefits of the increased quality and clarity of post-trade reporting will outweigh the potential costs arising from the divergence from the EU on this matter. However, firms working in both jurisdictions will need to carefully review the differences when planning implementation. Enforcement actions when firms have not correctly implemented the requirements shows the value regulators place on this reporting.

How can KPMG help?

KPMG in the UK has extensive experience supporting financial services firms on Non-Financial Regulatory Reporting (NFRR) reform and is well placed to help firms assess and implement the proposed changes. This includes advisory services such as post implementation reviews, controls and operating model reviews, assisting firms with implementation of changes to reporting requirements and providing remediation support.

https://kpmg.com/xx/en/our-insights/regulatory-insights/esg-ratings-the-eus-journey-to-regulation-begins.html,Regulatory Insights,ESG ratings — the EU’s journey to regulation begins,,"As the use of ESG data and ratings has grown in financial services, so has regulators' concern around issues such as data quality, transparency of methodologies and conflicts of interest. The European Commission's proposal for a regulation on ESG rating activities is the latest potential regulatory regime to emerge, following not long after the launch of UK HM Treasury's consultation. With two major jurisdictions now seeking to formally regulate ESG ratings, providers, any firms developing and selling ESG scores, opinions and ratings in Europe should start to evaluate how this could impact their business models.

What is the aim of the Commission's proposal?

The proposal aims to enhance the integrity, transparency, governance and independence of ESG ratings provided in the EU. It is broadly aligned to the existing Benchmarks Regime (BMR), reflecting the close relationship between ESG ratings and benchmarks used in the EU. The risk that benchmark administrators may accidentally or carelessly misuse ESG ratings, leading to the miscalculation of a benchmark, is a key regulatory concern.

What's in scope?

The proposal relates to 'ESG ratings'. 
An ESG rating is defined as 'an opinion, a score or a combination of both, regarding an entity, a financial instrument, a financial product, or an undertaking's ESG profile or characteristics or exposure to ESG risks' where:
An 'opinion' is an assessment which directly involves a rating analyst and is derived from a rules-based methodology or ranking system. 
A 'score' is defined similarly, but without the need for the direct involvement of an analyst. 
The scope of the ESG characteristics captured is not limited to climate-related issues, but also includes the impact on people, society and broader environmental issues. Similar to the UK proposal, there is no need for the ESG rating to be explicitly labelled as such — therefore products could inadvertently fall into the scope of the regulation. 
The regime would apply to all ESG ratings provided to EU 'regulated financial undertakings', i.e. regulated financial services providers or funds, with some exceptions for ratings which are developed in-house, by central banks in limited circumstances, or where the rating is not intended to be publicly disclosed or distributed. ESG data which contains no elements of an opinion or score and is not the subject of modelling or analysis before being provided would also be out of scope.

How will the proposed regime be enforced?

EU legal entities which fall into scope will require authorisation by ESMA. ESMA will be responsible for developing the secondary legislation/ Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) which will further clarify the responsibilities of authorised ESG Ratings providers under the new regime. Providers will have to pay supervisory fees to ESMA in proportion to its annual net turnover.
Entities which are located outside of the EU but provide ratings in the EU would also be regulated (similar to the EU Benchmarks regulation). This could be achieved by the European Commission adopting an equivalence decision for an overseas regime, such as the proposed UK regime. The UK may adopt a similar approach to equivalence.
A second option for overseas entities providing ESG ratings would be to seek endorsement for their ratings from an EU-authorised ESG ratings provider. ESMA would be required to approve the endorsement and the EU entity would take on the risk that inapprorpriate ratings might be provided. For entities based in overseas jurisdictions where ESG ratings regimes are not as developed as in the EU, compliance with IOSCO's recommendations for ESG ratings providers would be considered as equivalent with compliance with the EU regulation. 
A final option for a third country provider would be to gain 'recognition' from ESMA. In order to do this, the provider would need to have an annual net turnover on its ESG rating activities below EUR 12 million for three consecutive years and a legal representative in the EU to be accountable for the provider's obligations under the regulation.

What are the proposed requirements for providers?

Providers would be required to maintain independence. As currently drafted, ESG rating providers would not be able to offer a number of other services including credit ratings, benchmarks, consulting, audit, investment activities, insurance or banking. Firms should also develop processes to monitor, manage and disclose to ESMA potential independence or conflict of interest issues. ESMA may require the ratings provider to take measures to mitigate conflicts of interest, including establishment of an independent oversight function representing stakeholders or ceasing the activities or relationship that create the conflict of interest.
Analysts providing ESG opinions would also be subject to independence requirements, including not being able to take up a key management position at an entity for which they have provided an opinion within six months of that opinion.
Providers must develop written policies to demonstrate that their ESG ratings are based on a thorough consideration of all available information. 
Providers must publish on their website the methodologies, models and key rating assumptions they use in their ESG rating activities.
The methodologies used by firms to develop ratings must be 'rigorous, systematic, objective and capable of validation'. Methodologies must be reviewed at least annually. The sources of data used and how they are used would be subject to strict record-keeping requirements, to the extent that determination of the ESG rating is replicable by another party.
To set the tone from the top, a permanent and effective oversight function should be established to oversee the end-to-end process of providing ESG ratings including oversight of outsourced functions.
The regime would be underpinned by powers to enforce penalty fines, including up to 10% of total annual net turnover of the ratings provider. This penalty scheme would bring the regime for ESG ratings broadly into line with the existing regime for credit ratings agencies.

Timeline

The consultation closes on 10 August 2023. The proposal will then move through the EU legislative process, including the development of technical standards (RTS) by ESMA. Assuming no speedbumps, the earliest that we could expect to see agreement on the final regime would be mid-2024 — however this seems ambitious given the European Parliament elections next year and the current book of work. The final Regulation would apply six months after coming into force with providers needing to apply for authorisation from ESMA within this period, although smaller rating providers will be allowed 24 months to apply for authorisation.

Next steps for 'ESG Ratings' providers

Consider the proposed definitions and how they may be applied to existing ESG data/ratings products. 
Perform an impact assessment of the proposed regime, with a focus on governance structures, oversight and managing potential conflicts of interest.
Benchmarking of the EU proposals against the equivalent UK proposals and voluntary codes of conduct.
Overseas firms should consider options for structuring their ESG ratings business. For example, in the future will a regulated entity be required within the European Union or will one of the third-country mechanisms be suitable/applicable?

Our people",
https://kpmg.com/xx/en/our-insights/regulatory-insights/regulating-esg-ratings-providers.html,Regulatory Insights,Regulating ESG ratings providers,,"HM Treasury (HMT) is consulting on a potential new regulatory regime for ESG ratings providers, which would bring them within the regulatory perimeter of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). As the use of ESG ratings increases, HMT is seeking to improve transparency and promote good conduct in the ESG ratings market. HMT's proposals cover a wide range of ESG-linked data and ratings products, including all products which make an `assessment' of ESG factors, even if not labelled as such. The new regime could affect all firms providing ESG assessments to users in the UK, even if the providing firm is based overseas. The consultation closes on 30 June 2023.

The proposed regulatory regime

HMT's proposals reflect increasing global regulatory concern around ESG ratings — see our previous article.
In the UK, under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (FSMA), firms carrying out activities which are specified under the Regulated Activities Order (RAO) must be authorised by an appropriate regulator, unless exempt. HMT determines which activities are specified in the RAO.
HMT's consultation relates to proposals to expand the regulatory perimeter, using an amendment to the RAO, to require all firms carrying out the activity of a direct provision of an assessment of environmental, social or governance factors to a user in the UK to become FCA-authorised, meet specified Threshold Conditions and comply with the FCA principles of business. Once the regulatory perimeter has been formally expanded, the FCA would then set firm-facing requirements in its rules.
HMT is also legislating, through the Financial Services and Markets Bill, to create a new Designated Activities Regime (DAR). Any person conducting a designated activity will be required to follow rules for it, unless they are exempt. However, unlike the RAO, persons carrying out activities under the DAR would not automatically have to be authorised. HMT is also considering whether the DAR could be used to regulate the provision of ESG ratings.
HMT and the FCA have indicated that the regulatory requirements eventually put in place for ESG ratings providers are likely to be in line with IOSCO recommendations and will cover transparency, good governance, management of conflicts of interest and robust systems and controls.

How will `ESG ratings' be defined?

HMT's proposed definition of ESG ratings is broad and would cover 'an assessment regarding one or more environmental, social, and governance factors, whether or not it is labelled as such'. Because the aim of the proposed regime would be to improve the reliability of information which affects the allocation of capital, only assessments used in `by persons in the UK in relation to an RAO specified investment' (a wide range of investments related to financial services) would be included. This approach requires ESG rating providers to understand how their ESG rating is being used, therefore the consultation asks whether they currently capture such information.
Under HMT's definition, the following products would not be captured:
Raw data
Minimally processed data (for example summarised or formatted data)
Estimates and proxies used to fill gaps in a data set
Other data and ratings products would be in scope, including those which are currently marketed as data-only products. This would include assessments which have been produced directly by analysts, but also those generated by AI/algorithms, due to the human assessment involved at the inception of the AI or algorithmic process.

Territorial scope

At a minimum, HMT proposes to include ESG ratings that are provided to users in the UK, even if the providing firm is located overseas. This would include ratings provided for institutional and retail users. HMT asks UK users of ratings whether this proposal would hamper the choice of ESG ratings available.

Proportionality

The consultation notes that ""both the scope of who any potential regulation applies to, and the regulatory requirements themselves, should be targeted and proportionate to the risks that ESG ratings pose."" HMT is trying to balance the benefits of applying a regulatory regime to all sizes of provider with the possible negative impact that the disproportionately greater cost of being regulated could have on small providers and thus on competition and innovation. 
Many of the larger providers of ESG ratings are already authorised under FSMA as credit rating agencies or benchmark providers — for them the impact of other ESG-related products becoming regulated will be less. HMT is therefore considering a baseline regulatory regime applied to all firms, with larger providers then subject to greater regulatory oversight and obligations. The consultation also asks for evidence of impacts on smaller providers and questions what criteria should be used to define them.

Exclusions

HMT proposes a number of exclusions to the regime to try to ensure that its scope is appropriate and proportionate. These include:
The provision of ESG-ratings by not-for-profit entities
Credit ratings which consider the impact of ESG factors on creditworthiness — as these are already subject to requirements under Credit Ratings Agencies Regulation
Investment research products, such as equity research reports
Ratings which are created by an entity solely for use by that entity — although HMT does question whether `intra-group rating' should be excluded

Next steps

When the consultation closes, HMT will consider the responses before finalising its approach. HMT's preferred approach is through amendment to the RAO in conjunction with a new DAR. Once agreed amendments have been made to the regulatory perimeter, the FCA will be able to further refine and clarify the details of the regime through consultation on specific rules for firms.
In the meantime, a voluntary code of conduct for ESG data and ratings providers is being developed by an FCA working group, with the first outputs expected in Q3 2023. Firms engaging voluntarily with this code are likely to find the transition to a more formalised regulatory regime significantly less resource-intensive.
Firms providing ESG data-linked products and services should review HMT's proposals in the context of their offerings to understand how they might be impacted. Firms which do not have a clear understanding of the processing and assessment features of their data products may face greater challenges when the final regulatory regime is implemented.

https://kpmg.com/xx/en/our-insights/regulatory-insights/capturing-climate-related-financial-risks-in-the-basel-framework.html,Regulatory Insights,Capturing climate-related financial risks in the Basel Framework,,"February 2023

There has been much debate about how best to reflect climate-related financial risks within the banking prudential framework. Initial regulatory focus was on sizing the exposure to the physical and transition risks of climate change, through exercises such as the Bank of England's (BoE's) Climate Biennial Exploratory Scenario (CBES) and the European Central Bank's (ECB's) stress test. UK and EU regulators have set out clear expectations for banks to reflect these risks in their risk management frameworks, and good practice has started to emerge, for example via thematic feedback from the PRA
opens in a new tab
 (PDF 243KB) and ECB
opens in a new tab
 (PDF 745KB) in Q4 2022 (for more details see here).
In December 2022, the Basel Committee for Banking Supervision (BCBS) published a short set of FAQs
opens in a new tab
 (PDF 297KB), clarifying how climate-related risks should be captured in the existing Basel Framework and incorporated into banks' Pillar 1 calculations. The FAQs are an important marker in the climate capital debate as they appear to support the view that the existing prudential regime may be sufficient to capture these risks — and provide further guidance to banks on how to do so.
Key clarifications in the FAQs include:
Calculation of risk weighted assets (RWA) for credit risk — to the extent that the risk profile of a counterparty is affected by climate-related risks, banks should consider counterparty creditworthiness as part of their due diligence procedures. These risks should be integrated in either their own credit risk assessments or when using external ratings. This also applies to covered bonds and their issuing banks.
General corporate exposures — banks in jurisdictions that do not allow the use of external ratings for regulatory purposes may assign a 65% risk weight to exposures to “investment grade” corporates. When determining whether a given corporate meets the investment grade definition, banks should evaluate how material climate-related risks, including under adverse conditions, will impact the capacity of the corporate to meet its financial commitments in a timely manner. Banks should also rely on a systematic credit review process to identify, at an early stage, whether the credit quality of the corporate has decreased such that it no longer meets the “investment grade” definition.
Specialised lending — when determining whether project finance should be classified as ""high-quality"", banks should consider the extent to which climate-related risks will have an adverse impact on the ability of the entity to meet its financial commitments in a timely manner. Banks should evaluate these impacts on an ongoing basis.
Regulatory real estate exposures — national supervisors have a duty to evaluate whether risk weights for real estate exposures are appropriate in their jurisdiction. National supervisors must consider the impact of weather-related hazards, regulatory and political transition risks and changes in consumer behaviour when making this assessment. Additionally, banks should determine whether the current market value incorporates the potential changes in the value of properties emerging from climate-related financial risks, including but not limited to those listed above.
Internal-ratings based (IRB) approach — when using the supervisory slotting criteria for specialised lending, banks should analyse how climate-related risks could negatively impact the assignment to a category. This analysis should include impacts on financial strength, political and legal risks, physical risks and asset characteristics. The mitigation of relevant risks should also be considered. When assigning ratings to borrowers and instruments, banks should consider material and relevant information on the impact of the risks on the borrower's financial condition and facility characteristics. This includes physical and transition risks and their mitigation. Analysis should be performed both during onboarding and as an ongoing process. When information is insufficient, banks should be conservative in assigning grades.
Ratings assignment horizon — banks should assess whether climate-risks will have an impact on obligors' ability to perform and this information should be integrated in rating assignments. Data should be collected at an appropriately granular level.
Stress tests used in assessment of capital adequacy — a bank that uses the IRB approach should consider climate-related risks that may significantly impact its credit exposures within the assessment period.
Overall requirements for estimation (structure and intent) — when estimating probability of defaults (PDs), loss-given defaults (LGDs) and exposure at default (EAD), there are challenges that include the range of impact uncertainties, limitations in the availability and relevance of historical data describing the relationship of climate risk drivers to traditional financial risks, and questions around the time horizon. Banks that have portfolios materially exposed to climate-related financial risks should consider these directly in estimates, adding a margin of error to reflect data deficiencies or scarcity.
Requirements specific to PD estimation — corporate, sovereign and bank exposures — when mapping internal PD grades to the scale used by an external credit assessment institution, banks should consider whether the scale reflects material climate-related financial risks. Where it does, banks should critically evaluate the models and methods used given challenges with data sources, granularity and historical time series. Where it does not, banks should consider whether adjustments are appropriate to mitigate this limitation.
Requirements specific to own-LGD estimates — standards for all asset classes — when assigning ratings to facilities, banks should consider material and relevant information on the impact of climate-related risks on the facility characteristics. An effective process to maintain relevant data should be established. Where a bank has insufficient information to estimate the LGD, it should consider whether a more conservative approach should be taken. Banks should add a margin of conservatism due to data deficiencies, such as poor data quality or scarce climate-related data, and to other sources of additional uncertainties.
Calculation of RWA for operational risk (OPE) — to ensure that losses stemming from climate-related risks are identifiable, losses whose root cause could stem from relevant risk drivers should be identifiable from the loss database. A bank that is perceived to misrepresent sustainability-related practices or the sustainability-related features of its investment products could face litigation. Operational risks (e.g. power cuts) may also affect services and communications.
Calculation of RWA for market risk (MAR) — banks should consider material climate-related risk drivers in their stress -testing to assess the potential impact on market risk positions, including the impact of a sudden shock to the value of financial instruments, correlations between risk factors, and the pricing and availability of hedges. Material climate-related financial risks should be incorporated iteratively and progressively in stress-testing programmes and internal capital assessment processes (ICAAPs) as the methodologies and data used to analyse these risks mature over time and analytical gaps are addressed.
Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) — when assessing the impact on net cash outflows or the value of liquidity buffer assets, banks must consider material climate-related financial risks. Supervisors should consider material climate-related financial risks among the range of other considerations in determining a response to a bank's use of high-quality liquid assets (HQLA). For example, climate-related risks may impact both prevailing and forward-looking assessments of macroeconomic and financial conditions that are relevant in addressing a reported LCR below 100%, consistent with the overall approach to the prudential framework.

Implications

The FAQs serve as a helpful guide on what the BCBS considers good practice and how firms should approach their Pillar 1 calculations. However, they do not constitute binding requirements and in due course, they may be supplemented by specific requirements from the PRA and ECB. The BCBS will issue additional FAQs as needed, to facilitate implementation of the existing Basel Framework, and as the availability of sufficiently granular data and consistent measurement methodologies for climate-related risks improves over time.

https://kpmg.com/xx/en/our-insights/regulatory-insights/resolution-regime-for-insurers.html,Regulatory Insights,Resolution regime for insurers,,"HM Treasury (HMT) is consulting
opens in a new tab
 until 20 April on a resolution regime for insurers (IRR). As anticipated in KPMG's 2022 paper A resolution framework for insurers — what can the industry expect?, HMT proposes a dedicated resolution framework for insurers and a new Resolution Authority (RA), housed within the Bank of England.
The RA has been tasked with:
Pre-resolution planning: conducting resolvability assessments and recovery and resolution planning (RRP) to ensure the RA has an executable strategy for dealing with a potential failure.
Exercising judgement (in consultation with the PRA, FCA and HMT), as to whether an insurer that is `failing or likely to fail' (FOLTF) should be subject to its new stabilisation powers (such as transfer to a third party or a bridge entity, and bail in) — and then deploying these. 
Failure of insurers in the UK has been a rare occurrence. The exits that have happened have been successfully managed primarily via solvent run offs and portfolio transfers under Part VII of the Financial Services and Market Act (FSMA). We envisage that these will continue to be the usual routes towards exit, with the IRR stabilisation powers only triggered in exceptional cases.

Scope

The reach of the IRR is intentionally broad, able to draw in all UK authorised insurers1. Out of scope are insurers not subject to Solvency II, friendly societies, and Lloyd's and its market2. However, HMT envisages only a subset of insurers to be subject to the IRR in practice.
RA-led preparation for resolution is primarily intended for systemically important firms. HMT points to the list of the UK firms designated as Internationally Active Insurance Groups (IAIGs) as a useful — but non-exhaustive — indicator of who might be caught. Insurers deemed to provide `critical functions' may also be asked to plan for a smooth exit and continued provision of these services to policyholders. Critical functions are only loosely defined in the consultation as those whose sudden discontinuation would be likely to disrupt services that are essential to the UK economy or endanger the financial stability of the UK.
The RA would also need to exercise judgement, largely based on a public interest assessment, at the point of FOLTF as to whether to take charge of the insurer's resolution and apply stabilisation powers or let the usual winding down or insolvency processes run their course. Again, HMT envisages that only a small number of cases would require recourse to the RA tools.

How does IRR fit in with existing measures?

The IRR has parallels to the resolution regime for banks (Part 1 of the Banking Act) and the EU's proposed Insurance Recovery and Resolution Directive (IDD). It also closely mirrors the framework set out in the Financial Stability Board's paper on Key Attributes of effective resolution regimes for financial institutions
opens in a new tab
.
There are some notable differences, however, including the absence of a minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities as in bank resolution reflecting the different structure and risk profile of an insurer's balance sheet, and the addition of tools specific to the restructuring of insurance liabilities.
The IRR would sit on top of existing approaches to recovery and resolution, including:
Existing — and about to be expanded — PRA requirements to prepare for recovery and exit.
PRA's `ladder of intervention' powers under Solvency II.
Insolvency regime for insurers currently being modified as part of the Financial Services and Markets Bill (FSMB), the implementation of which the PRA is currently consulting on
opens in a new tab
.

Implications for insurers

Insurers will effectively face a two-tier system for recovery and resolution planning and exit. Firms deemed systemically important, particularly complex or as providing critical services will be subject to scrutiny by new RA (as well as the PRA). The remainder will continue to be in the PRA's domain and should keep an eye out for a consultation later in 2023 which is expected to extend and clarify expectations. This is consistent with the PRA's `Dear CEO' letter to insurers, which highlighted its expectation for smaller insurers to consider how they might exit the market.
As ever, the extent and degree of impact will depend on the supervisory approach, and the consultation leaves open important aspects such as the precise definition of systemic insurer and critical services. Insurers in the grey area will want to have clarity as soon as possible as to whether they are within the RA's remit, but all firms would benefit from early preparation and regulatory engagement on their recovery and resolution plans given this is a key area of supervisory focus.
Insurers would benefit from being proactive in demonstrating how any potential barriers to resolvability can be mitigated or resolved, rather than waiting for enforceable direction from the RA.
Firms could get on the front foot by:
Considering governance and resourcing arrangements to effectively engage with the RA on information requests, simulation exercises and operational assessments.
Reviewing existing recovering and resolution plans and mapping out to what extent they demonstrate readiness for the application of the stabilisation powers. Elements such as corporate structure, contractual features, outsourcing and operational processes may be covered already but require an additional level of analysis to assess for barriers to resolvability.
Assessing the challenges of preparing for the valuation of balance sheets in distress, particularly life insurers with long-term liabilities and assets matched to support these.
Considering if any of products or services could be deemed critical, via a two-step assessment of substitutability (do others in the market offer similar products or could easily take over their continued operation?) and policyholder impact of sudden withdrawal. Firms will then need to have an operational plan to ensure the critical products can continue operating — by being clear on the functions that underpin them (customer-facing services such as claims handling, internal functions such as finance, operations and HR, and including any third party providers) and how these can continue to support continued operation in times of distress. 
Given an increasingly complicated patchwork of requirements, insurers would benefit from their preparations dovetailing with related workstreams, including operational resilience. Similarly, firms may consider how the stress testing of operational continuity could interlink with simulation exercises of resolvability.
Finally, with two authorities involved in pre-exit planning, impacted insurers will be hoping for effective information sharing and commonality of purpose between the PRA and RA to avoid significant duplication. HMT envisages close cooperation between the PRA and RA on their recovery and resolution work but, in practice, a degree of overlap — or even divergence — may be inevitable given distinct, if complementary, statutory objectives.

Next steps

After the consultation closes, HMT and the PRA will have some way to go to finalise the policy. The proposals would require legislative change, the granting of a delegated power to HMT to define critical functions and the development of a Code of Practice for the use of the Resolution tools.
As mentioned above, this would be in parallel to the modifications being made to the insurance insolvency framework as part of the FSMB. The PRA is also expected to consult this year on requirements for insurers to prepare exit plans — of broader applicability than the IRR.

Overview of the IRR

Objectives of the IRR
To protect and enhance the stability of the financial system of the UK, in particular by: (a) preventing contagion; and (b) protecting the ability of those who are or may become insurance policyholders to access critical functions, including the continuity of services on existing policies.
To protect and enhance public confidence in the stability of the financial system of the UK.
To protect public funds, including by minimising reliance on extraordinary public financial support.
To protect policyholders of the firm in resolution, including those covered by an insurance guarantee scheme.
To avoid interfering with property rights in contravention of a Convention Right (within the meaning of the Human Rights Act 1998).
Resolution conditions (RC)
All these conditions have to be met for an insurer to be placed in RA-led resolution
RC 1: the PRA assesses that an insurer is failing or likely to fail (FOLTF).
RC 2: the RA assesses that, having regard to timing and other relevant circumstances, it is not reasonably likely that (ignoring the stabilisation powers) action will be taken by or in respect of the insurer that will result in RC 1 ceasing to be met.
RC 3: the RA assesses that the exercise of the stabilisation powers is necessary having regard to the public interest in the advancement of one or more of the statutory resolution objectives.
RC 4: the RA assesses that one or more of the statutory resolution objectives would not be met to the same extent if stabilisation powers were not deployed.
Stabilisation options
Transfer to a Private Sector Purchaser: the RA would be able to make a full or partial transfer of the shares or the business of a failing insurer to a willing private sector purchaser via a transfer of securities or property (i.e., assets and liabilities). Crucially, the RA would be able to do this outside of the Part VII mechanism, side-stepping the usual process of obtaining court approval, policyholder consent and consulting with other authorities.
Bridge Institution: the RA would be empowered to establish a temporary bridge institution. This would allow additional time for due diligence and valuation while ensuring that critical functions can continue to be provided.
Bail In: the RA would have the power to restructure, modify, limit or write down the failing insurer’s liabilities in order of creditor preference, including insurance liabilities. The Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) would provide top up payments covering eligible policyholders up to the same limits that would apply under insolvency. The objective of bail in is to restore a level of capital coverage sufficient to proceed to solvent run off. Asking policyholders to bear some of the cost of failure can be controversial, as seen in reactions to the EU’s proposed framework, although — unlike in the EU — this would offset by FSCS protection.
Temporary public ownership: proposed as a temporary measure of last resort.
Additional tools
Balance sheet management: power to establish an asset management vehicle for the run-down of non-performing or difficult-to-value assets, providing an opportunity to maximise the value of assets through a more orderly wind down over time.
Insurance administration procedure: providing the RA with the flexibility to use the stabilisation tools above while ensuring the insurer’s critical function can continue to operate.
Other considerations
Ancillary powers: The RA would be given wide-ranging ancillary powers, including the power to remove or replace directors and senior managers, prohibit the payment of dividends and temporarily suspend payments to creditors.
Cross-border considerations: the HMT intends for the IRR to provide a framework for the RA to recognise — or not — the resolution actions taken by other jurisdictions’ authorities. The consultation is short on detail on its approach to resolution of cross-border insurers, and firms are at risk of being subject to duplicative or conflicting planning requirements and/or resolution actions.
No Creditor Worse Off (NCWO): HMT is looking to provide for a mechanism by which creditors would be provided with NCWO compensation, in line with the principle that creditors should receive at a minimum what they would have received under insolvency.
Pre-resolution planning
  Resolvability assessments: aimed at identifying and addressing the barriers to resolution. Resolvability assessments will build on work already carried out (or planned) by the PRA but would go a step further in getting firms ready for exit. This includes giving the RA the power to direct a firm to remedy any barriers to resolvability so that stabilisation tools can be effectively applied.
Ongoing Recovery and Resolution Planning (RRP): these would set out the proposed resolution strategy for an insurer and an operational plan for implementation, including what stabilisation powers would be applied and how. The plans would be updated on an annual basis or more frequently if there are changes to the firm’s structure, strategy or operating condition. Again, this would leverage — but go beyond — work already done in fulfilment of the PRA’s requirements.

In 2023, the PRA will continue to focus on financial and operational resilience, financial risks arising from climate change, governance and risk management, and diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) across all sectors. It will also prioritise readiness for ISO 20022 common messaging in CHAPS as part of the RTGS Renewal programme and data quality and accuracy for all banks. UK Deposit Takers should expect continued focus on credit and model risk. For insurers, exit planning and reinsurance risk will be on the agenda.

Cross-sector priorities

The PRA reiterates the same messaging in all three letters on: 
The financial risks arising from climate change — the PRA will continue to review compliance against SS3/19 and expects firms to take a proactive approach to addressing climate-related financial risks.
DEI — the PRA plans to issue a new consultation (jointly with the Bank of England (BoE) and FCA and building on DP2/21) on proposals for a new regulatory framework on DEI for the financial sector.
Supervisory approach — from January 2023, the PRA has updated its approach to categorising the 'potential impact' of firms and refined its risk assessment framework and core assurance work. Individual firms will be notified directly where this results in any changes to the supervisory workplan. The Financial Services and Markets Bill, if passed into law, will also introduce a new secondary competitiveness and growth objective for the PRA.
The PRA also includes specific sector-tailored messaging as found below.

Financial resilience

Banks should be proactive in assessing the implications of the evolving economic outlook on their business models — including consideration of broader structural changes.
Capital and liquidity — the PRA will continue to assess individual banks' capital and liquidity positions with particular focus on the impact of evolving retail and wholesale funding conditions, as well as scheduled maturities of drawings from the Term Funding Scheme.
Credit risk — UK banks should prepare for a prolonged period of stress, ensuring that their credit risk management practices are robust, customer support and collections arrangements are appropriately scaled, and expected credit loss provisions are recognised in a timely manner. The PRA will increase its engagement in these areas, including targeted requests for enhanced data and a focus on traditionally higher-risk areas such as retail credit card portfolios and unsecured personal loans.
Model risk — final model risk management policy is expected in H1 (building on CP 6/22), following which UK banks will be expected to implement the necessary changes. For Internal Ratings Based (IRB) models, the PRA will focus on three key workstreams: the implementation of IRB hybrid mortgage models, the IRB Roadmap for non-mortgage portfolios and IRB-aspirant bank model applications. The PRA will also increase its focus on new Fundamental Review of Trading Book (FRTB) models and banks' intended methodologies as part of the implementation of Basel 3.1 standards.
Life insurers should ensure they are robustly stress testing their capital planning against prolonged adverse credit scenarios. General insurers are expected to factor general and social inflation risk drivers into their underlying pricing, reserving, business planning, and capital modelling.

Operational risk and resilience

The PRA will continue to assess all firms against SS1/21
opens in a new tab
 for operational resilience. By now, they are expected to have identified and mapped their Important Business Services (IBS), set impact tolerances and commenced a programme of scenario testing. Over the next three years, firms will need to demonstrate their ability to operate within their impact tolerances under a range of severe but plausible scenarios, including cyber-attacks.
Firms should also continue to comply with the PRA's outsourcing/third party risk management policy, ensuring that their IBS can remain within impact tolerances even when they rely on outsourcing or third-party providers.
At the same time, firms must manage the impacts of increasing digitalisation. Not only should they account for any transition and execution risks, but, in particular, they must ensure they fully understand the impact of offering any crypto-related products.

Banks — RTGS, data, resolution and risk management

Certain priorities are flagged specifically for the banking sector:
RTGS — ISO 20022 messaging in CHAPS will be delivered by the BoE in June 2023 as part of the RTGS Renewal programme. The PRA expects banks to be ready for this change, ensuring cut-over to the new messaging standard without interruption to customer payments or liquidity management. Readiness preparation includes completing all necessary testing and participating in dress rehearsals. 
Data — the PRA will continue to use skilled persons reviews and will engage with banks on which data will be collected as part of the Banking Data Review.
Resolution — banks within scope of the UK's Resolvability Assessment Framework (RAF) should continue to ensure they achieve and maintain the relevant resolvability outcomes. They should also ensure they are transparent in their disclosures about their preparedness for resolution.
Risk management and governance — the PRA will continue to assess banks' risk management and control frameworks through individual and cross-firm thematic reviews — focusing on the ability to monitor and manage counterparty exposures.
For international banks active in the UK, individuals under the Senior Managers Regime will be accountable for addressing the PRA's 2023 priorities. The PRA expects these banks to reflect on their risk management, governance, and control frameworks — including a comprehensive review of onboarding and due diligence practices, as well as counterparty pricing and margining frameworks.
As UK deposit takers continue to accrue large and concentrated exposures to single counterparties (without fully understanding the associated risks), they must ensure that lessons from past crises are learned in full, and thoroughly embedded across the first and second lines of defence.

Insurers — Reform, reinsurance and risk management

Regulatory reform — the PRA will consult on Solvency II reform implementation and complete branch authorisations currently within the temporary regime.
Reinsurance risk — the PRA is paying close attention to whether the continued high level of longevity reinsurance and the emergence of the more complex `funded reinsurance' in the UK life market reduces the protection UK policyholders should have. It is particularly concerned about the potential for offshored counterparty concentration risk to arise from rapidly growing levels of reinsurance. The PRA will examine the need for policy action on reinsurance structures and limits, to mitigate systemic risks to policyholders as part of its work on counterparty and concentration risk. In the meantime, it expects: 
UK-authorised firms to consider their compliance with the Prudent Person Principle (PPP) for the risks associated with their reinsurance activities.
Firms to consider the reinsurer's resilience over the whole duration of the exposures, as well as the potential impact from a mass recapture event where large concentrations to a small number of counterparties exist.
Risk management — the PRA expects firms to:
Assess their credit and counterparty credit risk management capabilities in light of widening credit spreads, rating downgrades, and defaults.
Reassure themselves of the continue validity of their models given the central role they play in supporting risk assessments.
Test the resilience of liquidity sources to market dysfunction and the re-evaluate potential liquidity demands created by use of derivatives for risk managements. 
Ease of exit — the PRA will consult on requirements under Fundamental Rule 8 (to prepare for resolution), to provide firms with more specific expectations around improving their ease of exit. In the meantime, firms should continue to develop their exit plans, with specific focus on timely execution and the practicalities around transferring run-off books of business.
Non-natural catastrophe risk — as exposure management capabilities in this area remain immature, firms could become exposed to the risk of outsized losses and may underestimate their capital requirements. The PRA therefore intends to work with industry to enhance practice and better manage risk in this area.
Bulk purchase annuity (BPA) markets — the PRA will conduct a thematic review on risk management in BPA markets and focus on credit and counterparty risk and liquidity demands arising from derivative instruments.

https://kpmg.com/xx/en/our-insights/regulatory-insights/systemic-or-non-systemic-that-is-the-question.html,Regulatory Insights,Systemic or non-systemic...that is the question,,"December 2023
In early November, the FCA and Bank of England (BoE) published sister discussion papers on proposals for the regulation of, respectively, non-systemic and systemic fiat-backed stablecoin (FBS) payment systems. These proposals reveal important differences between the two regimes, which have significant implications for developing business models in the space.

Overview

As described in our previous article, HM Treasury (HMT) plans to bring FBS within the regulatory perimeter by amending the Payment Services Regulation 2017 and creating two new activities — issuance and custody — under the Regulated Activities Order 2001 (RAO). That article considered, in detail, the FCA's discussion paper
opens in a new tab
 (PDF 1.4 MB) (DP) on rules related to both activities. 
The BoE has now published a further discussion paper
opens in a new tab
 (DP) on the regulatory framework for FBS systems deemed systemic (or likely to become systemic). The BoE and Payment Systems Regulator (PSR) already regulate operators of traditional systemic payment systems (and service providers that provide `essential services') once recognised or designated by HMT. Legislative changes (under FSMA 2023) expanded this remit to include operators that transfer `digital settlement assets' — which includes FBS.
In the context of FBS, the BoE's remit can capture operators of systemic payment systems using FBS, systemic service providers (e.g. issuers, wallet providers, exchanges) or related service providers. The latter two categories could be recognised as systemic in their own right or systemic because they provide essential services to a systemic system or systemic service provider.
The BoE's DP is specifically scoped to address systems that are:
Payments-focused — i.e. FBS systems that are widely used for payments in the UK.
Retail-focused — i.e. FBS systems used by households and non-financial businesses. The BoE will set out its views on wholesale settlement “in due course” — it has alluded to potentially updating the RTGS system so that it can connect with a wider range of ledgers.
GBP-denominated — however, the BoE will monitor non-GBP denominated FBS that are being widely used and consider whether the regime requires amending.

Designation as systemic

The DP notes that HMT is responsible for designating `systemic' status where “any deficiencies in design of system, or disruption to operation, would likely threaten stability of, or confidence in, the UK financial system, or could have serious consequences for business or other interests in the UK”. 
The BoE must be consulted as part of HMT's decision and will consider: 
The number and value of the transactions passing through the system.
The nature of the transactions — e.g. criticality, currency denomination and risk profile. 
Whether the transactions could be handled by other systems —  i.e. substitutability and continuity. 
The relationship with other systems — e.g. connectedness with systemically important FMIs, institutions and governments. 
Whether the system is used by the BoE in its role as a monetary authority.
With a particular eye on Bigtech firms, the BoE may also recommend designation as systemic where a system is not currently operating at systemic scale but is likely to do so in the future (“systemic at launch”).
Once recognised as systemic, a relevant entity (or entities) would be subject to the BoE's powers to (i) obtain information, (ii) issue principles and binding codes of practice, (iii) make directions and (iv) issue enforcements. 
The BoE will work with HMT and other regulators to allow for a smooth transition into the systemic regime and minimise regulatory overlaps. This co-operation will be set out in an MoU which is reviewed annually. 
Interestingly, the BoE has said that it would not deem existing stablecoins (which are mainly pegged to USD) or any new sterling equivalent similarly focused on “transactions in the crypto world” systemic.

Summary of proposals

Leveraging the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (PFMIs)
opens in a new tab
 (PDF 296 KB) as a starting point, the BoE has proposed the following:

What does this mean for firms?

The proposals have significant implications for developing stablecoin business models, for example:
Firms with a large user base may be recognised as systemic at launch. Other firms may begin to operate as non-systemic and later have to navigate the transition onto the BoE's systemic regime. Where such firms are already regulated by the FCA (e.g. as an issuer) they would also become regulated by the BoE and, where relevant, the PSR. Close engagement between the industry and regulators is needed to enable firms that are close to reaching systemic levels to prepare for, and thus mitigate the costs of, transition.
If an issuer transitioned onto the systemic regime, it would need to entirely convert its backing assets into central bank deposits. Moreover, it would lose the ability to retain interest on these assets. The BoE encourages firms to build revenue-generating use cases in payments (such as efficiency, cost and functionality) rather than rely on interest rates. 
In order to quell BoE concerns about chains operating in a fully decentralised manner, systemic systems would need to identify a PSO to operate as an accountable `central entity'. Firms would need to determine solutions for how the PSO could ensure overall compliance as well as attest to the quality of the system's infrastructure and settlement assets. 
Firms could be caught under new location requirements. Systemic issuers would automatically be subject to UK subsidiarisation while other entities might also be caught under the BoE's powers of direction.
Firms may need to determine how to implement holding limits for customers which could prove operationally difficult to enforce due to the multiplicity of entities within the blockchain (e.g. issuers, wallets, exchanges). 
More clarity is expected once the BoE and FCA DP feedback deadlines pass in February 2024, and they move into the consultation phase. KPMG in the UK can support firms with the wide range of challenges stemming from these developments. If you have any questions or would like to discuss further, please get in touch.

https://kpmg.com/xx/en/our-insights/regulatory-insights/wholesale-market-data.html,Regulatory Insights,Wholesale market data,,"After some delay, the FCA has published the findings of its trade data review and launched an all-encompassing wholesale data market study.
The FCA has been investigating the cost and access to market data since early 2020, when it launched a Call for Input on the subject. Feedback and views on whether competition was working for the supply of wholesale data were mixed, largely reflecting respondents' positions in the market. In its Feedback Statement, the FCA highlighted its concern that competition issues in these markets may be leading to high pricing and therefore increase costs to end investors. The FCA signalled then it would continue to review the market in trading data and would launch market studies into benchmarks and credit rating agencies where it also had concerns around competition.

Findings of trade data review

The review found that the market in trade data does not work as effectively as it could in allowing competition and innovation. In particular:
Some trading markets are concentrated among a few firms so there is little choice for users when buying this data and switching supplier is not an easy option.
MiFIR-based requirements on pricing trade data on a reasonable commercial basis don't appear to be a significant constraint on pricing.
The way data is sold can be complex, making it harder for data users to compare costs and to make informed choices.
Complexity and limited choice result in additional costs to data users such as asset managers. These are likely to be passed on to UK retail investors and savers.
Despite rules in place requiring delayed data to be distributed for free, many users end up with little choice but to pay for data.
Evidence suggests that trade data is a highly profitable business line and contributes considerably to the high margins earned by some firms.

Wholesale data market study

The FCA wholesale data market study will now consolidate the market studies for benchmarks, credit ratings data and market data vendor services. FCA market studies are in-depth, evidence-driven investigations. If the FCA finds problems in a market, it could introduce regulations or other policy interventions in the future, and in the extreme, could introduce more restrictive forms of price regulation. For this particular study, the FCA will decide whether to make a market investigation reference to the Competition and Markets Authority after six months and the final report is due in a year.
The market study is particularly broad in scope covering regulated and unregulated markets which contributes to the complexity of the study. The FCA is looking to review six themes:
Barriers to entry and expansion
 Network effects
 Vertical integration
 Suppliers' commercial practices
Behaviour of data users
Incentives for innovation
Providers in the market will likely be asked to provide detailed submissions to the FCA on the functioning of the markets in question and respond to information and data requests containing confidential information about their activities.

Other regulatory initiatives on data

Consolidated tape
The FCA is also working with the Government on developing the regulatory framework (introduced by MiFIR / MiFID II) to facilitate a consolidated tape for the UK. Similar developments are happening in the EU as part of the MiFIR review.
A consolidated tape collects market data, such as prices and volumes, from on-venue and OTC trading across the market and disseminates them in a standardised, single feed. It can include reports of pre-trade and/or post-trade data.
Reviews have found that a consolidated tape has not emerged in Europe as, amongst other reasons, the current structure of the market and legislative framework does not offer strong commercial incentives for a consolidated tape provider (CTP). Both jurisdictions are now looking to put place frameworks that would enable, for each asset class, a single private sector operated tape, that would be authorised and regulated.
The ongoing debate on the correct amendments to the framework includes discussion around:
Fee schedules, licensing and revenue sharing between data providers and the CTP.
How the rules and tender process can be designed to ensure a chosen CTP behaves, from a competition point of view, in a manner consistent with having multiple CTPs per asset class.
The FCA will use the findings of the trade data review to inform the design of the consolidated tapes and is planning to consult on the design in summer 2023. ESMA will consult on the model for the EU once the MiFIR review is agreed.
Consolidated tapes should improve the overall cost, quality and accessibility of wholesale data. Therefore, they are likely to have an impact on pricing and business models for wholesale market data.

ESG data, ratings and benchmarks

Many of the firms likely to be reviewed by the FCA wholesale market data study will also be selling ESG data and ratings. This market is currently unregulated but is rapidly growing. Regulators are concerned about the lack of alignment of definitions, lack of transparency on methodologies used, uneven coverage and management of conflicts of interest and are likely to bring within the regulatory perimeter. A recent FCA review of ESG benchmarks found the overall quality to be poor. Please see article for more details.

How KPMG can help

The KPMG Competition Economics team can assist firms facing competition and pricing investigations of this nature. It has substantial experience of representing firms in front of the FCA, CMA and other regulators as well as experience of working within regulators. The KPMG team has worked on many cases involving allegations of unreasonable or excessive pricing and weak competition and has an understanding of how regulators approach these questions.

https://kpmg.com/xx/en/our-insights/regulatory-insights/changes-to-the-benchmarks-regulation.html,Regulatory Insights,Changes to the Benchmarks Regulation,,"December 2023
Changes have been made and are being proposed to the Benchmarks Regulation in both the EU and UK. Benchmark administrators may want to review their business and compliance strategy in light of these changes.
The Benchmarks Regulation came into force in the EU (including at the time the UK) between 2016 and 2018. The Regulation was in reaction to issues such as the manipulation of LIBOR, FX and commodities benchmarks. Its aim was to improve transparency and mitigate conflicts of interest leading to more robust and reliable benchmarks. The existing Regulation builds upon (and goes beyond) the IOSCO 2013 Principles for Financial Benchmarks. It has a much wider scope than other jurisdictions that tend to regulate a more limited range of critical benchmarks or rely on self-regulation. 
As part of the process of the UK withdrawing from the EU, the UK on-shored the Benchmarks Regulation into UK legislation.
Concern has been building that many third country providers of benchmarks have not applied for authorisation in the EU even after two extensions of the transitional period. The Regulation had originally been drafted on the assumption that non-EU jurisdictions would develop comparably comprehensive rules for financial benchmarks. This would have allowed the Commission to recognise those regulatory systems as equivalent or would have enabled third country benchmark administrators to seek access to the EU market via the routes of recognition or endorsement with no or lower additional compliance efforts. However, this has not been the case. A European Commission report
opens in a new tab
 in July 2023 found that only 5 percent of the non-EU benchmark administrators currently supplying benchmarks to the EU market have obtained authorisation. The Commission raised the concern that, once the third country rules entered into force, the number of benchmarks available for EU supervised entities would drop considerably and could pose a risk to financial stability. Therefore, the Commission has now further extended the transitional regime to 31 December 2025.

Proposed changes in the EU

Given the above issues, the European Commission has proposed revisions to the EU Benchmark Regulation to reduce the administrative and regulatory burden imposed both on EU benchmark users and on EU benchmark administrators.
The proposal
opens in a new tab
:
Reduces the scope of the third-country rules to those benchmarks that are significant for the EU markets, therefore reducing the risk that users of benchmarks in the EU are not able to reference certain benchmarks.
For EU benchmarks, limits the scope of the Benchmarks Regulation to those that are significant, therefore ensuring there is a level playing field between third-country and EU benchmarks.
Significant benchmarks are classified as those benchmarks that are referenced by financial instruments and financial contracts with a total value above EUR 50 billion. As this is a strictly quantitative criterion, benchmark administrators will be required to monitor benchmark usage and self-report when they reach the threshold.
National supervisors (for EU benchmarks) and ESMA (for non-EU benchmarks) will be able to designate additional benchmarks that do not reach the quantitative threshold as significant but whose discontinuation could have a significant adverse impact on financial stability, market integrity or consumers.

Changes in the UK

When the Benchmarks Regulation was on-shored into the UK, the third country benchmarks transitional period expired at the end of 2025. HM Treasury (HMT) have recently announced that the transitional period will be extended to 31 December 2030. This is to allow the continued availability of the number and variety of important benchmarks in the UK, allowing 'UK companies to plan with confidence that they will not lose access to benchmarks that are critical to their operations'. 
Alongside this, the UK government is reviewing and repealing EU on-shored legislation — the Smarter Regulatory Framework programme. As part of this, HMT has announced it will consider where reforms are needed to the third country benchmarks regime. Indications are that the Benchmarks Regulation review will be in one of the later phases of the programme.

Implications for Benchmark Administrators and Users

The European Commission proposed changes to the Benchmark Regulation could be amended as they go through Parliament and Council processes and there is yet to be any detail available on possible UK changes. However, the direction of travel is clear, third country benchmark administrators are unlikely to have to comply with the full scope of the Benchmarks Regulation as currently in force in the EU and UK, and potentially may not have to apply for authorisation of some of their benchmarks.  
This initially suggests a reduction in the compliance burden to allow a wide range of benchmarks to be used in the EU and UK. 
However, many users of benchmarks may have gained additional comfort from the credibility of using a benchmark that was regulated and provided by an authorised benchmark administrator. Users may market their financial products referencing the regulated benchmark on the high level of standards that the benchmark provides. 
Benchmark administrators that produce 'significant' benchmarks may find it more complicated to administrate two different sets of requirements for significant and non-significant benchmarks, especially as benchmarks could shift from one set of requirements to another depending upon their usage or regulators' opinion. 
Benchmark administrators will need to reflect on their business models in light of these proposed changes. Differences in approach and timing between the UK and EU BMR regime may introduce unintended friction for both administrators and users. Benchmark administrators are likely to need to consider the requirements of their users in navigating the most suitable path through these compliance changes.
