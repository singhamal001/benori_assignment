    "## Overview\n",
    "This script extracts text from PDF files located in a specified folder and saves the extracted text into `.txt` files in an output folder. It uses the **PyMuPDF** library (imported as `fitz`) for PDF text extraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Main Functions\n",
    "1. **extract_text_from_pdf(pdf_path)**\n",
    "   - Extracts text from a PDF file.\n",
    "   - Returns the extracted text as a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **save_text_to_file(text, txt_path)**\n",
    "   - Saves the extracted text into a `.txt` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **convert_all_pdfs_to_txt(pdf_folder, output_folder)**\n",
    "   - Iterates through all PDF files in the input folder.\n",
    "   - Extracts text and saves it as a `.txt` file with the same base name.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Execution\n",
    "- The script is executed directly by running:\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  python script_name.py\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- It processes PDFs from the `pdf` folder and saves `.txt` files in the `txt` folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirements\n",
    "- `PyMuPDF` library.\n",
    "- Ensure `pdf` and `txt` folders exist or will be created automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Error Handling\n",
    "- Catches and prints exceptions if text extraction fails for any PDF.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Output\n",
    "- For `sample.pdf`, the output will be `sample.txt` in the `txt` folder.\n",
