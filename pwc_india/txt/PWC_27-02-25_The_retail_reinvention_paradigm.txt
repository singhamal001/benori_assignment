The retail reinvention 
paradigm
How brands could up their game
Foreword 
2  |    PwC  The retail reinvention paradigm
Amidst unprecedented disruption driven by the meteoric rise of e-commerce and the 
emergence of quick commerce – more than 280%1 during the last two years – India’s 
retail sector continues to evolve at a rapid pace. Brands now have a greater number of 
channels to sell their products across different categories to consumers. However, in order 
to reap the benefits of the choice of channels available, brands must strategically deploy a 
combination of channels to enhance consumer engagement and profitability, and capture 
a larger share of the market by maximising consumer utility.
To help both consumers and brands achieve this goal, our paper ‘The retail reinvention 
paradigm: How brands could up their game’ explores the intricate relationship among 
brands, channels, consumers and retailers in the offline and online space. Insights shared 
in this report are based on a survey, conducted in collaboration with Hansa Research, of 
over 1,000 retailers and 800 consumers across metro cities, tier 1, 2 and 3 cities in India. 
These insights are further complemented with the data collected in a survey, conducted in 
collaboration with Kirana Club of 508 retailers.
While several striking findings emerged, one that caught our attention was the continued 
success of brick-and-mortar retail in tier 2 and 3 cities. Despite the aggressive expansion 
of quick commerce, brick-and-mortar retail remains a robust channel in these cities, 
supported by independent retailers’ strong sense of service and engagement with their 
loyal consumer base. These retailers view the e-commerce landscape as an opportunity 
to enhance their offerings. What they are seeking is a level playing field in logistics, 
delivery and technology policies from the government, as well as equitable pricing from 
brands. Another revelation was the low awareness of and engagement with Open Network 
for Digital Commerce (ONDC), which underscores a critical gap in outreach, education 
and incentives pursued at driving retailer participation in the e-commerce ecosystem. 
Resilience, reinvention and resurgence define the mood of offline retailers, especially in 
tier 2 and tier 3 cities.
Both consumer and retail brands can use similar insights from this report. For example, 
they could seek ways of building a hybrid model in tier 2 and tier 3 cities which can 
deliver an engaging and personalised shopping experience of a brick-and-mortar retailer 
while retaining the utilities offered by digital channels. They could also consider actively 
collaborating with offline retailers to strengthen their technological offerings to make their 
business more agile.

As the retail sector continues to evolve, brands must visualise how consumer utility is 
driven based on channel choices across different categories and target consumer cohorts. 
They need to be cognisant of the geographic nuances which can impact the consumer 
utility profile and also tailor their channels in accordance with how the target consumers 
perceive utility. This will help brands become more relevant for their target consumers. It 
will also facilitate minimising choices and aid optimal resource allocation. To assist brands 
in this journey we have designed a ‘Retail reinvention framework,’ which helps retailers 
capture the unique nuances of their product offerings across channels and consumer 
groups and guides them in prioritising their next actions.
We hope this report inspires you to reimagine your business strategy and seize the 
exciting possibilities that lie ahead.

First they see a product, ask for its rate, and then they open an app online and tell me 
I am getting this rate online. What can I say to that?
– Home care store owner | Asansol
Sometimes, it’s hard to understand 
exactly what the customer wants. 
They often show us photos of 
products they’ve seen online, but it 
can be difficult to figure out where 
to source those items from. We have 
to search because there’s so much 
variety.
I give loans/credit to my customers. I 
used to do it earlier too, but now it has 
increased. I give around INR 10,000–
12,000, in fact I have also raised it to 
INR 30,000 for a customer. They get 
30-40 days to return it. I also do free 
home delivery for online orders.
Sometimes we think that a product 
might perform well in the market, 
but it doesn’t. Similarly, for this quick 
delivery, we are not sure if the demand 
would be there and our money could 
be wasted in keeping these additional 
stocks.
No matter how often we get new 
stock, we have noticed that customers 
always come in looking for specific 
trends. At first, it takes us some time 
to understand what is popular. By 
the time we figure it out and try to 
meet their expectations, the trend 
has already changed. This makes it 
difficult to always keep up with what 
customers want.

It is evident that not all is smooth sailing for the traditional retailers’ ship. Retailers are 
batting on a sticky wicket, one that demands maneuvering and good navigation skills, 
an accurate assessment of the retail landscape and environment, awareness of the 
potential hazards and essentially, the knowledge and ability to manage grey rhino events, 
not merely black swans. Therefore, it is time for retailers to reinvent themselves to be on 
the crest of the digital wave and enable customers to exercise the flexibility of making 
a purchase virtually or physically based on the cost of the product, ease of access and 
comfort of the buyer. 
Statistics indicate that
•	
Quick-commerce in India has expanded at an impressive 73% annual growth rate 
during FY 2023-242 
•	
77% of Indian shoppers prefer to shop from an omnichannel brand.3 
Overall, the retail market in India is expected to grow to USD 1,892 billion by FY30, at a 
compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.3%, with e-commerce, the fastest growing 
channel, notching a CAGR of 22.5% and touching USD 220 billion by FY30.4

On the face of it, this augurs well for the retail industry as disruption in the retail 
landscape today is more a norm than an exception. Traditional retail has made room for 
e-commerce by way of reduced cost, and the availability of a wider range of products 
and convenience. Quick commerce (Q-commerce) has taken that to the next level with its 
promise of ultra-fast delivery times which is further intensifying competition among retail 
giants. Omnichannel retailing, with its integration of various shopping channels – online, 
in-store, mobile, social media – provides a seamless customer experience across multiple 
touchpoints, giving consumers the flexibility to shop anytime, anywhere. The retail sector 
therefore is clearly in a state of flux, suffering from Jevons Paradox5 which implies that 
while e-commerce and omnichannel are leading the charge and facilitating, enhancing 
and accelerating the shopping experience, they are paradoxically making the competition 
fierce, prompting traditional retail to reinvent itself to stay the course. 
8  |    PwC  The retail reinvention paradigm
To understand the current dynamics of the retail sector in India, PwC India conducted 
a survey between December 2024 and January 2025 to:
•	
assess how traditional retailers perceive e-commerce/online shopping platforms
•	
understand the shift in consumer behaviour from offline6 to online7 shopping
•	
sift out opportunities for brands to be ahead of the evolving retail curve. 
The survey – conducted across metro cities and tier 1 cities such as Mumbai, Bengaluru, 
Jaipur, Bhubaneswar, Bhopal and tier 2 and tier 3 cities like Asansol, Amritsar, Gwalior 
and Karimnagar – included online interviews with several operational and sales heads of 
retailers and face-to-face interviews with 1,026 traditional retailers. 
Approximately 120 traditional retailers were covered under each specified category 
– apparel, white goods, beauty and personal care, fresh produce, packaged foods/
groceries, home care, fashion and accessories, home furnishing, and sports and 
fitness. Online interviews with 822 consumers provided a perspective on how shopping 
experiences were impacting their preferences for physical and virtual environments.

Jevons paradox is an economic theory formulated by William Stanley Jevons in 1865. It states that when 
a resource becomes more efficient, demand for it may increase instead of decrease. This is because the 
resource becomes cheaper to use, which can lead to more people using it. Jevons observed that more 
efficient steam engines would not reduce the amount of coal used in British factories, but would actually 
increase it. As coal became cheaper, demand for it would increase, which would lead to the construction of 
more engines. The paradox can be applied to other resources including energy-efficient cars, appliances, and 
light bulbs and, in this instance, retail.

This ushers in opportunities for them to realign and reinvent in accordance with the 
changing requirements of the retail world. From a growth perspective, capturing 
mindshare and wallet share across categories and channels demands a laser focus 
on maximising customer utility. This, in turn, entails finding the optimal combination of 
channels and categories to deliver maximum utility to an individual consumer at any given 
time. Importantly, while brands can control the utility to be delivered with their categories 
and channels, they can also influence the consumer’s decision by engaging the utility 
levers of pricing, convenience, variety, engagement and experience. Therefore, it becomes 
pertinent for brands to understand what utility looks like for each consumer cohort across 
the channel choices that consumers could consider in a product category.

Driving retail reinvention entails focusing on pivotal aspects of the retail ecosystem.  
Our research underscores the following four overarching themes that could perhaps  
set the course:
Is the omnichannel 
retail success 
greater than the 
sum of its parts? 
Is Q-commerce more 
common in metro 
cities and tier 1 cities 
than in tier 2 and tier 
3 cities?
What is the offline 
retailer’s recipe for 
success in the new-
age digital world?
How will the brick-
and-mortar retail 
reinvention unfold? 
Is the omnichannel retail success 
greater than the sum of its parts?
Customers don’t want to choose 
between online and offline. They 
want both. Some days, they 
want to shop from the comfort of 
their homes, and, on other days, 
they enjoy walking into a store 
and experiencing the products. 
We have to be ready for both 
situations.

The omnichannel retail experience in India is a work in progress. Though it has led to 
various levels of success for brands and consumers, the success is often perceived as 
more of a fragmented journey than a cohesive whole. The personal consumption space 
has embraced the online shift robustly, offering convenience and a wide array of choices. 
However, when it comes to family-oriented purchases, consumers still prefer a hybrid 
approach, blending online research with offline shopping to achieve a sense of tangible 
assurance and quality. Despite the potential technology has to offer to help them grow, 
brick-and-mortar retailers are yet to fully harness digital technologies to enhance in-store 
experiences effectively. The survey’s findings indicate:
For personal products, online shopping is the preferred choice for more than 50% of 
consumers, especially in categories such as apparel, beauty and personal care, fashion 
and accessories, and sports and fitness. On the other hand, family-related products, 
such as fresh produce, home furnishings, white goods and home care products, are still 
more commonly made in-store as these purchases often require more tactile and sensory 
engagement. While the shift to online shopping for personal items is indeed sharp and 
undeniable in metro cities and tier 1 cities, the overall trend is more nuanced. It is not 
an across-the-board transition but a segmented shift which differs between consumer 
categories and geographical areas.   
The shift towards online purchase is stronger when making purchases for 
individual consumption (53%) than for family/group purchases (36%).

While apparel and beauty and personal care categories are  
primary drivers of the ongoing shift toward online consumerism, 
nearly 45% of consumers still prefer a combination of both online 
and offline channels.

As digital platforms continue to evolve, some categories have capitalised on the inherent 
advantages of online shopping – increased demand for convenience, personalisation and 
immediacy. Interestingly though, nearly 50% of the consumers surveyed prefer a hybrid 
model, a combination of both channels when making purchases – driven essentially by 
the products to be purchased — thus keeping the tension between the offline and online 
channels alive. Physical stores still hold an appeal as 34% said they would prefer only 
offline shopping compared to 21% who said they would prefer only shopping online of the 
overall surveyed consumers. The primary reasons for shopping offline include the ability to 
see and try products before buying, the trust in the store/brand, and the in-store shopping 
experience. This is further corroborated by the fact that some retailers are beginning to 
personalise the offline experience for each customer, tapping into the hitherto untapped 
power of unique in-store experiences.

Consumers today expect more than just easy access to products — they seek engaging 
experiences that add value to their shopping journey. In tier 2 and tier 3 markets, demand 
for immersive retail is rising, particularly in fashion, sports and other tactile categories 
where in-store interactions considerably shape purchase decisions. On the other hand, 
metro cities continue to prioritise experiential beauty retail and seamless convenience in 
everyday essentials such as packaged foods and fresh produce.

While traditional retailers clearly acknowledge the potential of technology to lure 
customers, many stores continue to use digital tools primarily for functional purposes 
rather than for enhancing the in-store customer experience. This highlights the 
opportunities arising from the significant digital gap waiting to be bridged. While AI-driven 
solutions such as recommendation engines and virtual fitting rooms have alleviated 
common online shopping barriers like sizing and fit, brick-and-mortar retailers are yet 
to leverage similar innovations to optimise the generative experience and facilitate a 
seamless, engaging customer journey.  
Despite the demand for in-store interactions, 53% of retail 
stores are yet to implement a technology solution in their 
traditional stores. 
In the apparel industry, consumers 
are now more deliberate, particularly 
with their offline shopping, and 
expect high-quality experiences. With 
the convenience of free returns and a 
willingness to experiment, technology 
will be crucial in determining which 
offerings succeed and which do not.

However, as opportunities to gather insights on consumer profiles and preferences grow, 
brick-and-mortar stores can enhance their customer centricity efficiently by staying 
current with the use of technology. As revealed from our interviews, fast moving consumer 
goods (FMCG) brands are increasingly introducing new products online for quick trials 
before expanding to offline channels across broader regions. Similarly, apparel brands are 
leveraging online consumer data to refine in-store merchandising at a local level.
Therefore, the ability to collect and analyse consumer data allows physical stores to 
optimise their operations, giving them steam to compete with online brands. Also, by 
gauging local consumer preferences, retailers can tailor their in-store product selections 
to better meet the needs of their specific customer base, potentially increasing sales and 
customer satisfaction. The integration of online insights with offline strategies therefore 
underscores the importance of an omnichannel approach, where both digital and physical 
presences complement each other to create a seamless and efficient retail experience.

Q-commerce has firmly established itself in India’s bustling metro cities and tier 1 cities 
driven by the convenience demands of affluent city dwellers. In a study undertaken by 
Kirana Club,8 508 surveyed traditional retailers reported a drop in frequency of customer 
visits to stores and a subsequent drop in foot traffic, which is higher in tier 1 markets and 
across larger store formats. 
Is Q-commerce more common in 
metro cities and tier 1 cities than in 
tier 2 and tier 3 cities?
FMCG brands in metro cities and 
tier 1 areas continue to reach the 
same customer base through 
various channels. Although 
Q-commerce has introduced 
an additional channel, it hasn’t 
significantly expanded the 
customer base. The anticipated 
growth for these brands is likely 
to come from deeper market 
penetration in rural parts of India.

Note: Kirana stores – the backbone of India’s neighbourhood shopping — are facing a new wave of disruption. 
To understand how Q-commerce is influencing these retailers, Kirana Club conducted an in-depth research 
to capture insights directly from a diverse mix of 508 traditional retailers across its platform. Read more about 
Kirana club in the Appendix.

On the flip side, Q-commerce’s expansion into tier 2 and tier 3 regions, as per our 
research, reveals a contrasting narrative as non-metro cities’ retailers remain largely 
unpressured by Q-commerce’s entry. The challenges for Q-commerce in tier 2 and tier 3 
areas are manifold – delivery costs soar over greater distances and fragmented demand 
makes inventory management inefficient. Our survey’s findings indicate: 
Q-commerce’s impact on essential categories is significant, with 52% of retailers 
reporting a sales decline in food, beverages and confectionery. This is followed by 
personal care and hygiene (47%) and household cleaning and care (33%).  On the 
other hand, there is minimal impact on niche categories such as childcare, beauty, 
and wellness, which remain least affected. 
Interestingly, prices on notable Q-commerce platforms are at a premium of 
anywhere between 10% to 20% with a plethora of add-on charges. But that’s a 
price affluent urban customers are willing to pay for hyper-fast delivery services, 
prioritising convenience over cost.

In its initial days, e-commerce was driven with pricing as a key utility lever. However, with 
the rise of Q-commerce, the game has now veered towards convenience and impulse 
over pricing.
The quickness of delivery aligns closely 
with the impulsive nature of the category. 
In Q-commerce, customers are more 
focused and intentional, akin to hunting 
rather than grazing. Due to limited 
screen space and product variety, they 
tend to make more decisive choices. So, 
some categories are expected to thrive 
more than others.

20  |    PwC  The retail reinvention paradigm
In our survey 42% of consumer respondents from metro cities 
and tier 1 cities prefer quick delivery for urgent needs, and 
this rise of hyper-fast delivery services has reduced foot traffic 
to physical stores by 28%. 
Q-commerce, understandably so, is synonymous with instant gratification – and 
the ease of skipping checkout line is aligned with consumer expectations of 
convenience-on-demand. Certain product categories are trying to live up to that 
expectation in a nuanced manner. 
In the fashion industry, which 
is highly engaging, we must 
meet customer expectations 
and provide excellent in-store 
experiences. Q-commerce offers 
an opportunity for this industry 
to present merchandise which

The shift to Q-commerce in metro cities and tier 1 cities is intensifying with a few 
prominent e-commerce giants intent on expanding their Q-commerce segment by 
launching 300 to 500 dark stores within this year.9 However, for tier 2 and tier 3 cities, the 
number is muted. Lack of clear return policies and limited assortments may turn out to be 
deal breakers for some consumers. To address these concerns, Q-commerce companies 
have begun to experiment by splitting the orders to a range of dark stores, which in turn 
impacts their lightning speed delivery promise. 
Over 65% of consumers in metro cities and tier 1 use 
Q-commerce to avail of packaged foods, fresh produce and home 
care products. Recent reports highlight that e-commerce giants 
are all set to launch dark stores. 
What is the offline retailers’ recipe for success in 
the new-age digital world?
We have realised that we cannot compete with 
the low prices and discounts offered online. So, to 
add value for our customers, we offer free delivery 
within a 2 km radius until 9pm. Over time, we 
have built strong relationships with our customers, 
and many of them now place their orders through 
instant messaging or phone calls.

Approximately 60% of traditional retailers perceive online shopping as a significant threat 
while 23% believe it has had no impact on their business. However, when assessing 
the actual impact, only 34% of traditional retailers reported experiencing negative 
consequences from the rise of online shopping while 39% were yet to see any impact. 
Thus, the perceived threat may be more of an anticipated risk, rather than one backed 
by substantial evidence. Our research also indicates that direct-to-consumer brands are 
looking to go offline to scale up.
Not all traditional retail stores across categories consider e-commerce as a threat. There 
are those that perceive it as an opportunity to elevate customer service, diversify their 
product offerings and leverage online platforms to expand their reach. For instance, 
28% of apparel retailers and 25% of beauty and personal care retailers perceive online 
shopping as an opportunity to improve product awareness and customer service. Also, 
some retailers are of the view that while digital commerce is growing exponentially, on the 
ground it is not entirely eating into the traditional retail market. Rather, there is a rub-off 
effect wherein different channels, including traditional and modern trade, and e-commerce 
are influencing one other.
According to the survey, 29% of traditional retailers perceive 
online shopping as an opportunity. Moreover, 27% have seen a 
positive impact of online shopping on their business.
Offline retailers, perception of online shopping is more an 
apprehension than a threat for the time being.

Survey findings indicate 60%  of traditional retailers believe 
improved access to technology can empower them to enhance their

The landscape of brick-and-mortar retail is poised for reinvention as digital commerce 
continues to disrupt traditional models. While the rise of online shopping presents 
challenges, it also offers a unique opportunity for brick-and-mortar retailers to level the

system, inventory management software – could empower them to compete effectively 
against digital platforms, highlighting how digital tools can be harnessed as powerful allies 
rather than threats. Amidst this disruption, ONDC remains an under-the-radar revolution, 
with limited awareness among retailers and consumers. 
Brands and traditional retailers believe integrating AI-driven analytics and mobile 
applications can enable them to understand customer preferences better and tailor 
their offerings, accordingly, making it an interactive experience with human touchpoints. 
Further, a data-driven approach could also help them enhance their ability to compete 
with online platforms by offering competitive prices and targeted promotions.

Flexible return policies (40%), efficient after-sales service (39%), 
and better payment options (39%) top the list of consumer 
priorities.
For consumers, hassle-free shopping and post-purchase support are important. 
When deciding to visit offline stores more frequently, they often prioritise assortment, 
convenience and the overall purchase experience over pricing and discounts. After-
sales service (39%) is important for tier 2 and tier 3 cities (41%), reflecting the need 
for continued retailer support beyond the initial purchase. Product variety (31%) and 
availability with improved stock levels (37%) are also important factors. Additionally, 
running a monthly credit facility (36%) remains an important feature, especially in 
local markets where retailer-consumer relationships are stronger. Thus, brick-and-

assortment, convenience and the experience of shopping as a therapeutic, social activity 
to be indulged in with friends and family.

It may also be noted that despite ONDC’s potential to empower retailers in competing 
against e-commerce giants, awareness of the platform remains low. This disparity 
suggests that the platform has not yet achieved the level of adoption necessary to

Implications of  
the research
3
The rise of e-commerce has led to an urgent need for retailers to change their 
traditional ways of operating. Some of the important aspects which retailers must 
understand in order to adapt to this change are: 
These findings indicate that the future of retail is about blending the traditional and 
modern, tactile and digital, natural and artificial. A shift towards generative, immersive 
and engaging retail experiences is not just inevitable but indispensable, especially when it 
comes to traditional retail. It is what the consumers are demanding. If traditional retail is to 
remain relevant, it needs to reinvent itself into a trending service, an immersive experience 
which is dynamic yet personal, and humanly engaging yet technically elevating. 
 
Social media and influencer culture also have a role to play amidst the tangible value 
being generated. Influencers spark trends on platforms, share product reviews and create 
seamless shopping experiences through embedded links. This digital ecosystem fosters 
two-way conversations making the buyer’s journey more interactive and personalthan 
ever before.
•	
The omnichannel retail experience in India is a work in progress. For personal 
products, online shopping is the preferred choice while the offline mode works best 
for family-related products demanding tactile, sensory engagement. Be that as it may, 
consumers still prefer a combination of online and offline channels.
•	
Proactive technology application could be a gamechanger for traditional retail stores 
and could increase their competitiveness.
•	
With the rise of Q-commerce, the game has now veered towards impulse over 
pricing, and some e-commerce companies are set to launch dark stores to expand 
their Q-commerce segment.
•	
While traditional retailers perception of online shopping as a threat is higher than 
the actual threat it may pose, some of them actually perceive online shopping as 
an opportunity, and 27% have seen a positive impact of online shopping on their 
businesses.
•	
Only 4% of traditional retailers are familiar with ONDC and a mere 1% are actively 
accepting orders through the platform.
35  |    PwC  The retail reinvention paradigm
01
Omnichannel retail success is 
greater than the sum of its parts 
implies
Following are some of the implications of the research:
Consumers crave for the best of both 
worlds: Nearly half of the consumers who 
participated in the survey still crave the 
best of both worlds – the convenience 
of online browsing and the tactile joy of 
in-store experiences. For some sectors, 
consumers prefer to shop on their terms 
– effortlessly hopping between screens 
and aisles, but for others click and buy 
without a certain level of trust fails to work. 
Here, the in-person experience remains 
king. Thus, the future entails a hybrid 
‘offline + online’ model creating a seamless 
shopping journey in a complementary 
ecosystem where each channel enhances 
the other. 
Retailers who focus on leveraging this 
relationship will thrive, while those that 
resist the evolution risk being left behind. 
They need to carve out experiences which 
let customers move seamlessly between 
the virtual and the tangible. Therefore, the 
perception of online shopping as a threat, 
rather than a challenge to be leveraged, 
may soon be a thing of the past. 
36  |    PwC  The retail reinvention paradigm
02
Q-commerce is more common in 
metro cities and tier 1 cities than 
in tier 2 and tier 3 cities
Slow uptick of Q-commerce in tier 2 and 
tier 3 cities augurs well for the kirana 
stores: The promise of hyperlocal fulfillment 
works well in cities with consistent 
demand. But outside metro cities, 
Q-commerce becomes a costly challenge. 
Without a steady stream of orders, the 
cost of hyperlocal inventory and quick 
delivery options becomes unsustainable, 
turning the model into a financial strain. 
Thus, the demand fragmentation creates 
significant operational friction — delays, 
high per-order expenses — and profitability 
takes a hit. The unpredictability of demand 
for certain products like fresh produce 
or essential home care items can create 
significant challenges in stocking including 
longer holding times, higher levels of 
wastage and inefficiencies in inventory 
planning leaving the model unsustainable 
outside of metro cities and tier 1 cities . 
    
Here is where traditional retailers, which 
are more than just neighbourhood shops, 
can be a gamechanger. As the backbone 
of community retail in tier 2 and tier 3 
cities, they could soon become digital-first 
warriors in their markets, offering the speed 
and convenience that customers demand, 
but with a personalised, community-
based touch. Their personal connection 
with consumers, deep understanding 
of local needs and the ability to serve 
small, often overlooked, markets can give 
them an edge in the era of Q-commerce. 
Therefore, by digitising inventory and 
adopting lean, hyperlocal delivery models, 
these stores can achieve a similar agility 
and convenience, minus the heavy 
infrastructure costs.

Retailers need a well-defined roadmap in the new-age  
digital world
Brick-and-mortar retail reinvention
Retailers need to move out of their comfort zone and clue into the online trend 
movements to up their game: While the prevalence of technology is becoming a must 
in retail, there is still a psychological resistance to integrating advanced technologies in 
physical stores. Retailers often feel overwhelmed or uncertain about how to implement 
these tools effectively, especially when the benefits are not immediately clear. A key 
challenge is the fear of change — many retailers still prioritise traditional customer service 
methods because they are familiar and perceived as low-risk. The hesitation to adopt 
innovation comes from a fear of alienating customers who may not be comfortable with 
too much digital interference.
  
Getting rid of that notion is critical as much as understanding that in the digital realm, 
trends aren’t just quick — they are lightning fast. So, it is a race against the clock across 
all cities. The online platforms landscape has become the trendsetter where something 
can go from obscure to viral in a matter of hours. By the time these trends land in offline 
stores, they are already seasoned, popular and ready to be sold as the next big thing.
 
Thus, to keep up with the ever-changing trends in the digital space, offline retailers need 
to be trend catchers, relying on online movements to inform their in-store strategies. This 
trend underscores the growing reach of e-commerce, as consumers across metro cities, 
tier 1, tier 2 and tier 3 cities access the same brands at similar prices, making online shop-
ping even more appealing. This would also decrease the pressure offline retailers feel and 
enable them to up their game to limit the impact of digital disruption.
Being experiential and tech-centric could be the retailers’ reinvention mantra: 
Retailers are increasingly diversifying their product offerings to counter competition. 
However, the variety offered by e-commerce platforms often surpasses their own 
offerings, thereby limiting the effectiveness of this strategy. Consumer preferences have 
shifted to larger retail formats and towards high brand consciousness across most 
categories. This compels traditional retailers to stock both branded and non-branded or 
less-premium products, impacting their profit margins due to higher inventory costs. 
As expectations continue to rise from physical retail stores to have larger assortment, 
convenient delivery, faster checkouts, generative immersive experiences and digital/social 
engagement, smaller retailers, unable to invest in technology at pace, are likely to look 
at consolidation to survive and thrive. Such consolidation can enable greater reach and 
competitiveness, reduce costs by combining resources and boost business capabilities 
by leveraging strengths of each entity involved.

The discussion in the previous section highlights:
Consumers crave the best of both worlds –  
seamless digital convenience and in-store immersive experience.
Retailers and brands recognise that major trends for their categories are now initiated 
by e-commerce platforms or online marketplaces. As a result, they operate in a reactive 
‘pull mechanism’, fulfilling demand rather than driving it, marking a significant shift from 
their earlier ‘push’ strategies. This shift presents both challenges and opportunities. While 
collaboration with online platforms can drive growth, strategic agility is crucial to balance 
independence and digital integration in an evolving retail landscape.  
The slow uptick of Q-commerce in tier 2 and tier 3 cities  
augurs well for the kirana stores.
Retailers and brands need to move out of their comfort 
zone and clue into the online trend movements to up their 
game. Being experiential and tech-centric could be an added 
advantage.

Leverage e-commerce for success
Forward-thinking traditional retailers are finding ways to use digital platforms to their 
advantage, with retailers in metro cities seeing greater benefits compared to their tier 2 
and tier 3 counterparts. The largest opportunity comes from increased product awareness 
(72% in metro cities versus 56% in tier 2 and 3 cities), better-informed customers (75% 
versus 50%), and motivation to enhance customer service (74% versus 50%). This 
suggests that metro cities’ retailers are more exposed to digitally savvy consumers, 
prompting them to improve their offerings, while tier 2 and tier 3 city retailers are yet to 
fully capitalise on these shifts. 
However, some opportunities resonate more in tier 2 and tier 3 markets, such as 
wholesalers making bulk purchases online (47%) and easier access to fast-moving 
products (44%), indicating that online platforms help these retailers streamline supply 
chains and stay competitive. Additionally, partnering with online platforms (34%) is lower 
in tier 2 and tier 3 cities, suggesting a need for better integration and support for smaller 
retailers in these regions. Meanwhile, trend visibility through e-commerce (32% in metro 
cities vs. 24% in tier 2 and 3 cities) helps metro cities’ retailers attract customers looking 
for affordable alternatives.
Our recommendation
As digital commerce continues to evolve, traditional retailers who strategically 
integrate online benefits – whether for supply chain efficiency, brand visibility or 
consumer engagement — will be better positioned for long-term success.
Certain categories have a more prevalent 
consumer discovery in the offline channel, 
hence, a robust trio of people, processes and 
technology is extremely important. When the 
trialist becomes a loyalist, the second and 
third purchases are where the channels blur, 
and we need to be present in all platforms and 
channels with a similar value offering. 
– Jafar Jawaid  
Head of Sales | Lotus Herbals  
“
Adopt a flexible, hybrid approach
Our recommendation
The retail industry must cater to evolving consumer needs with a flexible, hybrid approach 
which recognises evolving consumer behaviours, such as the specific demand for both 
personal and family-related shopping experiences. Consumers also want the flexibility of 
researching online and then making the purchase in-store or vice versa.
Several direct to customer or (D2C) companies are also doubling down on their 
omnichannel strategy.10 They are leveraging insights gleaned from online sales to decide 
where to open offline stores and then use their physical presence to gain access to 
a larger consumer base, conduct product trials, have soft launches of offerings, and 
build trust.
Retailers and brands who combine fast, reliable delivery with brick-and-mortar 
shopping experiences can create a strong hybrid model that keeps them relevant in 
the modern retail world.

The Economic Times, Offline stores are trending as new set of D2C firms emerge  
ONDC presents significant opportunities for 
brick-and-mortar retailers, allowing them 
to tap into the online market boom once 
the hurdle of unit economics is cleared out. 
Retailers with an entrepreneurial spirit can 
leverage this platform effectively. Many 
brands are likely to be eager to offer the 
necessary product support if they can 
directly reach and serve customers.
“
Leverage ONDC
Our recommendation
ONDC was set up with the aim to redefine India’s e-commerce landscape by ending 
digital monopolies and creating a level playing field for traditional retailers. However, 
concerted efforts are needed to enhance its visibility, build understanding and incentivise 
adoption else it runs the risk of remaining an underutilised resource rather than becoming 
the transformative tool it was designed to be for the retail sector.
Stakeholders, including government bodies, industry associations and platform 
developers need to focus on creating strategies that effectively communicate the 
ONDC platform’s benefits and encourage widespread engagement among traditional 
retailers. Failure to do so may result in missed opportunities for the very retailers ONDC 
is intended to support.

Flip the script and seize untapped opportunities
Our recommendation
While around 60% of traditional retailers view online shopping as a looming threat, 
29% are seizing it as a golden opportunity to elevate customer service and diversify 
their product offerings. Far from making shoppers impulsive, these savvy retailers see 
e-commerce as a tool for smarter, more informed customers — 66% agreed that the 
digital shopping experience empowers consumers to make well-researched decisions, 
ultimately paving the way for stronger, more meaningful engagement.
Retailers and brands should leverage the advantage offered by some platforms 
which allow them to onboard their products with ease, enabling them to sell 
directly through social media platforms and stores. This ensures that brands stay 
top-of-mind, leveraging the immediacy of social media to engage with customers 
and drive sales in real-time.
43  |    PwC  The retail reinvention paradigm
Focus on generative customer experiences
Our recommendation
Certain product categories have proven that the future of retail lies in creating dynamic, 
personalised and engaging consumer experiences which combine technology with human 
connection. However, most traditional retailers are yet to figure out ways to digitise the 
in-store experience for better product discoverability or brand advocacy. They also have 
the opportunity to collect insights on consumer profiles and preferences to enhance the 
customer experience journey. However, integrating data from both online and offline 
touchpoints can be a struggle for retailers.11 Retailers need to look at adopting advanced 
technological solutions to navigate this. 
Integrate technology to offer virtual product demos or interactive tutorials to help 
customers visualise the product in their homes. This can enhance the shopping 
experience. Engaging with online reviews and listing products on marketplaces 
can also give retailers a wider reach and boost credibility. A comprehensive post-
purchase support system through digital channels can also enhance customer 
satisfaction and loyalty.
Besides allowing the customers their first 
touchpoint with the brand from anywhere, 
anytime, especially for lower tier regions where 
offline store viability is a question mark, digital 
commerce offers brands with aligned values, the 
chance to collaborate and build a community 
that enhances customer experiences. 
 
Driving unique product offerings rooted in the 
right set of values and focus on customer service 
excellence will continue to bring customers to 
stores and, in fact, online and offline channels 
can actually complement each other and grow 
the overall business pie for the brand.

ET Retail, Navigating digital transformation: Retail leaders share key challenges in adopting an omnichannel

Analyse cost-benefit
Our recommendation
Driven by the Q-commerce boom, the demand for dark stores in India, which was at about 
24 million square feet in 2023, is projected to grow at a CAGR of 12% to 37.6 million 
square feet till 2027.12 The critical question, however, remains whether dark stores are 
the next evolution of traditional retail or do they represent a step backward in terms of 
reducing traditional stores’ sales while accelerating the growth of online sales. 
Stores considering the setting up of dark stores need to weigh the set-up and 
operational costs against potential benefits. It is also worth exploring other 
models that may benefit both the local stores struggling with dwindling customers 
and the Q-commerce players grappling with a high cash-burn model.

Moneycontrol, Demand for dark stores touched about 24 million sq ft in 2023. Here’s a deep dive into the 
concept
Outserve rather than outprice online retailers
Our recommendation
Assortment, convenience and purchase experience trumps pricing and discounts 
in online purchases. Traditional retailers need to outserve online retailers rather than 
focusing on outpricing them. Instead of jumping on the bandwagon of free delivery 
and online ordering to replicate digital perks, retailers have an opportunity to stand out 
by offering one-of-a-kind in-store experiences, tailored services or exclusive products 
which can’t be found in the online world.
Offline stores can tap into the therapeutic value of shopping for some 
customers wherein they don’t just shop for products but consider it to be 
more of an interaction where they can enjoy the experience and develop a 
connection. It’s often a shared experience with friends or family which makes it 
much more than just a transaction.
Although e-commerce platforms are shifting consumer 
behaviour from ‘stock up’ to ‘top up’ in urban markets, 
the brick-and-mortar channel is constantly evolving to 
maintain its relevance. Emphasis on home delivery, a 
deep understanding of customer preferences and the 
right assortment of products are all key factors which can 
enable the brick-and-mortar channel to reinvent itself.

PwC India’s retail reinvention 
framework
5
PwC India’s retail reinvention framework provides brands with the ability to visualise how  
consumer utility is driven based on channel choices across different categories and also 
by varying socio economic segment. Brands need to be cognisant of the geographic 
nuances which can impact the utility profile and also tailor their channel actions in line 
with how consumers perceive utility. This will not only help brands to become more 
relevant for their target consumers during decision-making but would also facilitate the 
narrowing down of strategic choices and aid optimal resource allocation for brands. It is 
critical for brands to understand how each consumer cohort perceives utility for a product 
category across the channel choices they make. It is, therefore, important for brands to 
first factor in the following questions of pricing, convenience, variety, engagement and 
experience which gets impacted by the choices made by their target consumer segment. 
The framework measures the utility level across Low, Medium and High levels for each of 
these areas and helps brands arrive at an overall utility score for each of their consumer 
cohorts and channels.

From the illustration above, one can see that the approach of prioritising online channels 
with a sharp focus on driving assortment, product discoverability and engagement levers 
can help the brand in maximising its utility for the Indian Social Economic Classification 
1-6 (ISEC1-6) cohorts.13 Focusing on offline trade availability and tactical price points 
through new packs or offers will induce consumption for the ISEC 11-12 consumers. 
Brands must recognise that the utility balance between consumer segments, the channels 
and the categories is dynamic and evolves with changes in consumer behaviour and 
profile.   The following illustration carries forward the earlier example of the premium 
chocolate. The illustration shows how utility profiles across consumer cohorts shifts 
between channels (online and offline) and how each contributing consumer cohorts 
evolves differently. 
Brands can also use Retail Price Index (RPI - Price to consumer indexed to volume 
of product) as an alternate measure of estimating contribution of consumer cohorts, 
under the assumption that RPI is correlated to the socio-economic demographics of the 
consumer group.
D. Engagement
How well does the consumer 
know about the brand/category 
and is willing to advocate?
How easily can the consumer 
be influenced by external 
opinions to induce trial/repeat?
What is the ability of the 
channel to drive loyalty (with or 
without programs)?
E. Experience
Is the consumer looking for a 
value-added experience in the 
occasion?
Does the purchasing occasion 
add social value to the 
consumers?
Is the purchase decision 
individual or influenced by 
friends/family?

Size of the bubble represents 
contribution of the consumer cohort 
The illustration represents the three distinct consumer cohorts – ISEC 1-6 represents high 
income group, ISEC 7-10 represents medium income group and ISEC 11-12 represents 
low income group. As indicated in the illustration, consumption gradually moves from 
high income to medium and lower income groups, indicating the changing representation 
of the income groups’ consumption profile. Additionally, the utility for all three consumer 
cohorts moves from offline to online channels corresponding with the difference in 
evolving consumer behaviour  across the three consumer cohorts.
Change in consumption patterns shown by the size of the bubble 
(represented by numbers in the circle): the contribution of the high-income 
group for the premium chocolate category drops from 60% to 50% whereas the 
consumption of medium income group moves from 30% to 35% and low-income 
group from 10% to 15%. This is reflective of how with rising income levels and 
evolving needs, consumption patterns have evolved for brands in the premium 
space (i.e. premiumisation).
Change in channel utility: Different consumer cohorts reflect a variation in 
the propensity to find incremental value in online channels. For instance, high 
and medium-income cohorts (ISEC 1-10) grow at a much faster pace in online 
channels compared to the low-income cohort (ISEC 11-12). Therefore, brands 
must align their actions and investments based on this evolution for these two 
cohorts (ISEC 1-10) as they still contribute to the majority of the consumption. At 
the same time, they must recognise that the smallest, yet relatively fast-growing, 
consumer cohort, the low-income cohort (ISEC 11-12), can behave differently 
in comparison to the high- and medium-income groups. As seen from the 
illustration above, inspite of movement towards online channel the utility of low-
income groups stands maximised with offline channels.

Therefore, retail reinvention, is not just about 
adapting to changes but proactively anticipating 
them. Brands could stay ahead of the curve by 
accurately predicting shifting consumer trends 
and strategically aligning their actions with 
specific channel-level shifts. An understanding 
of consumer utility profiles could enable brands 
to predict how they may move with time and 
align their actions in line with these predicted 
changes, These channel-specific actions could 
enable brands to be relevant to consumers as 
their buying preferences and expectations from 
channels evolve. This framework combined 
with a forward-thinking approach can enable 
them to meet evolving consumer expectations, 
enhance their market presence, and, ultimately, 
drive sustained growth in an ever-changing retail 
landscape.
