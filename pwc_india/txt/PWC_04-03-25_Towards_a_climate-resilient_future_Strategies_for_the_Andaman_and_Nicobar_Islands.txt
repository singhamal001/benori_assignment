Foreword 
The Andaman and Nicobar Islands (ANI) stand on the frontlines of climate change, where the impact is both 
immediate and significant. This unique region faces a myriad of challenges – rising sea levels, changing weather 
patterns, increasing temperatures and biodiversity threats – affecting the environment as well as the lives of the 
people in these regions. 
Over the past few years, PwC India Foundation (PwCIF) has actively supported development efforts in the ANI, 
working closely with local communities, government bodies and think tanks to foster sustainable solutions and 
improve quality of life. In our latest study, a collaboration between PwC India and PwCIF, we have conducted 
extensive research and engaged with stakeholders to identify the socio-economic, biophysical and climate-related 
challenges in these islands. Tailored to the adaptation and mitigation needs of the ANI, we have prepared a 
comprehensive climate-resilient action plan comprising viable climate solutions and financing options. 
We extend our gratitude to the many individuals whose invaluable insights have shaped this report. Their 
contribution has been crucial in understanding the complex dynamics at play and enabled us to curate effective 
solutions. As we move forward, our focus will be on implementing these solutions. 
We remain committed to this mission, dedicated to making a measurable impact on the ground. We hope that this

Executive summary 
The ANI are strategically and ecologically significant for India; however, their development has been 
constrained by their geographic isolation. Recent government initiatives have aimed to transform the ANI into 
an economic hub, focusing on infrastructure, trade, commerce and tourism. However, given the islands’ 
ecological sensitivity and vulnerability to climate change, a climate-resilient development approach is essential. 
This report, jointly developed by PwC India and the PwCIF, presents a comprehensive climate-resilient action 
plan that outlines viable climate solutions along with financing options for implementation in the most vulnerable 
regions of the ANI.  
The report is divided into six chapters, which are summarised below: 
Chapter 1: Setting the context 
This chapter establishes the context of the study against the background of ongoing and planned development 
activities in the ANI, along with the ecological, climatic and social vulnerabilities of the islands. It also introduces 
the conceptual framework used to formulate the action plan, which is the IPCC’s Climate-Resilient 
Development Framework from AR6. The action plan is derived from the identified needs in the ANI with the aim 
of fostering broader adaptation and mitigation benefits.  
Chapter 2: Situational analysis 
This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of the ANI’s geographic, ecological and socio-economic 
profile, identifying key challenges and vulnerabilities. An LULC assessment was conducted to analyse changes 
in land use land cover patterns in the ANI over the past two decades.  
The analysis indicated that the ANI has experienced an increase in agricultural activities, particularly 
plantations/orchards and annual crops, while traditional kharif cropping has declined. Evergreen and semi-
evergreen woodlands have decreased, with a corresponding increase in degraded woodlands. Moreover, there 
has been a reduction in littoral, swamp/mangroves and an increase in the minimum spread of water bodies. 
The overall landscape has shifted towards more intensive land use, with significant changes in agricultural 
practices and forest cover. In addition to the LULC assessment, a climate change impact assessment was 
conducted using geospatial analysis of climate indicators such as temperature, precipitation, sea level rise and 
extreme weather events. The results indicated that the ANI’s coastal, marine and forest ecosystems have been 
adversely affected by climate change. These impacts are manifested in various ways, such as degradation of 
soil quality, increased soil erosion, altered water availability, shifts in salinity distribution and nutrient leaching. 
These environmental changes lead to cascading physical, social and ecological repercussions that further 
degrade the ANI’s natural ecosystems. 
Chapter 3: Identifying solutions for addressing vulnerabilities  
This chapter outlines measures to enhance the resilience of local communities and mitigation measures to 
reduce and sequester carbon emissions. A CVI was developed using bio-physical, socio-economic and 
demographic factors to identify the most vulnerable regions in the ANI. Diglipur, Mayabunder and Ferrargunj 
emerged as the most vulnerable sub-districts. Subsequently, the viability of several solutions to address the 
specific vulnerabilities in these sub-districts were assessed. Agroforestry, clean cookstoves, decentralised 
renewable energy, coconut husk biochar and mangrove conservation emerged as the most viable options 
that could be developed into pilot projects for implementation.

Chapter 4: Green finance options 
This chapter examines the financial mechanisms to support the implementation of the climate solutions 
identified in the previous chapter. Green finance options, including impact investment, green bonds, green 
loans, climate finance and carbon markets, were evaluated based on key parameters such as accessibility, 
regulatory flexibility, volatility, returns and scalability. Among these options, carbon markets emerged as the 
most viable choice for financing the climate solutions in Diglipur, Mayabunder and Ferrargunj. 
Chapter 5: Feasibility of carbon markets for pilot intervention 
This chapter shortlists two to three climate solutions from those identified in Chapter 3 based on their feasibility 
for implementation through carbon market financing. The assessment considered factors such as the degree of 
alignment with existing carbon methodologies (e.g. Verra and Gold Standard), estimated emission reductions, 
indicative price/credit, and additionality through alignment with the SDGs.  
Mangrove restoration, clean cookstoves and decentralised renewable energy emerged as the most promising 
solutions, with mangrove restoration standing out due to its significant carbon sequestration potential and 
additional co-benefits. As one of the three main blue carbon ecosystems in the ANI, mangroves present an 
untapped opportunity for the region, which have largely remained unexplored. 
Chapter 6: The way forward 
This chapter summarises the key findings of the report. Mangrove restoration, clean cookstoves and 
decentralised renewable energy were identified as the measures best suited for implementing as pilots in 
Diglipur, Mayabunder and Ferrargunj, with carbon markets as the preferred financing mechanism.  
The next phase of the project will focus on implementing these measures in the identified areas. Key upcoming 
activities include developing detailed project plans for the pilots, securing funding and executing them on 
the ground.

1. Setting the context 
Spread across 8,249 sq. km, with a long coastline of 1,962 km in the Bay of Bengal, the ANI represent a unique 
intersection of geopolitical importance and ecological sensitivity. Geographically closer to Southeast Asia than 
the Indian mainland, the ANI offer a significant locational advantage in the east to India. These islands are 
situated near the Malacca shipping lanes, which serve as key trade routes between Asia, Africa and the Pacific. 
To maximise this geographic advantage, the government has initiated a range of infrastructure projects aimed 
at transforming the ANI into an economic hub for trade, commerce and tourism while promoting socio-economic 
development.1,2,3 
Simultaneously, these islands are characterised by a rich biodiversity and high levels of endemism due to their 
geographic location and isolation. The islands comprise fragile terrestrial, coastal and marine ecosystems that 
provide key ecosystem services and must be preserved. However, these natural resources face increasing 
threats from anthropogenic climate change, including rising sea levels, increasing temperatures and change in 
precipitation patterns. These changes are expected to negatively impact livelihoods, health and infrastructure in 
the ANI. For instance, changes in precipitation may lead to crop loss and reduced agricultural productivity and 
availability of drinking water as residents are primarily dependent on rainwater. Meanwhile, rising average 
temperatures may affect the ANI’s key economic sectors (fisheries, agriculture and tourism) by altering fish 
habitats and spawning, reducing food production due to increased evapotranspiration, heat stress on crops, 
erratic weather and pest attacks. The tourism sector may also suffer as coral bleaching leads to the loss of 
natural attractions. Furthermore, rising sea levels may contribute to coastal erosion, increased storm surges, 
inundation of low-lying areas and saltwater intrusions, thus degrading water resources. The impacts of climate

change not only threaten the ecological balance of the islands but also undermine their economic and social 
resilience, exacerbating existing vulnerabilities and creating new risks. For instance, people in the ANI are 
increasingly vulnerable to climate change-induced diseases such as malaria and dengue, as their prevalence is 
expected to increase with rising temperatures. This risk is further increased by limited healthcare facilities on 
the islands.4 
Within this context of geopolitical and ecological significance and the growing threats posed by climate change, 
a balanced approach towards sustainable development is essential. This approach must incorporate climate-
resilient strategies that protect and preserve the fragile ecosystem while addressing the region’s economic and 
strategic needs. This study has been conducted within this framework with the aim of developing climate-
resilient solutions that support sustainable development in the ANI. 
1.1. About the study 
Objective and conceptual underpinning  
This study uses the lens of the IPCC CRD framework, with the aim of identifying solutions for the ANI that will 
build climate resilience and achieve sustainable development outcomes. CRD is defined as ‘a process of 
implementing greenhouse gas mitigation and adaptation options to support sustainable development for all in 
ways that support human and planetary health and well-being, equity and justice’.5 According to the CRD 
framework, climate action (adaptation and mitigation) and sustainable development are interlinked and cannot 
be effectively achieved in isolation. Adaptation actions enhance social, economic and ecological resilience to 
climate change, thereby supporting sustainable development outcomes. For example, climate-smart 
agricultural practices improve water management, increase water availability, and enhance livelihoods and food 
security. Simultaneously, without mitigation actions, global warming will continue to escalate, worsening climate 
impacts undermining development and limiting effective adaptation options that are available. CRD focuses on 
transforming five interconnected systems: Energy systems, industrial systems, urban and infrastructure 
systems, societal systems, and land, ocean and ecosystems. It also considers socio-economic inequities 
stemming from gender, race or ethnicity, geographic location and poverty to avoid compounding vulnerability to 
climate change and exacerbating injustice.

Methodology 
The study used a comprehensive methodology comprising desk research, data collection, stakeholder 
consultations and data analysis. A literature review was conducted, examining research studies, articles and 
government reports, followed by the collection and analysis of quantitative and qualitative data to identify trends 
and assess the ANI’s landscape. To strengthen the insights, extensive consultations were conducted with a 
range of stakeholders, including central and union-level government agencies, the private sector, development 
agencies and carbon market project developers. These consultations were conducted at different stages of the 
study to gather information and validate findings. In addition, an Advisory Committee (see Acknowledgements) 
consisting of four experts was established to provide critical reviews, direction and insights into the study’s 
findings, enhancing the findings’ robustness. 
A situational analysis was conducted to assess the impacts of climate change and LULC changes. 
Subsequently, the three most vulnerable locations were prioritised using a CVI of socio-economic and bio-
physical factors. Five feasible climate solutions were shortlisted based on two criteria: prior implementation in 
the ANI or presence in existing government policies and programmes in the ANI. Finally, several green 
financing options were assessed, with carbon markets emerging as the most feasible. The study concluded 
with an assessment of the carbon market’s applicability to finance pilot projects, with mangrove restoration, 
clean cookstoves and decentralised renewable energy emerging as the most promising options.

2. Situational analysis 
This chapter provides an in-depth analysis of the ANI’s climate trends and shifts in LULC patterns. It offers a 
comprehensive understanding of the ANI’s natural resource base, the threats to key economic sectors and 
anticipated climate risks. These findings, which form the foundation for the rest of the study, are detailed in the 
following sections. 
2.1. LULC analysis in the ANI 
LULC plays a critical role in the climate system, acting as a source and sink of GHGs.6 Changes in LULC 
patterns modulate the incidence of heatwaves, cold waves, cloud formation and rainfall patterns. Such changes 
can directly and indirectly affect surface temperatures, leading to altered rainfall patterns and thereby droughts 
or floods.7 Meanwhile, climate change, including the increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather 
events, has negatively impacted food security and terrestrial ecosystems and contributed to land degradation 
and desertification. The land ecosystems in the ANI remain highly vulnerable to these ongoing changes and 
extreme weather events.

2.1.1. Current land use patterns 
The ANI have diverse LULC patterns, comprising dense tropical forests, mangroves, coastal wetlands, 
agricultural land and urban settlements. Approximately 86% of the total land area is covered by forests, which 
include tropical evergreen forests, tropical semi-evergreen forests, moist deciduous forests and mangroves.8 
The remaining land is used for agriculture, settlements and other purposes.

2.1.2. Historical changes in land use 
Historical changes in LULC patterns in the ANI have been shaped by natural events and human activities. The 
2004 tsunami in the Indian Ocean significantly altered the coastal landscape, submerging several islands and 
causing substantial loss of mangrove forests. Meanwhile, post-tsunami reconstruction efforts and development 
projects have contributed to increased urbanisation and deforestation in certain areas.

2.1.3. Deforestation and mangrove loss 
Deforestation has been driven by logging, agricultural expansion and infrastructure development. Analysing 
satellite imagery and remote sensing data over the past few decades shows a gradual decline in forest cover, 
impacting the islands’ biodiversity and ecological balance. The presence of mangroves has also rapidly 
declined, with approximately 357 sq. km lost between 1989 and 2021, representing nearly 15% of the total loss 
during this period.10 Coastal development, aquaculture activities and natural disasters such as the 2004 
tsunami have further contributed to mangrove degradation.11,12 Significant changes in LULC patterns are 
observed in the ANI over recent decades, largely driven by natural disasters and human activities.13,14,15 The 
compounded effects of these changes include ecological consequences such as species loss and reduced 
coastal protection, highlighting the urgent need for sustainable management practices in the region 
Figure 3: Mangrove loss

The loss of these forests is linked to species loss, although quantifying the extent of this loss remains 
challenging due to data unavailability. These forests play a crucial role in coastal protection and biodiversity, 
and their degradation has significant ecological implications.

2.2. Climate change impact assessment  
According to the IPCC’s AR6, small islands, including the ANI, are increasingly affected by rising temperatures, 
frequent and intense tropical cyclones, storm surges, droughts, shifting precipitation patterns, sea level rise, 
coral bleaching and invasive species.16 These climatic changes intensify impacts on natural and human 
systems. The ANI are particularly vulnerable as their population and economy rely heavily on climate-sensitive 
sectors such as agriculture, forests, fisheries, tourism and animal husbandry. The AR6 highlights several 
observed impacts and projected risks for small islands, emphasising the urgent need for adaptive measures to 
reduce climate change threats. These threats are detailed below: 
Figure 4: Climate change impacts on the small islands 
 
Source: IPCC AR6 
To assess global climate changes in the context of the ANI, a comprehensive geospatial analysis was 
conducted. The following sections outline the specific climate change impacts to the ANI.

2.2.1. Climate baseline 
The ANI has a tropical climate, warm, moist and equable climate due to its location near the equatorial belt and 
the temperatures ranges from 18°C to 35°C. These islands receive both Northeast and Southwest monsoons, 
with the Southwest monsoon bringing heavy rains from July to September and the Northeast monsoon from 
October to December. The islands receive an average yearly rainfall ranging from 3,000 to 3,500 mm, with 
humidity levels varying between 66% and 85%. Cyclones, accompanied by strong winds, commonly occur 
during the monsoon seasons, particularly in May and November.17 
Figure 5: Rainfall recorded at Port Blair from 2011 to 2022  
 
Source: Directorate of Economics and Statistics, Meteorological Analysis Andaman & Nicobar Islands 2022 
The ANI receive rainfall from the south-west and north-east monsoons. Figure 5 illustrates the variability in 
annual rainfall, reflecting changes in weather patterns and monsoon intensity over the years. Typically, summer 
temperatures range from 28°C to 32°C, with variations from −1°C to +1°C. However, recent trends show that 
temperatures have consistently exceeded the normal range by more than 1°C, aligning with the IPCC 
projections of global warming for small islands. An analysis from 2011 to 2015 showed that minimum 
temperatures were notably above normal in January–February and even higher in March–April. In 2016, 
temperatures spiked sharply, reaching heat wave conditions. Since 2011, the number of very warm days has 
increased, while cold days have declined compared with historical averages.

2.2.2. Climate projections 
Climate models indicate that surface air temperatures will continue to rise across small island regions over the 
next three 30-year period and significant changes in the climate over the coming decades.18 The key 
projections are as follows: 
• 
Temperature: Average temperatures are expected to increase by 1.5°C–2.5°C by the end of the century, 
likely intensifying heat-related stresses on human and natural systems. 
• 
Precipitation: Annual rainfall is projected to increase, but the distribution and intensity of rainfall events 
may become more erratic. The monsoon season is expected to bring heavier downpours, whereas the dry 
season may become even drier. 
• 
Sea levels: Sea levels around the islands are projected to rise by 0.5 to 0.8 m by 2100, posing significant 
risks to coastal areas and low-lying islands.

2.2.3. Climate hazards 
The ANI are highly vulnerable to climate-related hazards. The frequency and intensity of tropical cyclones are 
projected to increase, heightening the risks of storm surges, flooding and wind damage. Rising sea levels, 
combined with intensified storm activity, contribute to accelerated coastal erosion, posing threats to 
infrastructure, settlements and natural habitats. Additionally, the rising sea levels can lead to saltwater intrusion 
into freshwater resources, impacting drinking water supplies and reducing agricultural productivity. 
Figure 10: Cyclone tracks in the last 20 years  
 
Source: NOAA Historical Hurricane Tracks 
The lines on the map represent the cyclone pathways for each recorded year. An assessment of historical 
cyclone tracks over the past 20 years in the ANI indicates that all the islands are highly vulnerable to 
cyclone risk. 
Coastal regions in India such as the ANI, face a risk of inundation due to rising sea levels and annual flooding. 
The National Centre for Coastal Research monitored shoreline changes along the Indian coastline from 1990 to 
2018, revealing that 33.6%, 26.9% and 39.6% of the coastline was vulnerable to erosion, experienced accretion 
and remained stable, respectively.19 The Shoreline Change Atlas indicates that between 1989-91 and 2004-06, 
740.37 km of the Andaman Islands’ shoreline experienced erosion, 944.84 km underwent accretion and 36.83 
km remained stable. The eroded area totalled 17.93 sq. km, while the accreted area covered 27.09 sq. km. As 
for the Nicobar Islands, which have a shoreline length of 777.63 km (excluding the mouths of estuaries, rivers, 
and creeks), 690.10 km experienced erosion, 68.30 km saw accretion and 19.23 km remained stable over the 
same period. The eroded area amounted to 94.72 sq. km, and the accreted area was 0.77 sq. km.20

2.2.4. Sectoral impacts of climate change in the ANI 
Climate change significantly impacts various nature-based sectors in the ANI. Key sectors such as biodiversity, 
agriculture, fisheries and water resources face significant threats from increased temperatures, sea level rise 
and altered precipitation patterns, affecting the ecological balance and livelihoods of local communities. 
Table 3: Climate change impacts on nature-based sectors  
Sectors 
Climate change impacts 
Forest and 
• 
Coral reefs: Rising sea temperatures and ocean acidification pose severe threats to coral 
biodiversity 
reefs, leading to coral bleaching and the loss of marine biodiversity.  
• 
Forests: Changes in temperature and precipitation patterns can alter forest composition 
and health, affecting the habitat of numerous species. 
• 
Mangroves: Mangrove ecosystems are vulnerable to rising sea levels and changes in 
sedimentation patterns, which affect their ability to protect coastlines and support 
marine life.  
Agriculture 
• 
Crop yields: Altered rainfall patterns and increased temperatures can affect crop 
productivity, with potential declines in staple crops such as rice and coconut. 
• 
Pest and disease: Warmer temperatures and changing humidity levels can lead to the 
proliferation of pests and diseases, further threatening agricultural output. 
Fisheries 
• 
Fish stocks: Climate change can affect fish breeding and migration patterns, impacting 
local fisheries due to changes in fish stocks. 
• 
Aquaculture: Increased fluctuations in salinity and temperature can affect productivity 
and health, posing challenges for local communities that are reliant on this sector. 
Water 
resources 
• 
Availability: Changes in precipitation patterns can lead to variability in water availability, 
affecting drinking water supplies and irrigation.  
•

and affecting agricultural practices. 
The ANI are an ecologically sensitive region facing significant challenges due to land use and climate change. 
The geospatial analysis provides critical insights into current state of and historical changes in land use and 
land cover, and the potential effects of climate change. Effective management and conservation strategies are 
essential for protecting the islands’ biodiversity and supporting sustainable development. Policymakers and 
stakeholders must prioritise measures to mitigate climate change impacts, promote sustainable land use 
practices, and enhance community resilience to environmental changes.

2.2.5. Summary of the climate change impacts in the ANI 
The geospatial analysis indicates that the ANI’s coastal, marine and forest ecosystems are being adversely 
affected by climate change. The impacts include soil degradation, increased erosion, altered water availability, 
changes in salinity distribution and nutrient leaching. These environmental shifts lead to a chain of physical, 
social and ecological consequences, which further degrade natural ecosystems in the region. To address these 
challenges, a comprehensive adaptation strategy is required to strengthen community resilience, along with 
mitigation measures to reduce and sequester carbon emissions. Implementing these actions will help address 
the root causes of climate change and protect the natural habitat in the region.

3. Identifying solutions for 
addressing vulnerabilities 
Building on the situational analysis in the previous chapter regarding the changes in LULC, mangrove 
degradation and the heightened risk of climate-related hazards in the ANI, this section focuses on the 
adaptation and mitigation strategies that can be implemented in the most vulnerable areas in the islands, 
aiming to enhance their resilience. Aligned with the CRD framework, the study accounts for equity and justice 
by identifying the most vulnerable locations in the ANI based on socio-economic, demographic and bio-physical 
factors. Targeted solutions were shortlisted for these locations to address their specific challenges. 
3.1. Prioritisation of the vulnerable sub-districts 
Prioritising vulnerable locations is essential for effective climate adaptation planning, especially in an 
ecologically sensitive region such as the ANI. To systematically assess risk, the study developed the CVI, 
which integrates socio-economic and bio-physical vulnerability factors. Socio-economic vulnerability considers 
aspects such as livelihoods, population density and resource access, whereas bio-physical vulnerability 
includes environmental indicators such as LULC changes, biodiversity loss, mangrove degradation, and 
exposure to climate variability and extreme events. By combining these variables, the CVI helps identify the 
sub-districts that are most susceptible to climate impacts. Prioritising these locations is critical for the selection 
of pilot sites where climate resilience strategies can be tested and implemented, laying the groundwork for 
broader regional adaptation efforts.

3.1.1. Socio-Economic Vulnerability Index  
Socio-economic vulnerability is determined by factors such as economic status (wealth, income and poverty), 
education level, housing quality, tenure type, built environment, family structure, age, gender, food insecurity 
and access to insurance.21 These factors play a key role in determining vulnerability and correspond to 
sensitivity in the IPCC vulnerability framework in human systems.22 A high-resolution spatial assessment of 
social vulnerability helps identify possible impact hotspots where adaptation measures are urgently needed.23 
A detailed literature review and an assessment of secondary datasets from the Census of India and the Socio-
Economic Caste Census were conducted. Key aspects of socio-economic vulnerability – household structure, 
gender, education, occupation, socio-economic status, housing and access to basic services – were 
considered during the selection. These variables helped identify socio-economically vulnerable communities 
exposed to multiple hazards. All variables were measured at the interval level. Normalisation of data was 
performed by removing units and converting values into dimensionless units (0–1) using the Human 
Development Index formula.24 After normalisation, the indicators were averaged using simple arithmetic means 
to obtain values for major components, including socio-demographic profile, economic situation, amenities and 
assets. These components were then used to calculate the SEVI.

Based on the SEVI, Diglipur ranks the highest in vulnerability, with a score of 0.70, followed by Nancowry (0.61) 
and Car Nicobar (0.61). These locations face significant challenges related to limited access to amenities, 
economic instability and socio-demographic pressure. Specifically, in Diglipur, the high vulnerability is driven by 
inadequate sanitation, a high proportion of kutcha25 houses and widespread economic hardship. In contrast, 
Port Blair and Ferrargunj record the lowest SEVI scores (0.09 and 0.35, respectively), indicating relatively lower 
socio-economic vulnerability due to better access to amenities, higher income levels and more stable 
household structures. However, even these sub-districts experience issues such as marginalisation and gaps in 
basic infrastructure.

3.1.2. Bio-Physical Vulnerability Index  
Bio-physical vulnerability refers to the susceptibility of natural systems and ecosystems to the adverse impacts 
of climate change and other environmental stressors. In the ANI, this vulnerability is driven by factors such as 
LULC changes, mangrove degradation, climate variability and exposure to extreme events such as cyclones 
and rising sea levels. These islands are ecologically sensitive and geographically isolated, making their bio-
physical systems particularly vulnerable to changes in climate patterns and human activities. Assessing bio-
physical vulnerability is essential for identifying priority areas for conservation and climate adaptation 
interventions, as these factors directly affect the resilience of ecosystems, biodiversity and local livelihoods. 
To assess bio-physical vulnerability at the sub-district level, the study developed the BPVI, focusing on three 
key indicators: LULC changes, mangrove degradation and exposure to extreme events. Each indicator was 
scored on a scale of 0–1 based on secondary research and expert judgement, where 0 indicates low 
vulnerability and 1 represents high vulnerability. The scoring process was informed by secondary data from 
government reports; climate models; biodiversity assessments; and previous studies, with sources including the 
India Meteorological Department, the Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services and peer-reviewed 
literature. A weighted average approach, with equal weights assigned to each indicator, was used to calculate 
the composite BPVI for each sub-district. This methodology enabled systematic comparisons of vulnerability 
levels across sub-districts, providing a robust, data-driven basis for identifying priority areas for climate 
resilience interventions.

The BPVI revealed significant variability in vulnerability levels across the ANI. Sub-districts such as Car 
Nicobar, Nancowry and Great Nicobar exhibited the highest levels of bio-physical vulnerability, with composite 
scores exceeding 0.80. These areas were identified as hotspots for extreme LULC changes, severe mangrove 
degradation, and high exposure to cyclones and rising sea levels. In contrast, sub-districts such as Port Blair 
and Mayabunder demonstrated moderate vulnerability, with index scores ranging from 0.50 to 0.60. The 
findings underscore the critical need for targeted climate adaptation and ecosystem restoration efforts in highly 
vulnerable areas, particularly in the southern regions of the ANI, where biodiversity loss and extreme event 
exposure are most severe. These results offer a clear framework for policymakers in terms of prioritising pilot 
sites for climate resilience and conservation projects. 
3.1.3. Composite Vulnerability Index  
The CVI is a key tool for assessing a region’s overall vulnerability that integrates multiple dimensions, namely, 
socio-economic and bio-physical factors. It provides a comprehensive understanding of how susceptible 
specific locations are to external stressors such as climate change, natural disasters and socio-economic 
challenges. In addition, the CVI incorporates indicators related to socio-demographic profiles, economic 
conditions, infrastructure and environmental degradation, thereby offering a holistic assessment of the region’s 
vulnerability. By integrating socio-economic vulnerability and bio-physical vulnerability, the CVI enables 
targeted decision-making. This index is essential for identifying high-priority areas that require intervention, 
helping policymakers allocate resources effectively and develop sustainable development strategies for 
vulnerable regions such as the ANI.

This radar diagram illustrates the SEVI and BPVI scores for all sub-districts of the ANI. By comparing these 
indices, the diagram highlights areas where socio-economic and bio-physical vulnerabilities contribute 
significantly to the overall vulnerability. This visual representation provides a clearer understanding of regions 
that require increased attention and resources, helping prioritise targeted interventions for areas with 
particularly high SEVI and BPVI scores.

CVI results revealed distinct variations in vulnerability across the sub-districts of the ANI, highlighting the need 
for prioritised interventions. Nancowry and Car Nicobar, with the highest CVI score of 0.74, emerged as the 
most vulnerable sub-districts, followed by Diglipur (0.65). Nancowry and Car Nicobar exhibit a strong 
combination of socio-economic and bio-physical vulnerabilities, with high BPVI scores of 0.87, making them the 
top priority for climate adaptation and resilience-building efforts. Meanwhile, Great Nicobar shows significant 
bio-physical vulnerability but ranks fourth overall due to lower socio-economic challenges. 
While Diglipur (0.65) also shows substantial vulnerability, it should be the next priority, given its balanced 
exposure in both dimensions. Port Blair (0.31) and Ferrargunj (0.475) exhibit lower socio-economic and bio-
physical risks and may be considered low-priority regions but still require targeted interventions to address 
specific vulnerabilities.  
3.2. Socio-economic and demographic profile of vulnerable sub-
districts 
Based on the SEVI, BPVI and CVI, developed using a range of vulnerability indicators, three sub-districts were 
selected in this study, representing high, medium and low vulnerability categories. The selection process 
involved consultations with experts, along with considerations of site accessibility and the feasibility of potential 
interventions. As a result, Diglipur, Mayabunder and Ferrargunj were chosen, each corresponding to a distinct 
vulnerability category. This approach ensures a representative and balanced sample.

3.3. Proposed measures to address vulnerabilities 
Diglipur, Mayabunder and Ferrargunj face varying degrees of vulnerability, exacerbated by socio-economic, 
environmental and climate change factors, as reflected in their CVI scores. To effectively address these 
challenges and enhance resilience within these communities, implementing targeted adaptation and mitigation 
measures is necessary. Based on a literature review and existing government policies and programmes, 
specific measures have been identified to address key challenges in each sub-district. These include 
agroforestry, clean cookstoves, decentralised renewable energy and mangrove conservation and restoration.  
The selected measures have been implemented in similar contexts, demonstrating their feasibility and 
effectiveness. Additionally, their alignment with government policies and programmes ensures they support 
broader strategic goals and national priorities. These measures aim to reduce vulnerabilities, enhance 
livelihoods and promote sustainable development in the three sub-districts.

Decentralised renewable energy (DRE)41 
DRE-based solutions can help supplement household energy needs, reducing 
dependence on diesel-generated grid electricity and kerosene. DRE solutions 
have been shown to improve quality of life and support local economic activities. 
This measure also contributes to reducing GHG emissions and aligns with 
national priorities for sustainable energy access.

The proposed measures identified and their justification 
Mangrove conservation and restoration42 
The conservation and restoration of mangroves is crucial for coastal protection, 
biodiversity conservation and carbon sequestration. Conserving and restoring 
mangroves can mitigate the impacts of extreme climate events such as storms 
and tsunamis, reducing climate vulnerability. Mangroves also support fisheries 
and other livelihoods, enhancing food security and economic stability. This 
measure aligns with efforts to combat biodiversity loss and promote sustainable 
development in coastal areas. 
Coconut husk biochar43 
Coconut husk biochar projects offer socio-economic and environmental benefits, 
including job creation in rural areas, from the collection and processing of coconut 
husks to the distribution and sale of biochar. This initiative can transform 
agricultural waste into a value-added product that generates additional income for 
farmers and producers. Biochar also serves as an alternative to firewood while 
sequestering carbon, contributing to climate change mitigation.

4. Green finance options 
Green finance has emerged as a crucial mechanism for mobilising financial resources for climate action. It 
encompasses a range of financial instruments and strategies designed to support projects that deliver 
environmental benefits. These instruments facilitate the transition to a low-carbon economy while attracting 
investments aligned with the SDGs. Green financing can enhance access to environmentally friendly goods 
and services, particularly for vulnerable communities, promoting socially equitable growth. Consequently, 
increased investments in businesses through green finance helps them adopt more sustainable practices, 
leading to job creation and economic growth as well as reduced carbon emissions. 
Projects funded through green finance typically include renewable energy and energy efficiency, pollution 
prevention and control, biodiversity conservation, circular economy initiatives, and the sustainable use of 
natural resources and land.44 
4.1. Assessment of the feasible financing options 
Green finance options are diverse, with each offering distinct mechanisms to support environmentally beneficial 
projects. These instruments, which include green bonds and loans and investment and climate funds, 
collectively drive the transition towards sustainability. While each option presents unique advantages and 
challenges, all of them play vital roles in mobilising financial resources to combat climate change and promote 
sustainable development.

Among the green finance mechanisms analysed, carbon markets stand out as a dynamic and scalable 
solution, offering direct financial incentives for emission reduction while fostering innovation across 
industries. Carbon markets mobilise larger volumes of capital compared with the other finance instruments. As 
the global focus on sustainability intensifies, strategically deploying green finance mechanisms will be critical in 
achieving long-term environmental and economic goals. The next chapter explores the feasibility of using 
carbon markets to finance the five measures identified for the three most vulnerable sub-districts in the ANI.

5. Feasibility of carbon markets 
for pilot interventions 
Building on the potential of carbon markets, as discussed in the previous chapter, this chapter examines their 
practical application in the ANI. It assesses the feasibility of leveraging carbon markets to finance proposed 
measures in Diglipur, Mayabunder and Ferrargunj. The analysis aims to identify the most suitable measures for 
carbon market financing and their implementation as pilot projects. 
5.1. Assessing the applicability of carbon markets 
To determine the suitability of the proposed measures for carbon markets, project activities were evaluated 
against the eligibility criteria of relevant methodologies, additionality and baseline conditions. The key findings 
from this assessment are summarised below. 
5.1.1. Agroforestry 
The proposed project activity was assessed against Verra’s VM0047 Afforestation, Reforestation and 
Revegetation45 as well as Gold Standard’s Methodology for Afforestation/Reforestation (A/R) GHG Emission 
Reduction and Sequestration,46 as these methodologies are the most relevant for agroforestry/afforestation, 
reforestation and revegetation (ARR) activities. The assessment indicates that most applicability conditions are 
expected to be met or can be ensured during the project design stage. However, as Diglipur, Mayabunder and 
Ferrargunj are coastal regions, project activities must carefully account for tidal wetlands (including 
mangroves) and organic soils in wetlands. If these conditions apply, the activities may not be eligible 
under these methodologies.

5.1.2. Clean cookstoves 
The proposed project activity was assessed against Verra’s VM0050 Energy Efficiency and Fuel-Switch 
Measures in Cookstoves,47 as well as Gold Standard’s Methodology on Reduced Emissions from Cooking and 
Heating: Technologies and Practices to Displace Decentralized Thermal Energy Consumption (TPDDTEC)48 as 
these methodologies are the most relevant for activities involving the distribution of improved cookstoves in 
communities. The assessment indicates that applicability conditions are expected to be fulfilled or can be 
ensured during project design. No specific barriers have been identified for the three shortlisted sites at 
this stage. 
5.1.3. DRE 
The proposed project activity was assessed against the Verra-approved CDM AMS-I.L. Electrification of rural 
communities using renewable energy.49 This small-scale methodology is well-suited to activities that may 
involve the implementation of renewable energy projects such as rooftop solar photovoltaic systems in rural 
communities to reduce fossil fuel use. An assessment of the proposed measure against this methodology 
indicates that the applicability conditions are expected to be fulfilled or can be ensured during the project 
design stage.  
However, the grid-connected status of households in the baseline scenario must be carefully considered, as 
this methodology applies to cases where consumers were previously unconnected to the national or regional 
grids and are now supplied with electricity from the project activity. It also covers situations where a fraction of 
consumers previously powered by a fossil fuel mini-grid are now supplied with electricity from the project.  
5.1.4. Mangrove restoration 
The proposed project activity was assessed against Verra’s VM0033 Methodology for Tidal Wetland and 
Seagrass Restoration as well as Gold Standard’s Methodology on Sustainable Management of Mangroves as 
these methodologies50 are typically used for mangrove restoration projects. The former replaced the CDM 
methodologies AR-AM0014 (Afforestation and reforestation of degraded mangrove habitats) and AR-AMS0003 
(Afforestation and reforestation project activities implemented on wetlands) in 2022. An assessment against 
these methodologies indicated that that the applicability conditions are expected to be fulfilled or can be 
ensured during the project design stage. No specific barriers are expected for the three shortlisted sites.  
5.1.5. Coconut husk biochar 
The proposed project activity was assessed against Verra’s VM0044 Methodology for Biochar Utilization in Soil 
and Non-Soil Applications51 as well as Puro Earth’s Biochar Methodology52 as these are typically used for 
biochar projects. An assessment against the aforementioned methodologies indicated that that the applicability 
conditions are expected to be fulfilled or can be ensured during the project design stage.

However, local use of biochar for agricultural productivity may be limited, as croplands and plantations cover 
only 3% of the ANI’s total area. Additionally, the transportation of biochar over long distances may not comply 
with the applicability conditions of the two methodologies.  
5.2. Estimated carbon credits for the proposed solutions in the 
pilot site(s) 
This section presents the estimated ERs and indicative carbon credit revenue expected from each proposed 
measure. Where sub-district-level data are available, ERs and revenue calculations have been conducted for 
the shortlisted sites. 
5.2.1. Agroforestry 
An assessment of Indian agroforestry/ARR projects registered on Verra was conducted to provide an indicative 
range of ERs per hectare per year. Table 11 presents the list of projects along with their associated ERs:

per annum. 
Based on 2011 Census data,57 firewood remains a significant source of fuel for cooking across Diglipur, 
Mayabunder and Ferrargunj. Assuming the project activity involves deploying ICS across 5% of the households 
dependent on firewood, Table 13 presents the expected ERs per annum and indicative revenue may be 
expected from the shortlisted sites.

Based on the 2011 Census, grid-connected electricity and kerosene are significant energy sources for lighting 
needs across the three shortlisted sites (Table 14). While these households may be connected to the grid, 
continuity of electricity access remains a likely issue. Additionally, most grid-connected power generation in 
these areas relies on diesel, which is not a sustainable source of electricity. Therefore, DRE presents a viable 
alternative, offering a more reliable and sustainable power source.

5.2.4. Mangrove restoration 
Mangroves are widely known for their high carbon stocks per hectare, with these coastal ecosystems 
sequestering carbon at a rate 10 times greater than mature tropical forests.62 Mangroves globally store around 
8.5 Gt of carbon, highlighting their significance as key carbon sinks or potential sources of emissions if not 
properly conserved.63  
An assessment of mangrove restoration projects listed on Verra was conducted to estimate ERs per hectare 
per year. Given the limited number of projects registered in India, the scope was expanded to include global 
projects. Table 16 presents the list of projects along with their estimated ERs.

This yielded an average value of 39 ERs per ha per annum. Given that mangrove restoration projects are 
priced at an average of USD 24 per credit,64 this translates to an indicative revenue of USD 936 per ha per 
annum. Notably, the specific project area (in ha) at the three shortlisted sites is currently unavailable through 
secondary research; therefore, the total expected credits per site have not been calculated. The variation in 
estimates between the projects may be due to differences in species and geographic conditions. Based on the 
above-registered projects in India, mangrove restoration activities may generate an indicative revenue of USD 
278 per ha per annum. 
5.2.5. Coconut husk biochar 
The use of biochar can generate carbon credits in the range of 1.5–3 tCO2e per tonne of biochar depending 
on feedstock type.65 Other influencing factors include biochar composition (carbon percentage, bulk density and 
dry weight) and fossil fuel consumption during biomass processing or biochar production.66 Based on this 
range, indicative revenues fall between USD 245–495 per tonne, according to Puro Earth’s Biochar Price 
Index, which estimated a result of EUR 158 per tonne as of November 2024 (approximately USD 165).67

5.3. Final measures for implementation as a pilot 
The assessment of the proposed activities, namely, agroforestry, clean cookstoves, DRE, mangrove restoration and coconut husk biochar, against relevant 
methodologies, indicated that applicability conditions are expected to be fulfilled or can be ensured during the project design stage. Therefore, from a methodological 
point of view, no major feasibility challenges are anticipated across these five measures.  
An indicative carbon credit assessment was conducted for each proposed measure; however, site-specific data were only available for the clean cookstove project. As 
part of the pilot projects, the collection of primary data is necessary to accurately determine the carbon market potential of the proposed activities. 
As summarised in Table 17, mangrove restoration, clean cookstoves and DRE emerge as particularly promising options among the five proposed measures, 
considering credit price and SDG alignment. Mangroves in India have declined by almost 15% between 1989 and 2021.68 Carbon financing can play a key role in 
reversing this trend by providing funding and incentives for large-scale mangrove restoration projects, supporting carbon sequestration, coastal resilience and biodiversity. 
Additionally, the ANI’s dependence on the mainland for energy security, along with its reliance on diesel-based power, highlights the need for sustainable energy 
solutions. DRE systems could reduce this dependence, providing more stable, sustainable and secure energy for the shortlisted sites. Finally, the reliance on firewood for 
cooking means that clean cookstoves can be a viable solution in the shortlisted sites, and their inclusion in India’s Article 6.2 whitelist of 14 technologies offers an 
additional advantage in attracting international finance to enhance climate mitigation efforts in India.

6. The way forward 
This study presents a climate-resilient development model for the ANI, integrating adaptation and mitigation 
actions. The broad aim is to foster socio-economic development while addressing the pressing challenges 
posed by climate change. Based on the regions that faced the most significant socio-economic, climatic and 
biodiversity-related challenges, we identified the most vulnerable locations in the ANI and finalised three 
measures – mangrove restoration, clean cookstoves and DRE – for pilot project development. Finally, we 
narrowed down on carbon markets as a key financing mechanism for implementing the proposed measures. 
Among these solutions, mangrove restoration stands out due to its high carbon sequestration potential and 
additional co-benefits. As one of the three main blue carbon ecosystems in the ANI, mangroves offer largely 
unexplored opportunities in the region. In this regard, carbon markets can serve as a key financing tool, 
leveraging the high sequestration potential of mangroves while addressing the high costs associated with such 
a restoration project.  
Our interactions with experts led to the emergence of several key points, clarifying the criticality of financing 
measures for implementing carbon market projects. Indian corporates have shown interest in investing in 
carbon market-related projects, particularly in mangrove conservation and restoration due to their niche credit 
nature. However, concerns about credit quality have made them hesitant to invest heavily. While CSR funding 
is a potential avenue for funding, it is often limited and insufficient for high-cost initiatives such as mangrove 
restoration and agroforestry. Additionally, companies in India prefer directing CSR funds towards geographies 
where they have an operational presence or footprint, unlike international companies, which are investing 
significantly in carbon- and nature-based solutions.

To attract investors, it is essential to develop a strong business case that clearly defines the project scope, 
funding schemes and revenue projections to provide a clear understanding of the project and the timeline for 
returns on investment. Baseline condition assessments are crucial for determining the projects’ economic 
viability. Clear implementation structures, such as involving non-governmental and farmer producer 
organisations in addressing on-ground challenges, along with digital monitoring systems to maintain carbon 
credit quality and value, are necessary. Large-scale implementation is critical for maximising carbon credits and 
ensuring the projects’ viability. Challenges such as land ownership, particularly in mangrove restoration and 
agroforestry, require site-based, micro-level assessments as a key next step. 
In the next phase, this study’s findings will guide the implementation of pilot initiatives in vulnerable locations in 
the ANI and the development of a carbon market project covering mitigation and adaptation. It will also explore 
private and public funding sources. It will involve two strategic components: Implementing measures through 
pilot projects and developing the carbon market project. Key activities in the implementation phase of the pilot 
projects will include identifying implementation partners, selecting sites, engaging with communities and other 
stakeholders, conducting site-specific assessments and exploring the feasibility of technical and financial 
assistance from development agencies. Likewise, for the carbon market project, the next steps will include 
developing a comprehensive PDD, securing third-party validation of the PDD to ensure compliance with carbon 
standards, registering the project and issuing carbon credits.
