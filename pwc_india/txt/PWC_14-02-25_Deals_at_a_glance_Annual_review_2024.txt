Indian economics saw a mixed performance in 2024. India’s gross domestic 
product (GDP) growth slowed down to 5.4% in Q2 FY25 from 6.7% in Q1 
FY25. This was affected by factors like slowdown in capex, weak consumption 
growth, decrease in investment and lower growth in exports. This was 
compensated by private and government consumption. We saw an increase in 
foreign direct investment (FDI), with India is shaping up as the fastest-growing 
G20 economy, with a 7% growth rate in 2024 driven by robust domestic 
demand. By 2040, India aspires to become the second-largest economy by 
leveraging government initiatives, infrastructural developments, improved ease 
of doing business and young, skilled workforce working in its favour.
As we look forward to 2025, the shifting dynamics and evolution of the 
economic and deal factors will be important, and we remain optimistic about 
2025 being the year to initiate the path to sustainable progress with India 
becoming a top choice for global investors.
With a 42% increase in overall transactions, 2024 was a year of revival following the corrections in 2023. Merger 
and acquisitions (M&A) witnessed 52% increase while there was a 34% rise in private equity (PE) investments. The 
combined disclosed deal value reached an impressive USD 112 billion which can be attributed to a 67% jump in the 
number of deals valued over USD 1 billion.
We observed a prominence of domestic deals within M&A which constituted about 70% of the volume. This makes the 
market consolidation efforts more evident within the domestic landscape. The retail and consumer sector led in terms 
of transaction volume, while non-power infrastructure had the highest deal value, with tech and innovation playing a 
pivotal role amongst all the top sectors – be it e-commerce, FinTech or advancements in biotech.
Another space that drew the limelight was India’s credit growth trajectory that remained positive, with activity in real 
estate sector and advancements in deal structuring while Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) saw significant 
progress with regulatory amendments.

Market snapshot
In 2024, deals in India experienced a significant uptick 
in both M&A deals and PE investments, in terms of both 
volume and disclosed deal value after 2023, the year 
of corrections.
The total number of deals announced in 2023 was 1,839 
which grew 42% in 2024 to 2,606. M&A transactions saw 
a rise of 52%, while PE transactions grew by 34%. On the 
other hand, the total disclosed deal value for M&A surged to 
a significant 81%, to USD 71.5 billion, while PE deals value 
saw a modest 11.7% increase to USD 40.2 billion, making 
the combined disclosed deal of USD 111.7 billion. This is 
48% higher than the previous year, reflecting an overall 
stronger confidence on the market and a specific focus on 
long synergies through the way of strategic realignments 
favouring M&A. 
In Q4 2024, the total volume for deals was 646, with a 
combined deal value of USD 27.8 billion. While M&A 
value decreased from Q3, PE saw a substantial increase, 
signaling an improved outlook for the PE space. The overall 
deal volume in Q4 2024, although lower than the peak in 
Q1 2024, provided a strong finish to the year. M&A volume 
almost doubled as compared to Q4 in 2023, echoing the 
yearly trend of focusing on strategic transactions. The total 
transaction volume and disclosed deal value of this quarter 
had a slight decline from Q3 CY24 but remained well above 
the quarterly numbers of 2023.
Notably, the total M&A deals in 2024 constituted about 
70% domestic deals as opposed to 63% in 2023. This 
increased preference for domestic transactions underscores 
a strategic focus on consolidating market share and 
expanding the business within the existing markets. The 
quarterly trend shows that Q1 2024 had the highest number 
of domestic transactions at 225, followed by a slight decline 
in Q2 to 185. The numbers stabilised in Q3 and Q4, at 214 
and 213, respectively, suggesting increasing importance 
of domestic growth and integration, largely steered by 
the economic conditions and strengthening local market 
positions. Inbound deals followed a similar trend. On the 
contrary, outbound deals showed an upward trajectory, with 
35 deals in Q1, followed by a steady rise to 37 in Q2, 49 in 
Q3 and peak at 51 in Q4.
The average ticket size for M&A transactions came down 
to USD 91 million from USD 100 million in 2023, observing 
a dip of 9%. On the other hand, the average PE ticket 
size dropped 26% from USD 46 million to USD 34 million. 
Looking at the quarterly trend, Q4 2024 saw M&A average 
ticket sizes dropping aggressively to USD 68 million from 
USD 116 million, but the PE ticket size still increased to 
47% to USD 37 million from USD 25 million in Q3 CY24, 
showing a stark contrast with the overall trend.

Top sectors
The retail and consumer sector witnessed the highest deal 
volume with 418 transactions with a total value of USD 9.9 
billion. This comes as no surprise as we saw the same trend 
in 2023 and throughout 2024 as well. Although the deal 
volume of non-power infrastructure sector was low with 
only 69 deals, it stands out with the highest deal value of 
USD 10.3 billion with two deals above USD 1 billion.
Technology sector followed with 352 deals with a value of 
USD 6.3 billion, highlighting its importance and significant 
role in innovation and digital transformation across 
industries. All the top sectors in the market have technology 
as an integral part, such as e-commerce in retail, MedTech 
and biotech in healthcare and pharma or FinTech as a 
whole. Within these, private equity deal activity experienced 
fluctuations, with significant investments directed towards 
high-growth sectors like technology and infrastructure. 
Healthcare sector saw 183 deals with a value of USD 
5.3 billion. This is driven by advancements in medical 
technology and increased emphasis on health. Healthcare 
and pharmaceutical sectors are poised for transformative 
growth, potentially doubling market size in the next 5–7 
years, steered by digital adoption and innovation and 
increased R&D.
The financial sector, a combination of both traditional 
as well as FinTech, remains active, showing signs of 
consolidation and expansion strategies coupled with 
smaller, disruptive innovations within financial technology. 
Traditional companies are also venturing into the FinTech 
space in order to compete in the market. Oil and gas 
recorded the lowest deal volume but still achieved a 
significant value of USD 6 billion, suggesting few but large, 
capital-intensive projects.
Sector watch
Large deals
There are 19 deals exceeding USD 1 billion, accounting 
for 34% of the total disclosed deal value. About 25% 
of the total disclosed deal value comes from the top 
10 deals alone. 
It is interesting to notice that the top 10 transactions were 
all M&As, with three specifically being mergers.
The largest deal of the year comes from the oil and gas 
sector, where Gujarat State Petronet and Gujarat State 
Petroleum Corp merged into Gujarat Gas. This was followed 
by a deal from the media and entertainment sector, where 
Reliance Industries and Disney formed a joint venture 
by merging the businesses of Viacom 18 and Star India 
creating a media giant across TV broadcasting, streaming, 
movies and sports.
Overview and outlook
M&A in 2024 focused on consolidation and integration of 
tech, particularly in infrastructure and renewable energy. 
The outlook is promising with expectations for continued 
activity in cement, renewables, consumer and pharma 
sectors in 2025. Industrials market is anticipated to grow, 
fueled by strong corporate balance sheets and global 
supply chain reorganisation, and a focus on electrification 
and decarbonisation. We foresee considerable capital 
targeting large deals in e-commerce, renewable energy, 
technology and healthcare, emphasising on sustainability 
and ESG factors.

Nifty 50 index showed a growth of about 9% year-on-year 
(YoY), exhibiting the strength of the Indian market over the 
year, while S&P 500 showed an even larger growth of about 
23%. This brings to light a strong global investment climate, 
with the global indices performing particularly well.

Looking at the last quarter closely reveals a much weaker

India’s credit growth landscape has garnered the interest of many recently. In 2024, it saw 
transactions of about USD 10 billion and an average deal size of USD 29 million. Out of 
the 230 deals seen this year, 114 were less than USD 10 million. Private credit has also 
seen huge growth over the past decade globally, becoming an important component of 
the market. 
•	
In 2024, India saw some strong credit investments, more so in the real estate sector. This 
alone made up 28% of the total deal volume, followed by investments in utilities sector 
(15.7%) and infrastructure (10.7%). Additionally, there was interest in other sectors as 
well such as renewables, healthcare and pharmaceutical. In 2023, private credit funds 
predominantly focused on real estate, accounting for about 29% of the total deal volume, 
followed by sectors like metals and mining, and utilities.​
•	
This year not only saw private credit as an upcoming option but also marked a year full of 
advancements in deal structuring. This was characterised by complex high-yield offerings, 
flexible structures with redemption premiums and performing credit. Considerable 
participation was seen from non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) and family offices, 
in addition to the private credit funds in the private credit space. 
•	
Domestic funds exhibited an increased interest, showing significant activity in 2024 as 
compared to 2023. This is an effort to enhance their market share as compared to the 
offshore funds.

India’s growing private credit landscape
Initiatives and future path for 
insolvency by IBBI
Emerging challenges and institutional 
improvements in insolvency
Outlook
The IBC has evolved and improved constantly, with 2024 
being no exception. This year, the Supreme Court of India 
gave clarity on several issues like statutory set-off not 
being applicable to the Corporate Insolvency Resolution 
Process (CIRP) except in specific cases. There was high 
emphasis on ‘substance over form’. There was also a 
distinction between arbitration and insolvency applications 
with different remedies. The court also ruled that the ‘right 
to maintenance’ is superior to creditor claims and that IBC 
should not override statutes like slum redevelopment. The 
high courts confirmed that the National Company Law 
Tribunal (NCLT) cannot override other courts in any  
non-insolvency matters.
In 2024, Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI) 
focused highly on the continuous improvement and 
outcome measurement of the insolvency framework 
currently present in India. A central auction platform was 
introduced, in addition to releasing discussion papers 
and regulatory amendments. This allowed the role of 
Insolvency Professional Entities (IPEs) to expand and 
mandated meetings in personal guarantor insolvencies. 
The liquidation regulations led to enhanced oversight, 
monthly meetings and a director’s certification in case of 
voluntary liquidations.
The discussion papers released by IBBI proposed 
standardisation of progress reports, self-certification for 
auction bidders and voluntary liquidation with uncalled 
capital if the creditors’ interests are secure. Further, 
suggestions included mediation for the operational 
creditors, rationalising the valuers and simplifying the 
complete micro, small and medium enterprise (MSME) 
insolvency process. IBBI is expected to adopt many of the 
proposals, including group insolvency and potential out-
of-court mechanisms in 2025, but cross-border insolvency 
may remain territorial unless benefits justify the proposed 
change. We might have further clarity on unresolved issues 
like dissenting financial creditors’ rights and distribution 
mechanisms in insolvency waterfalls later in the year.
With all the recent changes, there are chances of some 
new legal challenges rising on account of the Digital 
Personal Data Protection Act 2023, specifically regarding 
data valuation and moratorium applicability in cases of 
data reclamation. There are also chances that introducing 
mediation in insolvency proceedings could pose challenges, 
including whether mediation acceptance by operational 
creditors indicate a pre-existing dispute, or if this affects 
their ability to file for insolvency. 
NCLT has been a weakness of IBC, hence the Standing 
Committee on Finance has emphasised on the dire need to 
address infrastructure and human capacity gaps in NCLT. 
As this year progresses, resolving these shortcomings will 
be important for IBC’s success and this was reiterated 
in two instances in 2024. In the Jet Airways case, the 
Supreme Court emphasised on prioritising the appointment 
of tribunal members with domain expertise and addressing 
the infrastructure needs. Then, the Standing Committee 
on Finance’s report on ‘Demands for Grants (2024-25)’ 
noted that any delays in insolvency resolutions, particularly 
during admission and adjudication at the NCLT, remains 
as a bottleneck.
It is good to see positive steps being made like the 
appointment of new members in 2025 and addressing NCLT 
deficiencies, enhancing IBC outcomes.
At the start of 2025, we expect to see the appointment 
of new members. If openings are promptly filled and the 
necessary upgrades are made to the infrastructure, IBC 
outcomes are sure to improve. However, it is hard to predict 
if NCLT capacity and infrastructure will improve this soon, 
as the problem has been brewing for some years now. 
Other flaws in the IBC would not be noticeable if these 
shortcomings of NCLT are fixed, and then we can focus on 
additional development. 
As one of Indian economic structure’s strong 
pillar, the IBC keeps evolving consistently, 
expressing a strong dedication to improve 
the bankruptcy procedures and handling 
challenges with ease. In 2025, the flexibility of 
IBC and its focus on balancing the interests 
of all stakeholders will be very crucial for 
effectively navigating the complex legal and 
regulatory environment.”

Signs of recovery are emerging as the global M&A 
landscape comes out of a period of stagnation. A possible 
rebound in M&A activity is suggested by the fact that the 
economic and geopolitical uncertainties that had hampered 
the market in recent years are starting to fade. 
The number of deals exceeding USD 1 billion rose from 
430 in 2023 to over 500 in 2024, boosting average deal 
sizes by 11%. This trend is driven by corporate dealmakers 
utilising highly valued stock and PE funds seeking larger 
transactions. Megadeals, especially in sectors like 
technology, energy and banking expanded significantly, 
with notable activity also emerging in insurance and media. 
Even with making up 1% of the almost 50,000 M&A deals 
announced worldwide in 2024, big deals have a significant 
impact on the overall market sentiments. High-profile 
transactions frequently serve as a catalyst for others in the 
market to aggressively explore M&A strategies in an effort to 
maintain competitiveness and seize expansion prospects. 
The drop of 18% in smaller and mid-sized transactions 
tempered with the overall optimism, giving conflicting 
signals to dealmakers.
•	
M&A as a growth and transformation strategy in sectors 
like technology, energy and banking
•	
High valuations pushing investors to undertake 
strategic deals
•	
Increased reliance on equity financing or more creative 
deal structures due to rise in long-term interest rates 
making financing more expensive
•	
Concentrated activity with potential for megadeals 
in the media, finance, insurance, energy and 
technology sectors 
•	
Growing supply of assets from PE exits and corporate 
divestitures, increasing acquisition opportunities
•	
Expanding pool of assets via corporate divestitures and 
PE exits, creating more acquisition opportunities

Global M&A industry trends: 2025 Outlook
Three key trends intensifying in the market:
Focus on growth and business 
transformation with M&A as the growth 
strategy and divestiture driving transformation
Artificial intelligence (AI) as a catalyst 
for change and reinvention supercharging 
investments and attracting capital
Higher PE exits due to increasing 
pressure to exit mature portfolio 
company investments
The newfound M&A impetus is supported by a number of 
factors, such as a CEO-driven emphasis on development 
and transformation in the face of AI, increased easy 
access to financing, and an expanding pool of assets from 
corporate divestitures and PE portfolios.
Dealmakers, however, need to be on the lookout for a 
few wildcards that could affect M&A activity. After policy 
changes, geopolitical unpredictability poses persistent 
difficulties. Furthermore, even if central banks have lowered 
interest rates and inflation has decreased, long-term 
rates are rising again, making refinancing more difficult 
and reducing possible profits. The situation is further 
complicated by high valuations, especially in the US, which 
may lead investors to look for value in other markets.
Although there are still many unknowns, the alignment of a 
number of elements points to a positive outlook for M&A in 
2025. The M&A landscape may be ready for a big uptick, 
fueling the  promise for a strong recovery with large deal 
activity encouraging the market momentum.
