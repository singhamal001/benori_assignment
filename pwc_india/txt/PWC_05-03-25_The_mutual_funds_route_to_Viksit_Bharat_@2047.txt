Foreword 
India stands on the cusp of a transformative era, with 2047 marking a momentous milestone – the centenary of our 
independence. As we navigate towards this historic moment, we have a unique opportunity to lay the cornerstone of 
a nation defined by financial empowerment, inclusive growth and economic resilience.
The mutual fund industry in India is poised to play a crucial role in this journey. Over the years, the industry has seen 
remarkable progress in AUM and SIP contributions. However, this progress only scratches the surface of the true 
potential. Less than 5% of India’s 1.4 billion population actively participates in mutual funds – a stark contrast with 
mature markets such as the United States, where mutual fund penetration exceeds 50%.1 Bridging this gap presents 
both a challenge and an extraordinary opportunity.
By 2047, we envision an India where mutual funds are a tool for wealth creation as well as a foundation of financial 
security for every household. Achieving this requires prioritising trust-building, technological integration, process 
simplification and, most importantly, financial literacy. Empowering the next generation of investors with the 
knowledge and confidence to participate in capital markets will be crucial to unlocking the industry’s vast potential.
Our roadmap for the future must focus on innovation, accessibility and inclusivity. India’s socioeconomic diversity 
demands tailored approaches to engaging communities where financial decision making typically is localised and 
collective. We must go beyond offering various investment products and ensure that these products remain simple, 
transparent and accessible to investors from all walks of life.
The democratisation of financial wellbeing is within our grasp. However, this requires a concerted effort from all 
stakeholders – asset managers, advisors, distributors, investors, policymakers, service providers and the media. 
Together, we must foster an ecosystem that transcends the barriers of geography, income and financial literacy, 
ensuring that investing becomes a seamless and integral dimension of every Indian’s financial planning journey. All 
Indians should feel empowered to take control of their financial future, from young students to retirees.
I am delighted to introduce this vision document, which presents a comprehensive roadmap for the evolution of 
the mutual fund industry – from expanding financial inclusion to achieving genuine investor empowerment. The 
document underscores the critical need to prioritise investor education, balance innovation and risk management, 
and foster a culture of trust. It challenges us to make investing accessible, intuitive and empowering for all.
While there are valuable lessons to learn from the evolution of the mutual fund industry in mature markets such 
as the United States, India must forge its own path that aligns with its unique social, economic and demographic 
realities. We aim to ensure that the mutual fund industry promotes financial inclusion and catalyses sustainable 
economic growth.
I thank the team at PwC for their insightful contributions to shaping this document. I also wish to acknowledge the 
instrumental role of SEBI in fostering the industry’s growth and ensuring its alignment with the best interests of 
investors. Together, let us commit to building a mutual fund industry that drives India towards a future of financial 
prosperity and inclusion.

Foreword 
The mutual fund industry has seen remarkable growth in terms of both assets under management (AUM) and 
number of unique customers over the last five years. The industry AUM has grown by ~175%, from INR 24.78 trillion 
in April 2019 to INR 68 trillion in January 2025. The number of unique customers increased from 1.93 crore to over 
5.33 crore during the same period. The systematic investment plan (SIP) contribution has grown nearly sixfold, from 
INR 8,055 crore in March 2019 to INR 26,400 crore in January 2025.2
Despite this progress, the industry remains in its early stages of development. As India continues its ascent to 
become the world’s third-largest economy by 2030, mutual fund participation remains restricted to a small fraction 
of the population. This represents a significant challenge as well as an extraordinary opportunity for growth and 
inclusion. 
As we move towards the vision of Viksit Bharat by 2047, our mission is to foster financial wellbeing by building a 
financially empowered India where mutual funds are a cornerstone of every household’s financial future. To achieve 
this, we seek to increase retail mutual fund penetration from ~3.6% in 2025 to approximately 15% by 2047. While 
India’s saving rate is among the highest globally, a substantial portion of these savings remains invested in low-
return instruments, creating unbalanced portfolios. Empowering India’s citizens requires that we redirect more of 
this capital into productive assets such as equities and mutual funds, which have proven their ability to create long-
term wealth. This transformation, however, requires a paradigm shift in mindset – from traditional, passive saving 
habits to active, disciplined and future-focused investing. This shift must be tailored to address the diverse financial 
behaviours and needs of India’s vast and diverse investor base. 
Achieving this vision requires a multipronged, investor-centric approach. We must simplify and broaden access to 
mutual funds, leverage innovation and communicate in ways that resonate with the diverse financial perspectives 
across the country. At the same time, we must cultivate a robust investment culture while harnessing new-age 
technologies to make investing seamless and accessible for millions, both in urban and rural areas. 
This document is a call to action to all stakeholders – policymakers, asset managers, distributors and individuals. 
It emphasises the need for collective efforts to boost investor confidence, simplify the investment process and 
foster a culture of long-term wealth creation. More than a mere roadmap, this vision document represents a shared 
commitment to drive systemic change, paving the way for a society where financial security and autonomy are 
within every citizen’s reach. 
I thank the team at PwC and all the contributors for their dedication and efforts in bringing this document to life. Let 
us embark together on this transformative journey towards a financially inclusive and empowered India.

Six decades into India’s mutual fund journey, the industry stands on the cusp of an extraordinary 
transformation. Its evolution from a single product, single-player model in the 1960s to today’s dynamic 
ecosystem – comprising 40+ asset management companies, over 1,500 schemes, more than 2 lakh active 
distributors and over 22.9 crore investor accounts (as of January 2025) – reflects not just growth but a 
fundamental reimagining of India’s financial landscape.3
Today, India’s mutual fund industry epitomises the intersection of technological sophistication and financial 
democratisation. Our streamlined KYC operations, competitive cost structures and transparent asset 
disclosure practices set global benchmarks. We pioneered digital-first solutions while retaining the flexibility 
to serve investors across the socioeconomic spectrum through small-ticket investment options. These 
accomplishments, however, signify not an endpoint but a foundation for an even more ambitious future.
As we chart our course towards Viksit Bharat 2047, we recognise a fundamental truth: The success of 
the industry is inextricably linked to the holistic financial empowerment of every Indian citizen. Financial 
wellbeing represents far more than wealth accumulation or sophisticated investment portfolios; it is a 
transformative condition where individuals possess the means and the confidence to navigate their financial 
present and future. It manifests in the ability to meet daily obligations without strain, build resilience against 
life’s uncertainties, pursue aspirations without compromise and craft legacies for future generations. 
Financial sovereignty – where money enables rather than constrains – is essential to realising the vision of a 
developed India.
This Amrit Kaal marks a defining moment for India’s mutual fund industry. It envisions a dramatic expansion 
on the basis of our estimates, with over 26 crore investors served by around 2047 and AUM scaling to 
approximately USD 33 trillion. More significantly, this growth will catapult India’s mutual fund assets from a 
current GDP ratio of 19% to over 110%, positioning India alongside global investment powerhouses. These 
numbers, while impressive, underscore a deeper imperative. As India advances towards becoming a USD 
30 trillion economy, the mutual fund industry must continue evolving from being a beneficiary of growth to 
becoming its catalyst.
The past decade’s achievements underscore this potential. Monthly SIP inflows have surged from INR 
3,000 crore to INR 19,000 crore, further crossing the INR 26,000 crore mark in January 2025. Further, 
B30 cities have demonstrated unprecedented momentum, with their AUM contributions rising from 9% 
to approximately 19% – a remarkable growth rate of ~9.5x in absolute terms. Digital transformation has 
revolutionised access, with 60% of transactions forming ~21% of the transaction value now occurring 
digitally, compared to 45% of transactions forming 1% of the transaction value in FY2013.4
However, unlocking our industry’s full potential requires a fundamental shift in approach. By drawing on 
insights from transformative successes across sectors – from telecommunications to healthcare – we 
realise that sustainable change requires more than product innovation. It entails deep cultural resonance, 
community engagement and solutions that complement rather than replace existing financial wisdom.
To engineer this transformation, we propose a comprehensive framework built on four interconnected 
pillars:
Strategic orchestration
•	
Enhanced coordination among industry stakeholders through the Association of Mutual Funds in 
India’s (AMFI) governance mechanism
•	
Development of regional strategies that respect cultural nuances while driving financial inclusion
•	
Creation of robust research mechanisms to understand and address behavioural patterns
Infrastructure evolution
•	
Transformation of registrars and transfer agents (RTAs) into intelligent platforms for handling 
unprecedented scale
•	
Implementation of vernacular solutions and intuitive investor journeys
•	
Development of cloud-enabled capabilities ensuring real-time, secure operations
Regulatory partnership
•	
Collaborative frameworks balancing innovation with the necessary guardrails
•	
Development of new product categories that meet emerging demographic needs enhanced disclosure 
mechanisms that promote transparency while enabling growth

Cultural integration
•	
Region-specific communication strategies that leverage local leadership networks
•	
Products that align with community financial practices and aspirations
•	
Technology integration with traditional distribution networks
This vision demands transforming the investor journey by adopting an investor-centric approach with 
focused attention on the following:
1.	 Simplified accessibility for all 
•	
Intuitive multilingual platforms with vernacular support
•	
AI-powered personalised and assisted investment journeys
•	
Voice-assisted navigation and bite-sized education
•	
Collaborative features enabling guided decision making
2.	 Relevant product innovation and communication
•	
Lifecycle solutions reflecting Indian family structures
•	
Technology-enabled investment products
•	
Strategic offerings bridging current market gaps
•	
Cultural alignment in communication strategies
3.	 Inclusive solutions
•	
Accessible platforms for specially abled individuals
•	
Flexible investment options for gig economy and blue-collar workers
•	
Visual and audio-based systems for limited literacy
•	
Community-based comprehensive investor education programmes
4.	 Behavioural transformation 
•	
Deep understanding of regional investment psychology
•	
Trust-building through community engagement
•	
Early-stage financial literacy integration 
5.	 Ensuring last-mile connectivity
•	
Hyperlocal guidance through trusted community networks
•	
Integration with the existing retail infrastructure
•	
Ongoing leveraging of technology to bridge the accessibility gap
The moment before us is unprecedented. Just as the liberalisation of the 1990s laid the groundwork for 
today’s achievements, our decisions today will shape India’s financial landscape for generations. The 
mutual fund industry is uniquely positioned to drive this transformation – not merely as an investment 
vehicle, but as a catalyst for national development.
As we progress towards Viksit Bharat @2047, success will be measured in assets managed or accounts 
opened as well as lives transformed. The path ahead demands unprecedented collaboration, unwavering 
commitment to innovation and a deep understanding of Indian investors’ needs and aspirations, where 
mutual funds serve as the cornerstone of India’s financial wellbeing.
The industry’s opportunity and responsibility are evident. Through collective action and a shared vision, the 
industry ecosystem can ensure that financial wellbeing is not just an aspiration but also a reality for every 
Indian citizen.

The journey so far
10 | PwC | The mutual funds route to Viksit Bharat @2047
A. Phase 1: Laying the foundation (1964–2014)
The evolution of India’s mutual fund industry reflects a long journey of expanding investment choices, deeply 
intertwined with the nation’s economic transformation. In 1964, India’s economy was predominantly agrarian, with 
agriculture contributing 45%–50% of GDP and employing nearly 70% of the workforce.5 Bank deposits dominated 
the rudimentary financial sector for retail investors.
The critical challenge was economic. Persistent inflation of 6%–8% annually6 eroded the value of savings, with 
bank fixed deposits averaging only 4%–6%.7 This wealth erosion created an urgent need for alternative investment 
options. The first mutual fund product, introduced in 1963 with support from the government and regulators, 
emerged as an innovative solution to mobilise household savings and facilitate wealth creation through capital 
markets.
Phase 1A: The paradox of choice (1964–1987)
The mutual fund industry initially faced the paradox of limited choice. Beginning with a single product, US-64 
was constrained by conservative investor expectations and a narrow urban demographic. However, economic 
reforms in the 1990s gradually transformed the landscape. Private sector innovation introduced specialised 
schemes and systematic investment plans (SIPs), democratising market access.
By the mid-2010s, mutual funds had evolved from a singular, government-backed option into a vibrant ecosystem 
characterised by flexibility, transparency and investor empowerment. This evolution highlights the critical role 
of choice – not just as a market strategy, but as a fundamental mechanism for fostering a more inclusive and 
dynamic investment landscape.
The journey from a single, balanced approach to a diverse array of investment products illustrates a broader 
narrative of financial maturation. What started as a limited, government-guided investment option has evolved into 
a sophisticated market that enables investors to align their investments with personal financial goals and risk 
tolerances.
Phase 1B: Expanded choice of players and products (1987–1995)
Macroeconomic and market conditions: The need for diversified choices and regulatory oversight
The early 1990s marked a transformative period for India’s financial landscape, with profound economic challenges 
demanding innovative investment solutions. By 1990, India’s fiscal deficit had surged to approximately 8.3% of 
GDP8 – significantly higher than global counterparts like the United States and the United Kingdom – creating an 
urgent need for capital generation from within the economy.

The severe economic strain, compounded by inflation reaching 13.1% in 19919 and a critical balance of payments 
crisis, compelled India to implement comprehensive economic reforms. These challenges positioned the mutual fund 
industry as a vital mechanism for mobilising retail savings and channelling household investments into the formal 
financial sector.
The government responded strategically by encouraging public sector entities to enter the mutual fund market. 
Reaching beyond urban elites, access was provided to semiurban and rural investors, leveraging its extensive 8,000+ 
branch network.10 
Alongside market expansion, the regulatory framework evolved significantly, starting with the current regulator 
receiving its statutory powers in 1992 – a critical development to enforce transparency, protect investor interests 
and establish fair trading practices. Establishing the Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI) in 1995 further 
solidified the industry’s commitment to self-regulation and ethical standards.
The results were remarkable. AUM surged from INR 6,700 crore in 198711 to INR 47,000 crore by 199512 while the 
investor base expanded from 1.5 million to 6 million accounts. Approximately 50 new schemes were introduced, 
encompassing debt, balanced and cautiously structured equity-linked investments.
Nevertheless, significant challenges remained. By 1995, only 25–30% of urban households possessed basic 
mutual fund literacy, limiting deeper market penetration. Long-term industry growth would fundamentally depend on 
comprehensive investor education and demystifying these financial instruments.
This period represented far more than market expansion  – it was a time of fundamentally reimagining India’s 
investment ecosystem, laying the groundwork for a more sophisticated, inclusive and democratised financial 
sector.
Phase 1C: Expanding product choices: Diverse schemes, increased demand and the 
advent of private sector innovation (1995–2014)
The entry of private sector asset management companies (AMCs) around the year 2000 revolutionised the industry. 
By 2005, private AMCs held 35% of AUM,13 introducing specialised schemes like sector-sp ecific funds, equity-
linked savings schemes (ELSS) and fixed maturity plans (FMPs). Introduced in the late 1990s, SIPs encouraged 
disciplined investments, while exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and fund of funds (FoFs) offered retail investors 
low-cost, diversified options. By 2013, these innovations made mutual funds more accessible to cost-conscious 
investors.
Regulatory advancements strengthened investor protection and transparency. Key measures included standardised 
disclosure norms, expense ratio caps and the abolition of entry loads in 2008, which reduced costs for retail 
investors. Investor education initiatives, such as the Market Awareness Campaign (2003), boosted financial literacy, 
with awareness in urban areas rising from 20% in 2005 to 50% by 2014.14 The simplified know your customer (KYC) 
procedures introduced in 2011 further streamlined onboarding, increasing the value of mutual fund accounts to 3.5 
crore by 2014.15 
These developments drove exceptional growth in investor participation and industry AUM, which surged from INR 
47,000 crore in 199516 to INR 10 lakh crore by 2014.17 Retail investors – contributing 50% of total AUM by 201418– 
embraced mutual funds as a mainstream choice, aided by SIPs and an expanding distribution network of 75,00019 
including RIAs and IFAs.

B. Phase-2: Gaining momentum and democratisation (2015–2024)
By 2014, mutual fund industry AUM had surged from ~INR 47,000 crore to ~INR 10 lakh crore.20 In contrast, SIP 
AUM accounted for a small fraction, i.e. INR 1,000 crore in monthly inflows,21 owing to the limited adoption by the 
more prominent retail investor class stemming from low financial awareness, product understanding and investor 
psyche. The years 2015–2024 have been a defining period for the Indian mutual fund industry, characterised by 
significant democratisation of investment avenues, unparalleled growth, and a significant broadening of investor 
participation. As the industry evolves, it plays an essential role in supporting the vision of Viksit Bharat 2047 – a 
developed India characterised by inclusive and sustainable growth.
After 2014, India’s mutual fund AUM grew exponentially, more than doubling of the global mutual fund AUM 
market share from 0.3% to 0.8% by 2023,22 expanding from INR 10.8 lakh crore in 201523 to over INR 68 lakh 
crore by November 2024 (INR 53.40 lakh crore by March 2024) 24– a nearly sixfold increase. This exponential 
growth was fuelled primarily by retail participation, buoyant equity markets and structural shifts in the country’s 
mutual fund and capital market ecosystems, largely mainly by structural changes in the domestic mutual fund and 
capital markets ecosystem. 
Product innovation, regulatory reforms, technological advancements and a strong focus on investor education, 
key drivers of this transformation, have all been instrumental in overcoming the industry’s existing challenges and 
positioning it on an unprecedented growth trajectory.

Conclusion
The evolution of choice in India’s mutual fund industry is a testament to how increasing competition, 
innovation and regulation have shaped a strong, investor-focused market. The rise in investor literacy, 
bolstered by a dynamic regulatory framework and innovative product offerings, has democratised access 
to financial markets, providing new investors the tools and knowledge to engage in wealth creation and 
economic growth. This journey of choice – from a single product market to a diversified ecosystem – 
underscores the mutual fund industry’s resilience and adaptability in meeting the constantly evolving needs 
of India’s growing investor base.

The following sections will dive into the critical challenges  that existed and the strategic responses being adopted by 
the industry ecosystem. 
A. Existing challenges tackled in this decade 
Retail investors seeking to build wealth through mutual funds have faced systemic challenges over the past decade. 
We have identified the key issues impacting the industry according to investment personas. The three investor 
personas were as follows: 
1.	 Casual investors (investors who are aware but are hesitant to invest considering market risks and affordability of 
investments)
2.	 Informed investors (investors who are willing to invest but lack a confidant)
3.	 Uninformed investors (those who lack financial education) 
Figure 3: Key challenges that hindered mutual fund adoption in India
1.	 The casual investors’ conundrum: Balancing market uncertainty and affordability with the lure of stable 
alternatives 
Mutual funds primarily deterred casual retail investors due to the limited trust stemming from several 
market corrections and the inherent volatility of equity markets, leading to uncertain market returns. 
Net returns on mutual funds were further impacted by elevated total expense ratios (TERs) stemming from 
exit loads, management fees and commissions. Thus, volatile capital markets and high investment costs 
tempered casual investor sentiments during this period. 
The availability of more dependable options, like the public provident fund (PPF), also reduced the lure 
of mutual funds. The PPF stood out for its sovereign guarantee with returns higher than fixed deposits, 
offering a secure foundation that was highly attractive to risk-averse investors. Thus, the PPF’s positioning as a 
compelling choice often drew investors away from the more dynamic landscape of mutual funds.
2.	 Distribution deficits: The accessibility gap for India’s ‘informed’ investors
Despite increasing awareness, India’s mutual fund industry around 2013–2014 grappled with severe 
distribution constraints compared to the expansive reach enjoyed by the insurance sector. While insurance 
relied on an extensive pan-India network of over two million agents,25 mutual funds had only approximately 
80,000–100,000 AMFI-registered distributors,26 concentrated mainly in metropolitan areas. This disparity of 
reach left retail investors who were aware yet cautious, particularly those with smaller investable surpluses, 
without accessible advisory support to understand the benefits of investing in mutual funds. These investors 
lacked the confidence to independently invest in equity-linked instruments owing to market volatility and 
inaccessibility of advice.

3.	 Persistent lack of investor awareness
One of the most significant challenges to fully democratising mutual funds has been the lack of investor 
awareness, particularly outside urban centres. 
Low financial literacy in Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities and a preference for traditional, more straightforward and 
perceived-safer options, such as fixed deposits, PPFs, and gold, hindered broader adoption. Complexities 
around fund categories, risk-return dynamics and new product types further confused uninformed investors, 
resulting in lower conversion rates and product uptake.
These challenges underscore the complex relationships between structural barriers and behavioural factors. 
Addressing these issues required the concerted efforts of the regulator, asset management companies, 
distributors and FinTech platforms. At the same time, the industry leveraged product innovations, education 
campaigns and digital platforms to reduce the gap between potential and actual investor participation.
In the next section, we explore how various interventions – product, technological, regulatory and association-
driven – helped mitigate these challenges and propel mutual fund growth in India.
B. Strategic interventions to sustain the scaling momentum
The mutual fund industry’s rapid growth in India from 2015 to 2024 is attributed to targeted products, technology-
driven, along with association and regulatory, interventions that addressed challenges with respect to returns 
stability, cost efficiency, accessibility and awareness, broadening and diversifying the investor base.

1.	 Empowering casual investors: The focused push to navigate market volatility and high costs
•	
Emergence of SIPs to address market volatility and instil investment discipline
The significant uptake of SIPs as a structured investment approach has been a hallmark of this period. 
This uptake was propelled by several factors, including the emergence of digital platforms, the ease of 
KYC and seamless onboarding, focused campaigns and awareness efforts and positioning SIPs as 
an accessible low-ticket-size tool to generate wealth and achieve one’s financial goals. By reinforcing the 
principle of cost averaging, SIPs offered casual investors a disciplined, risk-averse method to accumulate 
mutual fund units across volatile market cycles. AMCs further capitalised on this approach through tactical 
initiatives like value SIPs, power SIPs, top-up SIPs and prepaid SIPs. They also leveraged massive 
awareness campaigns along with the rise of digital platforms.
•	
Direct plans and passive funds: 
At the same time, direct plans and passive funds rose to prominence, catering to investors seeking cost-
efficient and diversified portfolio exposure. Direct funds eliminated intermediary costs, while passive 
funds provided investors with a low-cost, index-based entry into capital markets
Additionally, given that the alpha generation is known to be elusive in the long run, the lower cost of entry 
and exit associated with passive investment options has made them increasingly attractive investment

options. The expansion of direct plans’ AUM share from 31% to 46% and passive plans from a mere 
1.58% to a 17.5% market share in this period underscored the acceptance of these instruments.27 
•	
Rise of registered investment advisors (RIAs):
Introduced in 2013, the RIA framework institutionalised fiduciary standards, gradually leading to circa 1000 
RIAs,28 underscoring the demand for personalised financial planning services. RIAs prioritise client goals 
over product sales, fostering trust and long-term engagement and providing guidance with the investor’s 
best interest in mind. Thus, RIAs empower and enable casual investors to make more informed financial 
decisions, fostering greater financial resilience.
2.	 Technological interventions: Enabling seamless accessibility and scalability
Technology has become a transformative force in the mutual fund industry, facilitating seamless access, 
improving operational efficiency and improving the investor experience. These advancements have 
leveraged digital platforms, process automation and tech-driven distribution models, making mutual funds 
more accessible to an increasingly aware investor base, particularly in Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities where financial 
knowledge is growing but traditional investment channels remain limited.
•	
Digital-first platforms: Empowering investors 
The advent of digital-first platforms has redefined how investors access mutual funds. These platforms 
draw in tech-savvy individuals while extending their reach to previously underserved segments in Tier-2 
and Tier-3 cities. These platforms simplify investment journeys with features such as goal-based investing, 
real-time portfolio tracking and personalised recommendations, empowering investors to make 
informed and independent decisions.
These platforms have technologies such as e-KYC, Aadhaar-enabled onboarding and unified payments 
interface (UPI)-based payments, eliminating traditional barriers through digital distribution and making 
investments seamless and accessible. The streamlined execution and intuitive user interfaces have 
created a more inclusive and investor-friendly ecosystem.
•	
The role of RTAs: Enabling scalability with precision
RTAs are the operational backbone of the mutual fund industry. RTAs leverage automation, enabling 
AMCs to scale operations efficiently while ensuring error-free processing and reliable services. This has 
significantly reduced operational costs and enhanced efficiency for AMCs, allowing them to cater to the 
market’s growing demands. 
RTAs also provide centralised digital platforms, offering investors real-time access to portfolios, 
transaction histories and account details, enhancing transparency and convenience. Additionally, RTAs 
empower FinTech platforms through API integration, seamlessly delivering mutual fund services to a 
younger, tech-savvy demographic. Riding the wave of financial inclusion, ushered in by the Jan Dhan, 
Adhaar, Mobile (JAM) trinity coupled with robust compliance frameworks and data integrity protocols, 
RTAs have also ensured faster, paperless and more secure investor onboarding while adhering to regulatory 
standards, enhancing investor ease, confidence and trust across the ecosystem.
3.	 Association interventions: Advancing investor awareness, financial literacy and investor confidence 
Driven by AMFI in collaboration with AMCs, investor education and awareness have been central to the success 
of mutual fund democratisation. The industry’s growth required ensuring that retail investors understood 
the benefits and risks of mutual funds while addressing misconceptions. In FY24, AMCs conducted 14,505 
programmes for 10,96,192 participants nationwide, while AMFI ran an additional 290 Investor Awareness 
Programmes (IAPs) for 56,528 participants.29 
•	
‘Mutual Funds Sahi Hai’ campaign (2017): 
This groundbreaking campaign transformed public perceptions by simplifying mutual fund investing and 
promoting disciplined SIP-based investments. By 2024, it reached over 350 million Indians, resulting 
in a 30% increase in inflows within five years and significantly boosting retail participation, especially 
in equity funds. The campaign’s success spurred the launch of a follow-up, ‘Mutual Funds Mein Fixed-
Income Wali Baat’, which educates investors on debt funds as a safer, reliable hedge against volatility than 
traditional assets such as FDs.

‘MFD Shuru Karein’ campaign (2022): 
This campaign intended to expand the network of mutual fund distributors (MFDs) by targeting graduates,

retirees and small business owners, showcasing the earning potential of a career in distribution. TV, print 
and digital ads significantly increased the distributor count, from 1.4 lakh in FY21 to over 2 lakh in FY24. 
This initiative has strengthened the distribution system by bridging the gap between investor demand and 
distributor availability, fostering investor education and ensuring the industry’s inclusive growth.

Bharat Nivesh Yatra (2024): 
AMFI’s latest effort to enhance awareness, this initiative deploys four branded buses travelling to 170 cities 
over 75 days, covering financial topics such as goal setting, SIPs and the investment process. Targeting 
underserved and rural areas, this programme exemplifies AMFI’s commitment to expanding investor 
education nationwide.

Conclusion
In summary, the 5x increase in the mutual fund industry measured by AUM over the last decade or so 
is attributed to the concerted efforts of all stakeholders of the ecosystem. AMCs developed innovative 
products and made them attractive for average investors (SIPs, FoFs, ETFs, etc.); technological 
interventions such as digital-first platforms by new-age players and digital tools and infrastructure were 
established by RTAs to streamline onboarding, settlement, record-keeping and servicing; campaigns were 
created to drive customer awareness and distribution reach by AMFI (MF Sahi Hai, MFD Shuru Karein); 
and regulatory interventions were imposed around product simplicity, affordability, democratisation and 
sustainability (36 categories, hybrid asset class, TER capping, ESG disclosures, etc.)
These interventions created a conducive environment not only for existing stakeholders but also ushered 
in new entrants, reshaping the ecosystem’s supply side. The deployment of quantitative models by niche-
focused FinTechs and AMCs catered to an evolving set of expectations from new-age and first-time 
investors. At the same time, traditional AMCs also charted impressive growth, supported by expanding 
margins on the back of economies of scale.

Phase 3: Financial freedom: From financial inclusion to financial wellbeing (2025–47)
Over the past few decades, financial inclusion has profoundly altered India’s economic landscape, bringing millions 
of individuals from the margins into the formal financial ecosystem. Initiatives such as Jan Dhan Yojana (over 80% 
penetration),30 the proliferation of microcredit through SHGs (over 16 crore families)31 and the expansion of digital 
payments (70% UPI transactions)32 have provided households with the tools of financial empowerment. Although 
the door to inclusion has been opened wide, a more fundamental question arises: Are Indians indeed flourishing 
financially?
For many, inclusion has signified little more than an entry point – a foothold in a system that remains daunting, 
fragmented and complex. The journey from inclusion to empowerment is incomplete, often leaving individuals 
vulnerable to financial instability. As the industry charts the course to Viksit Bharat 2047, the challenge lies in 
broadening access and fostering financial wellbeing – i.e. a state of security, resilience and freedom that transforms 
financial systems from enablers into engines of growth.

becoming instead a foundation of opportunity. It is about providing the confidence needed to navigate present 
needs, withstand future uncertainties and pursue long-term ambitions without compromise.

20 | PwC | The mutual funds route to Viksit Bharat @2047
At its core, financial wellbeing is the transition from financial anxiety to financial independence, underpinned by four 
broad pillars of the architecture of a secure and fulfilling financial life:
1. Mastery over day-to-day and month-to-month finances
Imagine being able to meet every monthly obligation – groceries, school fees or utility bills – without the fear of 
running out of money before the next paycheck. This control is transformative for countless households, marking 
the difference between restless nights and lasting peace of mind. It is the foundation of stability, achieved through 
disciplined financial management where spending and earnings align, and the threat of perpetual debt is banished. 
About 57% of Indians are increasingly worried about inflation, while 34% struggle to manage routine 
expenses. This concern is underscored by the country’s declining household savings rate, which fell from 23.6% of 
GDP in FY12 to just around 18% in FY23.
Adding to this challenge is the growing imbalance between income and expenditure. Over the past decade, while 
per capita net national income (NNI) grew at a 9% CAGR,33 private final consumption expenditure (PFCE) expanded 
at a faster 10% CAGR,34 reflecting the persistent pressure of rising consumption. For many households, pursuing 
aspirations is at the expense of financial stability, eroding their ability to save or invest for the future.
2. Resilience against financial shocks
The unpredictability of life is a universal truth. A sudden medical emergency, an unforeseen job loss or an 
unexpected home repair can ruin even the most diligent of financial planning. Financial wellbeing demands more 
than survival; it calls for resilience. This requires creating a financial buffer – a contingency fund that absorbs the 
brunt of life’s shocks. More than a safety net, this buffer is an anchor of emotional strength, empowering individuals 
to face adversity with courage and confidence.
The lack of preparedness among Indian households is particularly stark, with a significant proportion of the 
population paying for healthcare out-of-pocket, accounting for 50% of India’s total health expenditure in 2021, 
compared to the global average of 17%.35 
While health costs are a visible trigger, they are part of a broader pattern of financial instability. The lack of robust 
emergency funds exposes households to various shocks, from agricultural losses in rural India to job insecurity 
in urban centres. Despite incremental progress in insurance penetration and saving awareness, 40 crore Indians 
remain uninsured,36 risking financial ruin when emergencies strike. 
3. Autonomy to make choices
True financial freedom is rooted in choice – the ability to direct resources towards necessity and aspiration. It is the 
liberty to say ‘yes’ to a family vacation, invest in a child’s education or seize an unexpected opportunity without 
financial constraints. This freedom embodies dignity, autonomy and the capacity to live on one’s own terms, where 
decisions are guided by aspiration rather than limitation.
For many Indian households, spending on necessities dominates their financial landscape. With 75% of retail 
spending allocated to groceries and other essentials, discretionary spending amounts to only 25%, curtailing 
opportunities for quality-of-life upgrades.37 
By comparison, the US and China allocate 60–70% of household spending to discretionary categories,38 
reflecting the transformative power of financial flexibility. In India, this divide is most visible across income groups: 
While lower-income households spend almost entirely on essentials, affluent consumers drive the demand for 
premium products and lifestyle improvements. For a large segment of the population, freedom of choice is an 
unfulfilled aspiration, tethered to the constraints of necessity.
4. A roadmap to reach financial goals
Financial wellbeing is as much about the future as about the present. From owning a home to planning for 
retirement, everyone envisions milestones that shape their financial aspirations. However, these dreams are rarely 
achieved by chance. Reaching financial goals requires a journey of deliberate action, disciplined planning and an 
unwavering commitment to purpose. It is the satisfaction of watching ambitions transform into reality, one thoughtful 
step at a time.

According to surveys, the future for many Indians is fraught with uncertainty, with 88% of respondents anticipating 
financial instability over the next five years39 and 80% lacking clarity on retirement planning.40 This ambiguity 
extends even to affluent households, where 40% lack sufficient emergency funds41 and 27% face gaps in tax 
planning.42 
A call to action 
The above-mentioned data clarifies that achieving financial wellbeing is not a luxury – it is a fundamental need. 
Rising costs, fragile safety nets, constrained choices and unplanned futures underscore the urgency of equipping 
households with tools and strategies to navigate an increasingly complex financial world. 
The new frontier
As India marches through the ‘Amrit Kaal’, the vision of financial wellbeing is both a national imperative and personal 
transformation for millions. It shifts the narrative from participating in financial systems to thriving in them. 
In other words, ‘Financial inclusion was the beginning; financial wellbeing is the destination’. However, this 
destination demands a closer examination of the challenges that hinder financial wellbeing for households across the 
socio-economic strata. From rising living costs to unplanned futures, the need for a comprehensive framework that 
addresses these gaps has never been more pressing.
Financial wellbeing is not one-size-fits-all
While these challenges affect individuals across socioeconomic strata, the meaning of financial wellbeing varies 
widely depending on particular contexts. For an affluent urban professional, this might mean diversifying investments 
and planning for retirement. For a farmer in rural India, it could be about ensuring stability through emergency funds 
and affordable credit. These disparities highlight that financial wellbeing is deeply personal, shaped by affluence, 
lifestyle, geography, preferences and aspirations.
India’s socioeconomic diversity contrasts sharply with the homogeneity of most developed economies, where 
financial systems cater to relatively uniform needs. Thus, directly replicating the strategies of developed markets in 
India will likely fail to address the country’s layered complexities.
For financial wellbeing to be meaningful in this context, India requires its own approach that recognises these 
nuances and tailors solutions to its unique demographic and cultural fabric.
Section 2: Mutual funds – the ‘fit for purpose’ instrument
India’s financial landscape is marked by a growing urgency to transition from inclusion to wellbeing – a shift that 
recognises its society’s diverse financial realities. As aspirations grow and vulnerabilities multiply, the need for a 
scalable, adaptable and empowering financial tool has never been greater.
Similar to the transformative success of UPI – which democratised digital transactions by combining accessibility, 
versatility and trust – mutual funds are potentially a cornerstone of financial wellbeing in India. UPI’s evolution from 
a niche innovation to a ubiquitous enabler of payments provides a blueprint for mutual funds – simplify, personalise 
and deliver value at scale.
The core attributes of mutual funds – access, usage and quality – establish a foundation for bridging the gap 
between financial inclusion and financial empowerment. These attributes position mutual funds as a transformative 
instrument for reshaping the wealth-building opportunities for a broad and diverse investor base.
Access: Bringing wealth creation within reach
Mutual funds have redefined how Indians engage with financial markets by offering unparalleled accessibility.  
End-to-end digital platforms (EOPs) and do-it-yourself (DIY) models have transformed investing into a seamless 
process, enabling individuals to make decisions from the convenience of their smartphones. Online platforms 
facilitating seamless investments, AMC websites, mobile apps and bank channels ensure that mutual funds are 
accessible across many touchpoints.

In the subsequent sections, we explore how mutual funds can play a transformative role in addressing these 
gaps and elevating financial wellbeing across the nation, while navigating the challenges of India’s layered 
diversity.
22 | PwC | The mutual funds route to Viksit Bharat @2047
This accessibility extends beyond technology. Mutual funds are distributed through diverse channels, including 
distributors, RIAs and exchanges, making them available to millions. This multichannel approach ensures that 
mutual funds are not merely a tool for the affluent but that they also hold the promise of reaching the farthest corners 
of India’s socioeconomic spectrum.
The success of mutual funds in democratising access reflects the same principles that drove the wide adoption 
of UPIs. Both instruments have proven their ability to integrate seamlessly into the lives of individuals across 
geographies and socioeconomic contexts, bringing sophisticated systems to the masses.
Usage: A pathway to building wealth 
The promise of mutual funds lies in their ability to deliver inflation-beating returns while catering to a broad 
spectrum of financial goals. Over the past decade, benchmarks like the Nifty 50 have consistently delivered 11–12% 
CAGR (2013–23),43 significantly outpacing Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation, which has averaged 5–6%.44 For 
investors, this means that mutual funds both preserve and increase wealth, making them a vital tool for achieving 
long-term financial security.
Mutual fund affordability further strengthens this proposition. With SIPs starting as low as INR 100 and INR 
500, mutual funds allow first-time investors to participate in financial markets without the burden of large initial 
commitments. For cost-conscious participants, direct plans eliminate intermediary fees, offering a streamlined, low-
cost option for wealth accumulation.
Moreover, mutual fund versatility ensures that they align with diverse financial goals. With 1,500+ schemes across 
36 categories,45 investors can develop portfolios tailored to their risk tolerance, time horizons and specific 
objectives – whether it’s saving for education, purchasing a home or building a retirement corpus.
This ability to cater to varied needs is akin to UPI’s adaptability, allowing both microtransactions for individuals and 
large-scale transactions for businesses. 
Quality: Trust built through resilience and transparency
Mutual funds have shown remarkable resilience across economic cycles, offering stability and reliability even in 
turbulent times. Despite challenges such as the 2008 financial crisis, demonetisation, debt defaults by large 
financial institutions and the COVID-19 pandemic, the underlying markets have consistently reclaimed their 
previous highs, confirming mutual funds’ reputation as a long-term wealth-building instrument.
Transparency is another cornerstone of the appeal of mutual funds. Governed by stringent regulations, they ensure 
robust investor protection through mandatory disclosures, risk assessments and operational oversight. Unlike 
unregulated or poorly monitored instruments, mutual funds are a beacon of trust, minimising fraud risks and fostering 
confidence.
This focus on resilience and transparency mirrors the success of UPI, which gained trust through its secure, 
government-backed infrastructure and user-centric security measures. 
The road ahead: Expanding the reach of mutual funds
Despite this excellent value proposition as a financial instrument, mutual funds’ current reach is limited to 5.33 crore 
investors (as of January 2025)46 vs. over 25 crore online shoppers,47 2.8 crore of foreign travellers,48 leaving a 
vast majority of India’s population untapped. Transcending a product-centric approach and adopting an investor-
centric journey aligns with the diverse financial aspirations and barriers unique to India’s socioeconomic fabric. Such 
a paradigm shift may help tap into this potential.
A product-centric approach has traditionally shaped the mutual fund industry, focusing on developing various 
schemes and investment strategies. Communication under this model tends to comprise multiple technical terms. 
While this approach has driven growth, improving personalisation would better address individual investors’ unique 
challenges and preferences.
In contrast, an investor-centric approach reimagines the role of mutual funds by placing individuals at the core of 
every decision and interaction. This approach involves understanding India’s regional, social and vernacular diversity 
and aligning offerings and communication with investors’ emotional and practical needs. From the initial stages of

These examples illustrate the transformative potential of providing solutions during the entire investor journey, 
not merely at the investment point, through sustained education, communication and post-investment support. 
Understanding the regional, cultural and economic nuances that shape investor behaviour will be paramount to 
achieving this level of personalisation.
Thus, as mutual funds prepare to expand their reach, it becomes imperative to delve deeper into India’s unique 
financial personas. The following section explores the intricate fabric of India’s diverse financial mindsets and how 
mutual funds can adapt to meet the aspirations of a rapidly evolving investor base.
Section 3
3.1 One nation, multiple financial mindsets: The intricate tapestry of Indian economic 
behaviour beyond economic stereotypes 
Figure 9: Diamond merchant in Surat, tribal 
entrepreneur in Bastar, business owner in 
Meghalaya
India is not just a country, it is a civilization that 
embodies a nation and this is highly evident through our 
economic behaviours. Traditional economic frameworks 
do not stand a chance when confronted with India’s 
complex landscape, where financial decisions are 
shaped by income brackets as well as intricate layers of 
cultural memory, community wisdom and generational 
narratives.
India’s economic diversity defies simple categorisation 
as its unique financial ecosystems showcase diverse 
approaches to wealth creation. For instance, Surat’s 
diamond merchants, particularly the Palanpuri Jain 
community, combine conservative saving with 
aggressive global investments through tight-knit 
community networks and generational knowledge. In 
Kadapa, the Reddy community shifts from traditional 
farming to entrepreneurial ventures, focusing on land, 
education and diversification. In Bastar, tribal groups 
prioritise sustainability and community-driven decision 
making through resource-sharing mechanisms, while 
Meghalaya’s Khasi community operates within a 
matrilineal structure, where women primarily control 
wealth and financial decisions.
Thus the India’s economic fabric thrives not through standardisation, but through a personalised, context-aware 
approach.
Similarly, Neha, a young professional in Bengaluru, might have access to advanced digital platforms but 
struggles to align her investments with her career aspirations. A personalised digital interface could offer Neha 
curated options based on her income, goals and risk tolerance, with AI-powered insights nudging her towards 
smarter decisions.

These elements are not merely theoretical but practical necessities for the industry to truly empower India’s 
diverse populations. To propel the mutual fund industry towards greater inclusivity and financial wellbeing, five key 
imperatives are emphasised as follows.
A. Simplicity - Reimagining financial accessibility beyond complexity
Mutual funds are not rocket science; however, they can seem to be considerably complex to the average investor. 
Although the industry has put in considerable effort to remove the information asymmetry, there is room for further 
simplification. 
Consider the linguistic landscape: Beyond English and Hindi, approximately 400 million Indians communicate 
primarily in regional languages.49 These are not insignificant numbers – they represent entire economic ecosystems 
systematically excluded from sophisticated conversations about finances. While the technical terms are complex 
conceptually, it is always possible to further simplify and clarify these concepts without losing their essence.
Digital platforms, while revolutionary, have inadvertently become labyrinths of complexity. A young professional in 
Bhubaneswar faces the same cognitive overload as someone in Bengaluru – i.e. too many choices that lack clarity. 
The leading interfaces reflect an engineering mindset to developing human-centred design.
But this is where opportunity meets innovation – instead of simplifying interfaces, the goal is to strategically redesign 
financial communication.

journeys, voice-over navigation, 
nudges and warnings, suggestive-
bite-sized educational guides
One-click assistance, collaborative
features, feedback loops
User-centric designs
Personalised and guided  
experience
Collaborative support
1.	 User-centric platform design
•	
Intuitive interface design: Interfaces should continue to evolve in line with user-centric design principles, 
providing a seamless and engaging experience. This entails minimising clutter, using visual hierarchies to 
guide users and incorporating intuitive navigation to make the investment process straightforward and less 
intimidating.
•	
Vernacular support: Platforms can reach a wider audience that may not be proficient in English or Hindi 
through vernacular language options. This inclusion respects the linguistic diversity of India and ensures that 
language barriers do not confine financial literacy.
•	
Simplified language: The financial world would be demystified and investment products would be even 
more approachable by using clear, simplified language. 
•	
Offline integration: For regions with limited internet connectivity, integrating offline options or hybrid 
models that combine digital and physical interactions can expand reach. This could include downloadable 
content, SMS-based updates or partnerships with local community centres to provide in-person support.
2.	 Personalised and guided experiences
•	
Need/goal-based personalised journeys: Platforms should continue to enhance and build on their 
existing personalisation strategies, guiding users on journeys aligned with their financial goals and 
minimising the complexity of an excess of options. By leveraging data analytics and AI, tailored pathways 
could be created that guide investors from start to finish based on their unique circumstances and 
objectives.
•	
Voice-over navigation: Integrating voice command functionalities, especially in regional languages, could 
break down barriers for users who may not be comfortable with text-based navigation. This feature would 
empower a broader demographic to engage with financial platforms in a manner that feels natural and 
accessible.
•	
Nudges and warnings: Implementing behavioural nudges and timely warnings could help users make 
better financial decisions. For instance, reminders about risk levels or prompts to review investments would 
help investors stay informed and make prudent choices.
•	
Suggestive bite-sized educational guides: Offering short, digestible educational content could provide 
users with the necessary knowledge to make informed decisions. These guides could be integrated into the 
user journey, providing context and clarity at crucial decision points.
3.	 Collaborative support
•	
One-click assistance: User confidence would be enhanced by providing immediate, accessible support 
through one-click assistance features, such as chatbots, AI-driven help desks or live support options, 
ensuring users are never stranded in their investment journeys.
•	
Collaborative features: Allowing users to share their investment journeys with family or financial advisors 
could provide additional support and confidence. Features that enable collaboration could facilitate 
discussions and decisions, ensuring that users are not navigating financial landscapes alone.
•	
Feedback loops: Providing users with the ability to provide feedback on their experience could help 
continuously refine and improve the platform. Financial services can adapt and evolve by actively listening to 
user inputs to meet changing user needs and preferences.

Key considerations for stakeholder action
Achieving mass financial accessibility requires coordinated efforts from key stakeholders. A strategic and structured 
approach ensures that all players contribute to a more inclusive mutual fund ecosystem.
Asset management companies 
•	
Simplify apps and platforms to enhance user-friendliness and intuitive navigation.
•	
Leverage AI for personalised experiences, behavioural nudges and interactive educational guides.
•	
Partner with technology platforms to provide intelligent assistance and user-friendly features.
•	
Equip the distributor and RIA network with digital and AI-driven tools to facilitate better client conversations and 
intelligence-driven recommendations.
Financial advisors and distributors
•	
Develop user-centric platforms that incorporate regional language support and intuitive design.
•	
Train advisors to communicate financial concepts simply while respecting cultural nuances.
•	
Utilise AI tools to present investment options clearly and simplify investor decision-making.
•	
Design clean, prioritised dashboards that minimise cognitive overload.
•	
Ensure a seamless and consistent experience across both physical and digital channels.
Regulatory bodies
•	
Continue refining the guidelines for terminology simplification, platform usability and partnering with local 
communities.
•	
Encourage hackathons and sandbox initiatives to drive FinTech-led solutions that enhance investor experience 
and accessibility.
•	
Strengthen efforts towards system interoperability and open architecture across AMCs to promote seamless 
collaboration and innovation.
Registrar and transfer agents (RTAs)
•	
RTAs provide the necessary infrastructure for platform enhancements and seamless integration with financial 
intermediaries.
•	
Standardising processes, from onboarding to redemption, across AMCs while ensuring intuitive, small steps
•	
Vernacular onboarding flows coupled with e-KYC integration to ease the entry process.
By aligning efforts across these stakeholders, financial accessibility would move beyond rhetoric to execution – 
making mutual funds genuinely inclusive for all segments of society.
The solution requires a thoughtful recalibration of the approach, not oversimplifying. There is a need for:
•	
contextual design that speaks multiple languages – literally and metaphorically
•	
interfaces that adapt to individual financial literacy levels
•	
training programmes that equip financial advisors with emotional intelligence
•	
technology that simplifies without sacrificing sophistication.
B. Reimagining relevance: Cultural narratives and product innovation in India’s mutual 
fund ecosystem
In the intricate tapestry of India’s economic transformation, mutual funds are more than just a financial  
instrument – they are potentially a catalyst for widespread economic empowerment. To realise this potential, we 
would benefit from revisiting the understanding that innovation is not about creating uniform solutions but rather 
about crafting experiences that resonate with India’s diverse landscape.
1.	 Product innovation: A holistic ecosystem of financial solutions
The future of mutual funds potentially lies in products that are not just investments but also life companions. The 
multifaceted nature of Indian financial aspirations will drive product strategy.
28 | PwC | The mutual funds route to Viksit Bharat @2047
Life-stage and goal-based products
Lifecycle-based hybrid funds are another innovative 
frontier. Inspired by the US 401(k) system, these 
funds dynamically shift from equity to debt 
exposure as investors approach retirement. For 
women, conservative hybrid funds aligned with 
financial independence goals can be developed. 
More customised options consistent with solution-
oriented schemes linked to personal milestones, 
such as weddings, education or home ownership, 
can foster financial confidence.
Similar to 529 plans in the US, educational 
investment accounts offer tailored saving solutions 
for educational goals. These accounts can be 
adapted to meet state-specific needs, providing 
tax advantages and investment growth for parents 
preparing for their children’s futures.
Lifestyle-based investment plans synchronise 
financial planning with personal aspirations, offering 
Thematic and specialised funds: Bridging diversity through innovation
In the quest to align investment opportunities with India’s vast and varied socioeconomic landscape, thematic and 
specialised funds are a powerful mechanism to address the unique challenges of Indian diversity. These funds 
are not just financial instruments but rather vehicles for integrating cultural, regional and personal narratives into 
investment strategies.
Cultural and community investments
•	
Cultural investment funds can be a transformative tool, 
designed to support industries that reflect India’s rich 
cultural heritage. By investing in traditional crafts, local 
artisans and regional tourism, these funds link financial 
growth and cultural preservation, turning investments into 
vehicles for sustaining India’s diverse traditions.
•	
Community-based micro-investment platforms, 
inspired by global crowdfunding models, enable rural 
communities to pool resources and invest in local 
projects. This approach mirrors the community investment 
practices common in Africa and Latin America, where local 
populations drive economic development according to their 
unique needs.
•	
Funds capitalising the key trends can attract and engage 
newer segments aligned with emerging trends, including 
entertainment, lifestyle, fashion, art, religious tourism and 
content creation. This approach takes its cues from product 
innovation around South Korean pop culture.
portfolios tailored to various life stages or interests, such as travel or wellness. Much like lifestyle brands that 
resonate with individual identities, this approach integrates financial growth with personal narratives.
The retirement phase, often viewed with apprehension due to income uncertainty, can be transformed through 
thoughtfully structured systematic withdrawal plans (SWPs), providing retirees with a predictable income stream 
and turning accumulated wealth into reliable funding of daily living expenses. By customising SWPs to align 
with individual retirement goals and financial needs, retirees can have peace of mind and financial stability. For 
instance, SWPs can be designed to gradually reduce withdrawals as other income sources, such as pensions or 
annuities, ensuring a seamless transition into retirement.
The mutual funds route to Viksit Bharat @2047 | PwC | 29
The mutual fund industry can address the diverse needs of India’s population more holistically by incorporating these 
innovative solutions. Through these strategies, investments will be financially rewarding and culturally and socially 
meaningful, paving the way for a more inclusive and dynamic economic future.
2.	 Communication and campaigns: The cultural transformation playbook
The most revolutionary campaigns in India’s consumer landscape did not replace cultural practices – they 
enhanced and extended them. This cultural integration approach offers a potent blueprint for mutual fund 
adoption.
Learning from successful cultural campaigns
Social and environmental impact products
•	
Social impact bonds offer another innovative frontier. They align 
financial returns with positive social outcomes and focus on regional 
challenges, such as diversity, education, healthcare or sustainable 
infrastructure development, making these bonds attractive to 
investors interested in making a tangible difference, similar to 
successful implementations in global markets.
•	
Localised green bonds of private enterprises, urban local bodies and 
development finance institutions are used to finance environmental 
projects that resonate with regional priorities, such as solar farms or 
water conservation efforts. By aligning with global green bond markets, 
these investments generate returns and foster local environmental 
impact.
Technology-driven investment innovations
•	
Dynamic risk funds leverage AI and machine learning to adapt 
investment strategies based on evolving investor profiles. This 
personalised approach, much like adaptive learning technologies in 
education, caters to the diverse financial literacy levels across India by 
providing tailored risk management solutions.
•	
Digital asset platforms for traditional assets utilise blockchain 
technology to democratise access to wealth-building opportunities. 
By tokening assets like gold or real estate, these platforms make 
traditional investments accessible to a broader audience.
Baby diaper brands did 
not attempt to abolish 
traditional cloth diapering 
practices. Instead, they 
demonstrated how modern 
diapers could make 
parenting easier, more 
hygienic and less stressful. 
They created products that 
complemented established 
parental practices, not 
replaced them.
The telecom revolution 
was not about introducing 
an alien technology, but 
rather about making digital 
connectivity an extension 
of the existing social 
networks. Industry players 
created interfaces in local 
languages and developed 
region-specific content 
packages, making the 
technology feel familiar 
and accessible.
The Pulse Polio 
campaign is perhaps the 
most vivid example of 
cultural transformation. 
Rather than attacking 
traditional beliefs, the 
campaign worked through 
community leaders, 
religious figures and local 
influencers, transforming 
vaccinations from a 
medical intervention into a 
community movement.
The infant food industry 
players did not just sell 
baby food; they became 
nutrition partners. By 
understanding regional 
dietary practices, they 
created products that 
complemented traditional 
weaning methods, making 
modern nutrition feel like a 
natural progression.

Mutual fund campaign strategy	
In the context of mutual funds, these examples inspire us to give the ‘suitability’ messages with greater emphasis on 
the following:
•	
vernacular interfaces that include local languages
•	
culturally aligned campaigns that respect local financial wisdom
•	
financial literacy drives that work through community networks
•	
multisensory approaches for underserved demographics.
The strategy involves:
•	
deep ethnographic research
•	
understanding the micro market
•	
cultural sensitivity
•	
adding instead of replacing value.
Key considerations for stakeholder action

The mutual funds route to Viksit Bharat @2047 | PwC | 31
1.	 Visually challenged and specially abled individuals
•	
Accessible digital platforms: Develop platforms compatible with screen readers and provide audio 
descriptions for visually impaired users. Ensuring that investment platforms meet accessibility standards 
can make mutual funds more approachable for those with visual impairments.
•	
Braille and audio educational materials: Offering educational resources in Braille and audio formats can help 
visually challenged individuals understand investment opportunities and make informed decisions.
•	
Partnerships with NGOs: Collaborating with NGOs specialising in supporting the visually impaired can 
facilitate outreach and provide targeted support, ensuring the design of inclusive financial products.
2.	 Gig workers – freelancers, delivery pilots, part-time and temporary workers 
•	
Flexible investment products: Develop products that cater to the irregular income patterns of gig workers, 
such as flexible SIPs that allow for variable contributions based on monthly earnings.
•	
Tax and compliance guidance: Provide resources and advisory services that help gig workers navigate tax 
implications and compliance issues related to their investments, simplifying their financial planning.
•	
Community-based financial literacy programmes: Organise workshops and seminars specifically for gig 
workers, addressing their unique financial challenges and opportunities.
•	
Explore partnerships with established organisations and institutions that typically employ such workforces 
to facilitate their integration into the investment ecosystem. These organisations can manage the onboarding 
process, paperwork and the option for employees to make voluntary contributions from their payouts, 
simplifying the overall journey.
3.	 Illiterate and semi-illiterate individuals
•	
Visual and audio communication: Develop communication strategies that rely on visual cues, symbols 
and audio instructions to convey investment information, making investing accessible to those with limited 
reading skills.
•	
Local language support: Ensure that all communications and customer service interactions can take place in 
regional languages, lowering barriers to entry for non-English speakers.
•	
Simplified onboarding: Streamline the onboarding process with minimal paperwork and straightforward 
instructions, utilising biometric identification where possible to ease accessibility.
Assessing viability and impact
1.	 Data-driven insights: Conduct comprehensive market research to understand these untapped segments’ size 
and specific needs, ensuring accurate demographic data inform product development. To add some context, 
India has 62 million visually impaired individuals and approximately 8 million blind people50 – i.e. roughly 70 
million individuals who cannot access the mutual fund industry on their own. Similarly, India has over 280 
million illiterate individuals,51 over 10 million gig workers,52 about 450 million blue-collar workers53 and 30 million 
differently abled individuals.54
2.	 Pilot programmes: Implement pilot programmes in targeted communities to test the effectiveness of inclusive 
financial products and strategies and gather feedback for continual improvement.
3.	 Impact measurement: Establish metrics to assess inclusive financial initiatives’ social and economic impact, 
ensuring that efforts translate into tangible benefits for these communities.
Key considerations for stakeholder action
Asset management companies 
•	
Assess product gaps to ensure the inclusiveness and viability of micro investments.
•	
Ensure adherence to regulatory guidelines regarding inclusive product structures.

The mutual funds route to Viksit Bharat @2047 | PwC | 33
I. The psychological landscape of Indian investments
Central to India’s financial transformation is a complex psychological terrain shaped by generations of financial 
conservatism, familial wisdom and deep-rooted economic uncertainties. Investment behaviour is not merely a 
financial choice but a profound cultural narrative that has been carefully crafted through decades of collective 
experience.
Indian households have historically viewed money through the lens of preservation instead of growth. In addition to 
fixed deposits, gold and real estate being investment instruments, they were established protective shields against 
economic uncertainties. This mindset goes beyond financial caution; it expresses a deeply rooted approach to 
achieving stability and resilience first, passed down through generations.
Psychological barriers to financial participation
Transforming the mutual fund ecosystem requires first understanding the intricate psychological obstacles to broad 
financial participation.
1.	 Generational financial trauma
It is not uncommon for households in India to hold onto shared financial memories of economic hardship. 
Stories of lost investments, speculative failures and financial setbacks create generational risk aversion. For 
instance, a family that lost savings during an economic downturn might pass down a narrative of financial 
hesitance that persists for decades.
2.	 Collective decision-making dynamics
Unlike individualistic western financial models, Indian investment decisions are complex negotiations involving 
multiple family members. Individual financial risk differs considerably – a potential loss is not just personal but 
probably affects the entire family’s financial security.
3. 	 Trust as a primary currency
In the Indian context, trust is not a metric calculated through financial ratios; instead, it is a holistic assessment 
constructed over generations. Financial institutions are evaluated on returns and their ability to demonstrate 
reliability, stability and alignment with community values.
II. Strategic intervention frameworks
To dismantle these psychological barriers, a multidimensional approach that goes beyond traditional financial 
literacy is needed.
1.	 Neuroscience and behavioural economics in finance
Neuroscience of financial decision-making: This requires acknowledging that investment decisions are 
fundamentally emotional journeys. 
•	
Map cognitive biases: Understand how loss aversion, status quo bias and fear of complexity prevent 
financial participation.
•	
Develop emotional intelligence in financial communication.
•	
Create narratives that address psychological reservations.
Behavioural economics of mass financial adoption: The ultimate goal is to transform investments from an 
occasional decision to an instinctive financial habit through the following:
•	
default enrolment in micro-SIPs
•	
life goal-linked investment reminders
•	
contextual nudges that normalise investing.
2.	 Cross-cultural and early investment education
Cross-cultural investment behaviour research: India’s financial ecosystem is a complex mosaic of regional, 
cultural and economic diversity. The research should accomplish the following:
•	
Develop a sophisticated psychological mapping.
•	
Create culturally nuanced communication strategies.
•	
Design products aligned with community aspirations.
34 | PwC | The mutual funds route to Viksit Bharat @2047
Embedding an investment culture early: Taking cues from various initiatives, instilling an investment culture 
in the early stages is important, through school curricula like Money Sense for Youth, Singapore; Financial 
Capability Curriculum, UK and Money Smart Programme in Australia. Introducing investment concepts 
and financial literacy into school curricula cultivate an early understanding and appreciation for financial 
planning. Educating students about mutual funds and investment strategies fosters a generation that views 
financial growth as a natural and attainable goal, effectively embedding an investment culture from a young age.
•	
Introduce investment concepts into school curricula.
•	
Foster financial literacy from a young age.
•	
Cultivate a generation that understands financial growth.
The technology–human interface:
•	
AI-driven personalised financial counselling
•	
Predictive analytics for individual financial journeys
•	
Emotional intelligence in financial platforms
•	
Simplified user experiences that reduce anxiety
3.	 Transformative communication strategies
•	
Learn from cross-sectoral innovations by:
	-
developing an ‘investor accessibility guide’
	-
simplifying financial terminology
	-
providing clear, contextual communication
	-
ensuring comprehension across linguistic and literacy barriers.
•	
Respect existing cultural wisdom.
•	
Demonstrate how modern financial instruments complement traditional savings mechanisms.
•	
Position investments as tools of empowerment.
•	
Create narratives that feel simultaneously revolutionary and familiar.
4.	 Institutional strategy
•	
Financial institutions should build upon their successful efforts to drive psychological transformation.
•	
Embed behavioural science in distributor training.
•	
Develop comprehensive accessibility standards.
•	
Create personalised financial communication strategies.
•	
Establish trust-building initiatives in sceptical markets.
The deeper transformation
We are not simply creating financial literacy. We are reimagining financial participation as a core principle and a 
pathway to individual and collective economic empowerment.
The mutual fund industry is at a crossroads. It has an opportunity to transform itself from a financial product provider 
to a catalyst of economic imagination for millions of Indians. By creating progressive and respectful narratives, we 
seek to unlock a new era of financial participation.
Key considerations for stakeholder action
Regulatory bodies
•	
Encourage collaborative studies with financial institutions to explore the role of behavioural economics and 
cognitive biases in investment decisions.
•	
Strengthen integration with national financial literacy programmes and expand partnerships with schools to 
foster early investment literacy.
Asset management companies 
•	
Build trust through transparent communication on pricing, market risks and growth potential.
•	
Ensure prompt mechanisms to redress grievances and maintain investor confidence.
•	
Provide personalised updates and nudges to investors, helping them track progress towards their financial 
goals.
The mutual funds route to Viksit Bharat @2047 | PwC | 35
Distributors and influencers
•	
Highlight the power of compounding through real-life success stories.
•	
Conduct regular check-ins with investors and offer guidance at key financial milestones.
By embedding behavioural insights into financial strategies, the mutual fund industry can drive a more extensive 
transformation that increases participation and redefines investing as a fundamental aspect of financial wellbeing.
E.	 Last-mile connectivity: Bridging gaps in mutual fund access 
Expanding mutual fund access to Tier-2, Tier-3 and rural markets requires innovative solutions to ensure last-mile 
connectivity. Democratising access to mutual funds begins by addressing the dual needs of reach and trust. Despite 
digital platforms’ remarkable progress in breaking geographical barriers, the human connection provided by physical 
touchpoints is irreplaceable – particularly for first-time investors seeking confidence and transparency before making 
financial decisions. Collaborations such as AMCs partnering with the Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) 
illustrate how financial products can be integrated into everyday spaces, such as kirana shops, turning these hubs 
into accessible financial touchpoints.
Ensuring last-mile  
connectivity
 Localised confidence 
and hyper-local  
guidance
Scalable models  
like ONDC 
Taking cues from 
global best  
practices 
Leveraging existing 
community networks 
for expansion
1.	 Localised confidence and hyper-local guidance: A farmer visiting his neighbourhood kirana shop to buy 
daily essentials could now encounter an opportunity to invest in mutual funds. At this crucial juncture, a 
knowledgeable local advisor – the shop owner or a trained facilitator – could make all the difference. This type of 
hyper-local guidance would address cultural and financial barriers, fostering trust and empowering individuals to 
take their first steps towards financial investment.
2.	 Scaling models like ONDC for greater impact: Stakeholders should continue to look for ways to integrate 
physical and digital networks to replicate and scale such initiatives across the industry. The key strategies 
include:
•	
Financial kiosks in local markets: High-traffic kiosks staffed by trained advisors could explain mutual fund 
products in regional languages while offering real-time onboarding with mobile technology.

Empowering local shop owners as financial ambassadors: Kirana shop owners could be equipped with 
digital tools to onboard customers, explain products and facilitate small-ticket SIPs, replicating the success 
of India’s Common Service Centres for government services.

3.	 Leveraging existing community networks for mutual fund expansion
Jan Seva Kendras, post offices and cooperatives provide community trust and accessibility that can be 
harnessed to expand mutual fund participation. By partnering with these entities, mutual funds could extend 
financial literacy initiatives, offer localised advisory services and facilitate personalised onboarding of new 
investors. Integrating mutual fund offerings into these networks leverages their existing infrastructure to 
provide real-time access and transactions, building on their credibility to foster trust and overcome investment 
scepticism. Furthermore, these centres would serve as valuable feedback channels to continuously refine and 
improve mutual fund products and services to meet local needs better.
4.	 Global best practices for last-mile connectivity: International examples provide valuable insights. In 
Kenya, investment products have been seamlessly incorporated into mobile wallets, reaching unbanked rural 
populations. Brazil’s correspondent banking programme enabled local businesses to act as financial agents, 
while China’s rural financial service stations brought advisory services to remote villages. These models 
illustrate the importance of blending technology with localised engagement.
Building scalable infrastructure and trust: To ensure scalability, AMCs and RTAs may consider investing in robust 
infrastructure supporting local training, vernacular outreach and digital onboarding. Technology would continue to be 
crucial in bridging access and addressing gaps, enabling efficient service delivery and greater inclusion. Simplified 
small-ticket SIP processes, incentives for distributors and the intermediary network and micro-investment options 
can encourage participation while building trust. This dual approach fosters sustainable growth and long-term 
investor confidence.
Towards ubiquitous financial inclusion: Imagine a future where mutual funds are as accessible as daily essentials, 
available at every corner store and through every smartphone. By leveraging industry collaboration, initiatives like 
ONDC and global best practices, the mutual fund ecosystem has the potential to become a cornerstone of financial 
inclusion, democratising wealth creation and empowering every Indian to participate in the nation’s economic 
growth.

and long-term engagement.
The mutual fund industry can transform accessibility and trust by strategically integrating technology with local 
engagement, making mutual funds as ubiquitous and essential as daily financial transactions.

Scaling mass campaigns  
with local flavour
Facilitating research  
and insights 
Championing investor-
centric policies
1.	 Scaling mass campaigns with local flavour: Building on the success of investor awareness campaigns 
such as ‘Mutual funds sahi hai’, AMFI can scale these initiatives into localised, regional formats reflecting the 
aspirations and challenges of India’s diverse communities by:
•	
tailoring campaigns for Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities, focusing on wealth stability and trust.
•	
introducing vernacular media strategies that resonate with different states’ cultural and linguistic nuances.
2.	 Championing investor-centric policies: As the industry’s representative body, AMFI could advocate for 
regulatory policies that democratise access and protect investor interests. For example:
•	
promoting SWPs as a cornerstone of retirement planning and reliable instruments for financial freedom.
•	
negotiating sustainability-linked incentives, encouraging AMCs to integrate ESG principles into their funds 
while maintaining long-term ecosystem stability.
3.	 Facilitating research and insights: AMFI could establish itself as the thought leader of the Indian mutual fund 
industry to stay ahead in a dynamic global market, conducting in-depth research on the following topics:
•	
regional financial literacy disparities and strategies to uplift low-literacy states.
•	
behavioural patterns that drive investment decisions across demographic segments, leveraging cross-
cultural studies to guide AMCs’ product innovation.
•	
measuring the industry’s inclusivity and accessibility using novel frameworks like the Inclusivity Index, 
Accessibility Score and Financial Empowerment Quotient.
By 2047, success will be measured not just by transaction volumes or technological sophistication, but by 
the ecosystem’s ability to democratise financial knowledge, reduce entry barriers and create pathways for 
inclusive wealth generation across India’s socioeconomic spectrum. Progress towards this vision requires 
continuous evolution, collaborative innovation and an unwavering commitment to balancing technological 
advancement with human-centric design principles.

Section 5: Impact and conclusion 
If the strategies and interventions outlined in Phase 3 are executed effectively, the mutual fund industry will be 
poised to achieve the ambitious milestones envisioned for India’s financial future. As Amrit Kaal progresses – 
ushering in an era of transformative economic growth and inclusivity – the figures projected for 2047 represent 
aspirations and attainable realities.
The exponential potential of this sector is reflected in the expected outcomes: a 6x increase in retail investors, 
a 10x rise in per-investor AUM and a mutual fund AUM-to-GDP ratio surpassing 100%.55 While optimistic, 
these projections are achievable goals provided the ecosystem embraces an adaptive, collaborative and investor-
centric approach. By addressing challenges such as accessibility, inclusivity and investor education, the industry 
can significantly deepen capital markets and mobilise funds into key sectors critical to nation-building, such as 
infrastructure, green energy and innovation.
This transformation will democratise wealth creation and foster robust capital formation, driving sustainable 
economic growth and ensuring mutual funds become a cornerstone of financial empowerment. The industry can 
create a nation where financial wellbeing is universally accessible, paving the way for a prosperous and equitable 
future.

Considerations
•	
The projections outlined in this paper are predicated on the basis of several key considerations that align with 
India’s economic trajectory and global financial market developments. Fundamental to these projections is 
India’s sustained economic growth, averaging 10% CAGR through 2047, in line with the Government of India’s 
vision of ‘Viksit Bharat 2047’, targeting a USD 30 trillion economy. This economic expansion is expected to 
drive significant growth in per capita income from INR 1.8 lakh to INR 16.5 lakh, creating a robust foundation for 
increased financial asset investment.56 
•	
The mutual fund industry’s growth trajectory has been benchmarked against 24 major economies with 
established mutual fund sectors, categorised by their GDP per capita levels. Analysis of emerging and 
developed markets suggests that India’s mutual fund AUM-to-GDP ratio can grow significantly, from 18.7% to 
112%, by 2047.57 Deepening market maturity and increased financialisation of household savings will support 
this expansion.
•	
The industry structure is expected to evolve towards global standards, particularly its market concentration. 
The dominance of top AMCs is projected to moderate from the current 40% market share to 30%, aligning with 
global benchmarks. Simultaneously, the operational efficiency of AMCs is anticipated to significantly improve, 
with the average AUM per AMC increasing tenfold, which is comparable to global standards. This will support 
the growth in AMCs from 44 to 212, creating a more competitive and diverse market landscape.
•	
The retail–institutional mix in mutual fund AUM is projected to shift gradually from the current 64:36 ratio to 
a 70:30 split by 2047, mirroring developed markets. Sustained market returns of 11% annually and increasing 
mutual fund penetration from nearly 3% to 15% of the population will support this transformation. The number of 
unique mutual fund investors is expected to grow from 4.5 crore to 26 crore during this period, with the average 
AUM per retail investor reaching INR 74 lakh, evidencing deeper market participation and increased wealth 
creation through mutual funds.
•	
The distribution network is projected to grow fivefold to support this expanding investor base, with the number 
of distributors/RIAs increasing from 2.07 lakh to nearly 10 lakh. This growth corresponds to the rising investor 
penetration and will be accompanied by increased efficiency, with the average AUM per distributor growing 
from INR 26 crore to INR 281 crore. This expansion in distribution capacity will be crucial for maintaining service 
quality and advisory support as the industry scales.
•	
These projections assume continued regulatory support for market development, sustained improvement in 
financial literacy and progressive adoption of technology, facilitating access to mutual fund investments. The 
growth trajectory also factors in increasing penetration in Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities, greater participation from 
younger investors and a sustained shift in savings and investment vehicles from physical to financial assets.

Conclusion
The Indian mutual fund industry stands at a historic inflection point, having taken decisive steps towards enabling 
widespread financial wellbeing in a nation with over 1.4 billion aspirations. While developed markets such as the US 
achieved 5-10x growth58 in mutual fund AUM over 44 years, India is uniquely positioned to accelerate this journey 
significantly, powered by its digital public infrastructure and demographic dividend. 
With technological advantages like UPI, the account aggregator framework and ONDC, supported by forward-
thinking regulation and operating at global efficiency standards, the industry is well-positioned to compress this 
growth timeline into just 24 years. This transformation mirrors India’s leapfrogging journey in digital payments, where 
we developed a world-class infrastructure that processes more digital transactions than the US, the UK, Germany 
and France combined. 
The road ahead focuses on developing deeper understandings and serving the Indian investor through solutions that 
balance inclusivity with appropriate incentives across the value chain, leveraging India’s robust digital architecture to 
develop seamless, trust-based interactions. 
With a projected sixfold growth in customer base and a tenfold increase in per-investor AUM, driven by initiatives 
emphasising simplicity, relevance, behavioural and mindset change, inclusivity and last-mile delivery, the industry is 
poised to catalyse India’s wealth creation story. This growth will be further magnified by India’s expanding middle 
class, increasing financial literacy and the shift from physical to financial savings. 
As we navigate this era of abundant choice, the commitment to guiding investors towards suitable products will 
democratise wealth creation and contribute substantially to India’s economic prosperity, potentially adding several 
percentage points to the GDP through efficient capital allocation. The next quarter-century or the ‘Amrit Kaal’ 
promises to be transformative, as India becomes a nation where financial wellbeing is not just an aspiration but a 
widespread reality, creating a model for emerging economies worldwide. Just as India showed the world how to 
build digital public goods at the population scale, we are also positioned to demonstrate how to achieve financial 
inclusion and wealth creation at an unprecedented scale and velocity.
As we envision the trajectory towards Viksit Bharat 2047, the promise of financial wellbeing transcends the 
boundaries of mere inclusion. This paper has articulated a vision where financial systems are enablers and catalysts 
of personal and national growth. The strategies and frameworks outlined here are designed to transition from a 
model of access to one of empowerment, ensuring that every Indian citizen can thrive within the financial ecosystem.
The journey from financial inclusion to financial wellbeing is not a linear path; it is a dynamic process requiring all 
stakeholders’ collaboration, innovation and commitment. If executed effectively, the strategies laid out in this paper 
will potentially multiply retail investors, elevate per capita asset management and integrate mutual funds into the 
fabric of everyday financial decision-making. By embracing inclusivity, fostering innovation and prioritising education, 
we can create a financial landscape that is equitable, resilient and robust – paving the way for a future where 
financial wellbeing is not just an aspiration but a universal reality. Despite the challenges of the road ahead, with 
concerted efforts, the destination is within our reach.
