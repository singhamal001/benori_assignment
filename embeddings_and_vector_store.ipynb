    "## Overview\n",
    "This script processes text data from multiple Parquet files, generates embeddings using the Google GenAI API, and stores them in a ChromaDB collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "- Python\n",
    "- Libraries: `os`, `pandas`, `chromadb`, `tqdm`, `dotenv`, `google.genai`\n",
    "- Environment Variables:\n",
    "  - `CHROMA_DB_PERSIST_DIRECTORY`: Path for ChromaDB persistence.\n",
    "  - `GENAI_API_KEY`: API key for Google GenAI.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Steps\n",
    "1. **Load Environment Variables**\n",
    "   - Load API keys and directory paths using `dotenv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Initialize Clients**\n",
    "   - Create ChromaDB and GenAI clients.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Load Data**\n",
    "   - Read and concatenate Parquet files into a DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Chunking Text**\n",
    "   - Define `chunk_text()` to split text into manageable pieces for embedding.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Generate Embeddings**\n",
    "   - Use `genai.Client` to create embeddings for each text chunk.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Store in ChromaDB**\n",
    "   - Save embeddings, metadata, and documents into the ChromaDB collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Output\n",
    "- Confirms the number of embeddings stored.\n",
